29/03/2018, 09:55 - Rob;: The honking gif in particular
29/03/2018, 10:41 - Damian Rumble: What is this
29/03/2018, 10:45 - Rob;: It's just text messages
29/03/2018, 10:51 - Damian Rumble: Facebexit
29/03/2018, 12:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Is this now the thread? Are we deleting facebook?
29/03/2018, 12:46 - Damian Rumble: Tbh I would prefer to stay with Facebook. The main reason is that can't interact with WhatsApp on a PC and that reduces it's functionally.... Mainly Phil sending his
Giffs.
29/03/2018, 12:47 - Phill: Who uses a PC for communicating these days?
29/03/2018, 12:47 - Damian Rumble: Also Facebook having our data is not a problem to me. This is 21st century.... We are always seeking our data to someone. It cannot be avoided.
29/03/2018, 12:48 - Damian Rumble: But I'm not that butthurt. If everyone wants to do WhatsApp then that's fine.
29/03/2018, 12:48 - Phill: Mark, is that you?
29/03/2018, 12:55 - Rob;: You can get WhatsApp on a pc Damo

29/03/2018, 18:56 - David;: damo, my problem is not with someone 'having my data' in general. It's got nothing to do with personal privacy concerns, but relates to:

1) not supporting a service that uses its user data in retarded anti-democratic ways, thereby legitimising such usage policies

2) the fact i don't want to be bombarded with all of the facebook functionality, adverts, status updates etc. just to communicate with a few friends

3) wanting to reduce dependence on a single social media platform thus counteracting monopolistic tendencies which encourage abuses of customer data in general.

Rage, rage like a bellend in the night
29/03/2018, 19:43 - David;: And that's dylan thomas
29/03/2018, 21:25 - Sam;: That‚Äôs what Thomas really meant. He was talking about his bellend
29/03/2018, 21:25 - Paul Dickinson: I feel like it really conveys the message of men‚Äôs rights as well

30/03/2018, 15:59 - Paul Dickinson: They don‚Äôt have that out this way. Five guys is similar though
30/03/2018, 16:17 - David;: They've gone long on quality. Choice is over
30/03/2018, 16:32 - Rob;: Apparently Five Guys is good in America. It's dogshit here. Basically McDonald's
30/03/2018, 16:33 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah it‚Äôs a good burger over here

30/03/2018, 18:17 - David;: The bacon is shite though. Never get bacon anything
30/03/2018, 18:19 - Paul Dickinson: They have delusional bacon over here
30/03/2018, 18:19 - David;: They haven't got the bacon memo
30/03/2018, 18:23 - Rob;: I've never been anywhere else that got bacon right
30/03/2018, 18:23 - Rob;: Save our bacon. Take back control.
30/03/2018, 18:54 - Damian Rumble: I find it funny when Americans complain we have shit bacon. How can so many people be so objectively wrong? It's like an entire nation believing the earth is flat
30/03/2018, 20:25 - / James Ball: I've not heard them complain about our bacon. Just not understand it

31/03/2018, 12:06 - Rob;: Perfect
31/03/2018, 12:06 - / James Ball: In a Lidl near you
31/03/2018, 18:43 - Rob;: Sam would you prefer to lose next week rather than see City win it at Old Trafford?
31/03/2018, 18:47 - Sam;: It‚Äôs being played at the shitihad next week... ?
31/03/2018, 18:48 - Rob;: Ah, I thought there was a game in between
31/03/2018, 18:49 - Rob;: And thought it was at old Trafford. Talking double bollocks
31/03/2018, 18:59 - Sam;: Very spicy rice. But they can win it next week so the butt hurt would be very real
31/03/2018, 19:01 - Rob;: A Mourinho away against a good side 0-0 special, surely
31/03/2018, 19:09 - Sam;: Surely. Could actually work though as city might push for the title win and get caught on the break
31/03/2018, 19:11 - Rob;: He's a real pain, Niasse

01/04/2018, 15:21 - Rob;: You fantasy cunts getting in Aubemeyang
01/04/2018, 15:22 - Rob;: Glad he gave that penalty to Lacazette
01/04/2018, 15:27 - David;: Yeah - fuck that decision, with a guyon a hat trick. Just seemed like a troll against your own player
01/04/2018, 15:28 - Rob;: But little Lacazette ha been very upset that Mr Wenger bought another striker and needed cheering up
01/04/2018, 18:12 - Damian Rumble: No Kane no problem
01/04/2018, 20:44 - Phill: Damo I must know where the Chinese space lab is going to fall
01/04/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: Well it's not going to fall in the UK if that will make you feel any better
01/04/2018, 20:49 - Rob;: Is the Chinese space agency headquarters within the latitude range it can fall? Just have it back
01/04/2018, 20:50 - Damian Rumble: I think it is
01/04/2018, 20:51 - Paul Dickinson: Where is it falling?
01/04/2018, 20:52 - Rob;: Between 40¬∞ both and south of the equator I think?
01/04/2018, 20:53 - Rob;: But far more likely at 40¬∞ either way than in between
01/04/2018, 20:53 - Paul Dickinson: No direct location yet?
01/04/2018, 20:54 - Phill: I hope it crashed into a heavily civilised region, taking thousands of lives, plunging us into another dark age
01/04/2018, 20:55 - / James Ball: They won't know until it's basically impossible to move anyone out if the way
01/04/2018, 20:56 - Phill: Like Jodie Marie Bott-Brain
01/04/2018, 20:56 - Rob;: Yeah because it's orbiting you can't tell where it lands until it starts falling
01/04/2018, 20:57 - Phill: I thought the whole point of gravity was that it was predictable as fuck
01/04/2018, 20:57 - Rob;: Apparently orbital dynamics are extremely hard to predict at closer distances
01/04/2018, 20:57 - Phill: Explain yourself
01/04/2018, 20:57 - Phill: I get atmospheric resistance
01/04/2018, 20:58 - Phill: But how can we land probes on other planets

01/04/2018, 20:58 - Phill: But when it comes to our own, were like Lacazette in the box
01/04/2018, 20:58 - Rob;: That's where all the information I have came from
01/04/2018, 20:59 - Rob;: We control probes, where as the Chinese have lost control of the space station
01/04/2018, 20:59 - Phill: But physics still applies
01/04/2018, 21:00 - Phill: Regardless of whether it is in, or out of, control
01/04/2018, 21:00 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/04/2018, 21:01 - Rob;: 'At low altitudes (anything under about 2,000km), orbital mechanics is a surprisingly imprecise science. Earth‚Äôs thin outer atmosphere exerts a measurable drag on anything in such an orbit, and this drag means that, without regular boosts, that object will fall out of orbit eventually. The drag itself, however, is not constant. So exactly when this fiery fall will happen is hard to say in advance.'
01/04/2018, 21:02 - Phill: >not knowing when the fiery fall will happen

01/04/2018, 21:08 - Damian Rumble: It's almost like the weather is a chaotic system that cannot be predicted accurately
01/04/2018, 21:09 - Rob;: Jack's house is the only possible place it can fall outside of that latitude range
01/04/2018, 21:09 - Phill: But you can predict it fine on Mars...
01/04/2018, 21:10 - Phill: Science is fake news I swear
01/04/2018, 21:10 - Damian Rumble: Mars has a lot less atmosphere than earth
01/04/2018, 21:10 - Phill: Whatever
01/04/2018, 21:10 - Phill: Stephen
01/04/2018, 21:10 - Damian Rumble: And a lot of Mars missions have still failed

01/04/2018, 23:01 - David;: Lol, just catching up on the space news. Fiery falls clasically something you'd want to get some sense of

03/04/2018, 21:54 - Sam;: It‚Äôs a good one
03/04/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: Young Ball can tell
03/04/2018, 21:54 - Sam;: Save it for in person
03/04/2018, 21:54 - / James Ball: Back at uni i had an appointment with this careers person to get CV advice
03/04/2018, 21:54 - / James Ball: Too late
03/04/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: I'd recommend saving him as Ball Ball so you get he message 'Ball is typing'
03/04/2018, 21:54 - Sam;: Lol
03/04/2018, 21:55 - / James Ball: You had to fill in a brief questionnaire about why you were there and then wait to be called in
03/04/2018, 21:57 - / James Ball: So I filled in my form and waited. Someone eventually stuck their head out of an office: "Ball?"
03/04/2018, 21:57 - / James Ball: So I stand up and go in and have chat through some things
03/04/2018, 21:58 - / James Ball: Some unusual questions fired my way: "that's an unusual name" "do you like to be called James normally then as on your CV?"
03/04/2018, 21:58 - David;: Ha, dying already
03/04/2018, 21:58 - / James Ball: I'm starting to get pretty confused as to why they think James is so unusual
03/04/2018, 21:59 - / James Ball: Turns out in a delusional state I had managed to fill out the questionnaire with "ball" as both first and surname. They legit thought my name was "ball ball"
03/04/2018, 22:00 - / James Ball: Which I was then backing up by saying things like "of course that's my name, it's not unusual, it's just what my parents gave me"
03/04/2018, 22:01 - David;: Haha
03/04/2018, 22:01 - Rob;: It's too much even on second hearing
03/04/2018, 22:01 - David;: Ah. So good
03/04/2018, 22:01 - Rob;: It's a very common name
03/04/2018, 22:02 - / James Ball: Just ball ball here, the completely normal person
03/04/2018, 22:02 - David;: I love that they went with that line of subtle probing questions rather than instantly realise what had happened
03/04/2018, 22:03 - / James Ball: Let's talk about your CV, which although it clearly lists a different name let's assume that's just some kind of nickname
03/04/2018, 22:04 - David;: Lol
03/04/2018, 22:04 - Rob;: Yeah, the CV must be the mistake
03/04/2018, 22:04 - / James Ball: It's far more reasonable that you would have a borderline speech disorder name
03/04/2018, 22:04 - Rob;: This new and unchecked form hlds his true name
03/04/2018, 22:05 - David;: 'He must have just invented that at school as a pseudonym to avoid bullying'
03/04/2018, 22:06 - / James Ball: Occams razor
03/04/2018, 22:07 - / James Ball: Clearly the most obvious answer
03/04/2018, 22:08 - David;: Oh god. Been unable to breath for the last 3 minutes
03/04/2018, 22:09 - David;: Just regaining lung capacity
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: Had a very strange experience this morning. My housemates mum stayed over Easter while I was away, but she's still there now. Simon had mentioned she has a few strange views but I put that down to the N Irish traditional protestant thing
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: Oh no
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: I'm ironing my shirt, she's at the kitchen table in her laptop with what looks like a pretty self school digibox plugged into it
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: She asked if I knew anything about computers so I looked over and her cursor was moving without her touching it and she said a Russian was fixing it
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: Then said she knew there was a bug on it (meaning the weird box) but the I support said there couldn't be. I said if if was a rare bit of kit then maybe it wouldn't be worth the while for people to develop a virus for it
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: Then she was like 'oh no, the hackers are after these. They're very important' and I made the mistake of asking what it is
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: It's a Rife Machine. An unapproved cancer treatment that 'scans your body' and kills bad cells with waves. She started telling me about how the government wanted them all destroyed so they could keep treating people with treatments that make more money
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: She put her headphones on and was like 'I'm being scanned now'
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: She was telling me how money is the route of all evil and that had led to all the research on it being burned by the government in Germany in the 1920s
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: I looked it up, mostly it seems there hasn't been much research into it because it isn't very promising  http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/cancer-in-general/treatment/complementary-alternative-therapies/individual-therapies/rife-machine-and-cancer
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: I think she may _treat_ people with it for a living
04/04/2018, 09:11 - Rob;: *a pretty _old_ school digibox.
04/04/2018, 09:14 - / James Ball: Sounds scarily close to the Scientology machine that reads how good you were in a past life (E-meter)
04/04/2018, 09:14 - / James Ball: I hope you offered to be treated
04/04/2018, 09:19 - Rob;: I've had a brush with those too. A very old man who went round calibrating the monitors at Framestore turned out to be a influential figure in the development of E-meters. Tom Cruise asked for a meeting with him when he came in to talk about a film
04/04/2018, 09:39 - / James Ball: It was is written. You will be a scientologist

04/04/2018, 17:16 - Rob;: Mutant Ronaldo Vs a good bust of someone else
04/04/2018, 17:19 - Paul Dickinson: New one looks like generic hitler youth

05/04/2018, 17:52 - David;: Lol. Intro to a post on the liverpool forum:
05/04/2018, 17:52 - David;: Everton v Liverpool

It was dark at Bramley Moore Docks. The rain fell and the overturned bins of garbage danced in the winds. A couple of dead seagulls turned their faces to the sky as if to ask a vital question...
What the fuck is that noise lad?

That was us kid.

That was Anfield on a European night, drowning the whole of the city with a roar heard around the world. That was the Kop giving loads to world football's most overpriced vanity project.¬†

That was the sound Guardiola will be hearing in his dreams the rest of his days. He will twitch and stir, almost waking, before the sound fades and he falls back to strangely troubled dreams, haunted by a feeling of doom he can never put a finger on.

That was the pop of the sheik's bubble.

The brownfield site of the dock, in contrast, was silent. It may stay silent quite a while.
05/04/2018, 22:55 - Rob;: Pontus Wernbloom (of CSKA Moscow). Excellent name

06/04/2018, 15:15 - David;: On playmaker Manuel Lanzini's fitness Moyes added: "He's got a medial ligament injury. He's able to run in straight lines at the minute. I wouldn't completely rule him out but he's a doubt."
06/04/2018, 15:16 - David;: Would love if that was literally true - like a castle in chess. But still fine to play
06/04/2018, 15:17 - David;: Combines him with a player who can only run diagonally for the perfect midfield
06/04/2018, 15:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Your need someone who can only jump in an l-shape to complete the tactical unit

10/04/2018, 21:17 - Damian Rumble: Bollocks
10/04/2018, 21:17 - Damian Rumble: And by that mean 'citation needed'

10/04/2018, 21:43 - Phill: He's south American...
10/04/2018, 21:43 - Paul Dickinson: O RLY
10/04/2018, 21:43 - Phill: They're hard for Barca

11/04/2018, 07:59 - Rob;: They haven't, but the stickers and book wouldn't have time to be designed and printed in the two weeks between the squads are revealed and the first match
11/04/2018, 08:04 - Damian Rumble: Fair
11/04/2018, 08:12 - Damian Rumble: You might enjoy this story Phil. Last week I had a random phone call. It was a man from the local lib Dems. He was expecting me to stand to run in the local elections for them in may. I explained that I had made an enquiry about this about 6months ago but they'd forgotten to get back to me. Never the less I agreed to sign up and I had this middle aged man turn up at my house after my signature along side 10 other signatures nominating me. Yesterday I had an email from the same man saying that there had been some anomalies in the those 10 additional signatures and that the lib Dems had been barred from standing from election in hackney this year.
11/04/2018, 08:13 - Damian Rumble: Can't even do basic paper work correctly. And You wonder why the LDs are doing so badly...
11/04/2018, 08:48 - David;: 'But all of these signatures were daubed on a wall in shit. We can't accept it as an electoral nomination'
11/04/2018, 13:32 - David;: Just read that 'radio 1 are going in search of a younger audience' - do todlers even listen to radio?
11/04/2018, 13:36 - Rob;: Yeah they've been legitimising losing lots of listeners by saying they were all old people and they didn't want them listening anyway
11/04/2018, 13:36 - Paul Dickinson: Isn‚Äôt it just complete shit anyway? Do they not realize?
11/04/2018, 13:38 - Rob;: The proliferation of digital radio probably does incentivise more specific audiences though - the BBC'S own output has taken away the music lovers' angle from Radio 1 with Radio 6 , and radio 1 Extra has removed the urban angle
11/04/2018, 13:39 - Rob;: All that's left is teenage slush

11/04/2018, 15:24 - Paul Dickinson: Unless sniffed through a cloud of steaming piss
11/04/2018, 15:55 - David;: Ha, amazing. Love that the froust has relics and an archaeology department
11/04/2018, 15:57 - Rob;: I still have the fat cigar butt you guys all smoked the night you got back from Norway and I had a free house. Don't know why.
11/04/2018, 15:58 - David;: We could put a very grotty, pissy exhibition together
11/04/2018, 16:02 - Rob;: The Froust Macabre
11/04/2018, 16:04 - Rob;: I also have the stag antlers from the night Sam was driving very aggressively past Dogellau police station
11/04/2018, 16:04 - Rob;: The night of the stairs fight
11/04/2018, 16:47 - Paul Dickinson: Little $5,500 tax return coming my way. Makes no sense
11/04/2018, 17:15 - David;: Zuckerderp embarassing himself
11/04/2018, 18:40 - Damian Rumble: It's what you get for voting trump. A tax rebate and war with Russia
11/04/2018, 19:05 - Rob;: Dave you forgot to add Stefan
11/04/2018, 19:05 - Rob;: He's furious
11/04/2018, 19:05 - Rob;: Who's an admin?

11/04/2018, 19:40 - David;: I don't have stefan's numver these days, that's why. I assumed everyone could edit
11/04/2018, 19:55 - Sam;: The big question is can anyone identify the female voice in James‚Äô video
11/04/2018, 19:57 - Paul Dickinson: That‚Äôs at Emily Parker‚Äôs
11/04/2018, 19:57 - Paul Dickinson: So probably hers. Mystery solved next
11/04/2018, 20:17 - Sam;: Not necessarily..

11/04/2018, 21:09 - David;: Put away the moon
11/04/2018, 21:17 - Sam;: Unbelievable. Bale getting taken off at half time as well... oh dear
11/04/2018, 21:19 - David;: These particular semi-finals
11/04/2018, 21:31 - David;: *quarters
11/04/2018, 21:31 - David;: A black swan event. The odds you would have got on an accumulator.
11/04/2018, 21:36 - Paul Dickinson: If Real Madrid score fans shouldn‚Äôt even cheer. Should have won anyway
11/04/2018, 21:37 - Rob;: Cunts
11/04/2018, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: Buffon's lost it
11/04/2018, 21:42 - Rob;: Ronaldo is such a fucking cunny
11/04/2018, 21:42 - Paul Dickinson: Assume there was no cheering?
11/04/2018, 21:43 - David;: What a massive tosser
11/04/2018, 21:43 - Rob;: None at all
11/04/2018, 21:43 - Paul Dickinson: >cunny
11/04/2018, 21:44 - Paul Dickinson: The GOAT
11/04/2018, 21:45 - Jack G;: Giant overzealous arrogant twat?
11/04/2018, 21:46 - David;: Like a library in there
11/04/2018, 21:53 - David;: Was that a sly reference to trump jack?
11/04/2018, 21:54 - Jack G;: Can easily be applied to him as well yeah. Although he‚Äôs probably here giant and assume it was a compliment
11/04/2018, 21:54 - Jack G;: He‚Äôs
11/04/2018, 21:54 - Jack G;: He‚Äôd
11/04/2018, 21:55 - David;: Nah i meant his tweet this afternoon - where he ended it with 'stop the arms race?' After having a massive go at Russia. Weird time to use a question mark.
11/04/2018, 21:55 - David;: Thought you might have been riffing on that
11/04/2018, 21:56 - Jack G;: Nah was just a play on the GOAT acronym
11/04/2018, 21:57 - Rob;: Parketry
11/04/2018, 21:57 - Rob;: Parquetry?
11/04/2018, 21:57 - Rob;: Parquetry.
12/04/2018, 22:07 - Rob;: Danny threatening to get himself on that plane
12/04/2018, 22:09 - David;: Trent has to at least be at the airport now?
12/04/2018, 22:12 - Rob;: He's squinting at the board to see what check-in gate he needs yeah
12/04/2018, 22:18 - Rob;: Salzburg destroying Lazio is pretty impressive
12/04/2018, 22:19 - Rob;: Lazio are above Roma and the Milan teams in Serie A
12/04/2018, 22:19 - David;: 4-1 is such a dangerous scoreli e
12/04/2018, 22:45 - Rob;: Seemingly national teams prepare for the World Cup by playing friendlies against countries that neighbour teams in their group, because apparently teams that are geographically near each other must play the same  brand of football as their rivals. Quite interesting
12/04/2018, 22:46 - Rob;: Explained here https://twitter.com/zonal_marking/status/976091223877439488?lang=en
12/04/2018, 22:54 - Phill: Trent is that cunt who is at the front of the check in desk sitting gumping a bag of nuts as you find your seats
13/04/2018, 09:50 - Rob;: What the people being this health warning haven't realised is that losing 6 months from your 80s sounds like a great tradeoff for 10 alcoholic drinks a week
13/04/2018, 09:50 - Rob;: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

Just one alcoholic drink a day could shorten your life, study says - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-43738644
13/04/2018, 09:51 - David;: Is there a causal mechanism identified or is it just correlative?
13/04/2018, 09:53 - David;: Because there's clearly so many other lifestyle factors which would correlate to drinking it's difficult to isolate - diet, excercise, class etc.
13/04/2018, 09:54 - / James Ball: Not to mention the "1 drink a day" will be averaged from those questionnaires: how much do you drink - per week between 6 and 10 drinks
13/04/2018, 09:56 - Phill: I'd rather die at 65 than never booze again
13/04/2018, 09:56 - David;: Yes, true. So no way to distinguish binging from a glass of red a day
13/04/2018, 10:03 - Rob;: Also the articles are stripped of any details about how they did the study, apartment from it being by Cambridge and covering 600,000 people
13/04/2018, 10:04 - Rob;: The positive thing is that the high average lifespan in Britain already factors in all the boozing we've been doing
13/04/2018, 10:06 - / James Ball: Not even a link to the study?
13/04/2018, 10:06 - David;: Or, is it because of all the boozing? Using their logic third world countries have a lower life span and drink less, hence they must have a lower lifespan because theu drink less
13/04/2018, 10:08 - David;: So 'booze for starving africans' is the real story here
13/04/2018, 10:09 - Rob;: I think it's probably the reporting of the study rather than the study itself that's off
13/04/2018, 10:10 - David;: Yeah i'm sure that's true - you just see it in lazy health journalism so much.
13/04/2018, 10:14 - Rob;: And the press release culture - there are so many grubby little websites that exist on traffic and people who repackage very methodical contributions to the body of knowledge into press releases with dramatic and basically untrue headlines. When I did that stint at I fucking love science we rejected so much bullshit. And that's a clickbait website doing that.
14/04/2018, 09:34 - Rob;: I bought my friend an elephant for his room
14/04/2018, 09:35 - Rob;: He text me thanks. I text back "don't mention it"
14/04/2018, 11:23 - David;: Hib
14/04/2018, 11:25 - Rob;: How have people handled he double gameweek?
14/04/2018, 11:25 - Rob;: It's the absolute perfect one for the free hit
14/04/2018, 11:25 - Rob;: Guessing you've done that Dave?
14/04/2018, 11:26 - David;: Nope, i have bigger things planned for my free hit
14/04/2018, 11:26 - Rob;: I haven't done my wildcard, it will just fuck me over for next week
14/04/2018, 11:26 - Rob;: Tripple capatain deployed
14/04/2018, 11:26 - David;: Just transferred in max players on doubles.its possible to field and still get an XI next week
14/04/2018, 11:27 - David;: Yeah i TCed as well - Hazard
14/04/2018, 11:28 - Rob;: Yeah I've been transferring in douel gameweekers for the last month or so, will have two free transfer next week so can just about d an 11. Burnley are lifesavers by playing both weeks
14/04/2018, 11:28 - David;: Would have liked sanchez, worried about what he could do, but couldnt afford
14/04/2018, 11:28 - Rob;: I have tripple captained Kane
14/04/2018, 11:28 - David;: Yeah, so 3 burnley players is a no brainer
14/04/2018, 11:29 - Rob;: Very annoying one of the ones I had already got injured
14/04/2018, 11:30 - David;: Fools selling salah - they will just have to get him back with a huge price hit
14/04/2018, 11:38 - David;: <Media omitted>
14/04/2018, 11:39 - David;: This - firstly, the double double barrel; secondly the way they've put wilson and defoe on different sides

15/04/2018, 08:48 - Phill: Had a dream last night I had to carry round my shit in a Tupperware box everywhere I went
15/04/2018, 08:49 - Phill: The box would expand and the lid would pop off as the shit produced gas
15/04/2018, 12:04 - Rob;: I'm sure Tupperware would be proud that their brand is so pervasive as to be named directly in that dream

16/04/2018, 22:30 - Sam;: The Christmas party at savile. Savile owing him 50 quid. The George best story. It rights itself

17/04/2018, 20:51 - Rob;: On the thread days ago mate
17/04/2018, 22:29 - David;: Cunk on Britain
17/04/2018, 22:29 - David;: They've given her a full prime time series
17/04/2018, 22:31 - / James Ball: Is it any good
17/04/2018, 22:31 - David;: It's got good moments, but a type of humour i'm not sure you can enjoy for 30 minutes undilluted
17/04/2018, 22:37 - Rob;: I've enjoyed both episodes a lot
17/04/2018, 23:28 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/04/2018, 23:29 - David;: üëç
18/04/2018, 00:29 - Damian Rumble: David I believe you still haven't added Stefan to this thread
18/04/2018, 08:01 - David; added Stefan;
18/04/2018, 01:11 - David;: I don't have his number.
18/04/2018, 07:49 - Rob;: > Stefan +44 7752 458076
18/04/2018, 07:50 - Rob;: There it is again for you
18/04/2018, 16:30 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
19/04/2018, 12:37 - Paul Dickinson: Can everyone submit their fantasy football history. Need to run an audit
19/04/2018, 12:37 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
19/04/2018, 12:37 - Phill: Too hot to do it.
19/04/2018, 12:40 - Rob;: Phil you're sadly irrelevant anyway
19/04/2018, 12:40 - Phill: Like arsenal
19/04/2018, 12:40 - Hamish Sinclair: I assume I'm also irrelevant here
19/04/2018, 12:41 - Rob;: No you're a winner
19/04/2018, 12:41 - Rob;: According to the trophy which we've realised is wrong
19/04/2018, 12:43 - Phill: How's it possible for the trophy to be wrong? Did the engravers troll?
19/04/2018, 12:46 - Rob;: We never actually checked it, just pieced it together from memory
19/04/2018, 12:46 - Rob;: We need to redo the trophy anyway as there isn't really room for people winning it 3+ times
19/04/2018, 12:47 - Hamish Sinclair: What was wrong about it? Did damos victory never happen?
19/04/2018, 12:47 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
19/04/2018, 12:48 - Rob;: Paul's is listed as the wrong year we think
19/04/2018, 12:48 - Phill: Who is we?
19/04/2018, 12:48 - Rob;: Me and Dave
19/04/2018, 12:48 - Phill: Who currently holds the trophy?
19/04/2018, 12:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Just  checked my points, still beating jack
19/04/2018, 12:49 - Rob;: We were having a chat about updating it the other day and couldn't remember who had won since I first got it done
19/04/2018, 12:49 - Rob;: I have it currently
19/04/2018, 12:49 - Phill: Can we get a mounted dildo as the new trophy?
19/04/2018, 12:49 - David;: We need to re-do the plaque
19/04/2018, 12:51 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/04/2018, 12:51 - David;: This is mine
19/04/2018, 12:52 - Rob;: If we all post them we can graph the data
19/04/2018, 12:52 - Rob;: Look at meta trends
19/04/2018, 12:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Dave your 2012/2013 season was mental
19/04/2018, 12:53 - Phill: Top 5000 world
19/04/2018, 12:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Where do we find this data?
19/04/2018, 12:53 - Phill: üåö
19/04/2018, 12:54 - David;: Yeah yeah, big season
19/04/2018, 12:54 - David;: Go to gameweek history
19/04/2018, 12:55 - David;: At the bottom of the points for each week this season there is a total for your old seasons
19/04/2018, 12:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Maybe not do able on the app
19/04/2018, 12:56 - Rob;: Yeah it's only on the browser version
19/04/2018, 12:57 - David;: Hamish is becoming like the liverpool of fantasy football - a glorious history but hasn't challenged for the title recently
19/04/2018, 12:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Next season will be my year
19/04/2018, 13:00 - David;: Paul did you only start playing in 10/11? That seems mental
19/04/2018, 13:00 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah. When Santa Cruz was at Blackburn I think
19/04/2018, 13:01 - Paul Dickinson: Or whomever it was he played for
19/04/2018, 13:08 - Phill: The catalyst
19/04/2018, 13:08 - Phill: The inspiration
19/04/2018, 13:08 - Phill: Roque santa Cruz
19/04/2018, 13:16 - David;: 'I admire him so much i need to track his season through some sort of points-based system'
19/04/2018, 13:18 - Phill: How I stopped worrying and learned to love Roque Santa Cruz
19/04/2018, 13:18 - Phill: Dr Dickinson
19/04/2018, 13:19 - David;: Didnt he go to city and flop massively?
19/04/2018, 13:19 - David;: During the robinho years
19/04/2018, 13:20 - Phill: Correct
19/04/2018, 13:26 - David;: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009‚Äì10_Manchester_City_F.C._season
19/04/2018, 13:26 - David;: The dross in the city squad back then
19/04/2018, 13:26 - David;: >benjani
19/04/2018, 13:42 - David;: Damo how hard are you for TESS? Is it going to do anything new really?
19/04/2018, 15:31 - Paul Dickinson: What‚Äôs the correct final order in ff?
19/04/2018, 15:34 - Rob;: We need Damo and Hamish's records
19/04/2018, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Will send tonight when with computer
19/04/2018, 19:03 - Damian Rumble: Pretty confident my win was the 2010/11 season
19/04/2018, 20:10 - David;: Dale Winton - it's not quite Bowie is it? I feel the country is strong enough to bear this loss
19/04/2018, 20:19 - / James Ball: Rumour has it he died in his sweep
20/04/2018, 09:56 - Phill: Wenger out Wenger out Wenger out
20/04/2018, 09:59 - Damian Rumble: Rob do you remember a time when  arsenal wasn't run by Wenger?
20/04/2018, 09:59 - Rob;: Only just
20/04/2018, 10:00 - Rob;: I remember Bruce Rioch buying Dennis Bergkamp and that's it
20/04/2018, 10:00 - David;: Wow, didn't think they would announce it now
20/04/2018, 10:04 - Damian Rumble: Wengixt
20/04/2018, 10:05 - Rob;: It is very strange timing
20/04/2018, 10:05 - Rob;: Perhaps season ticket renewals have been slow
20/04/2018, 10:05 - David;: Surely all this can achieve is undermining thr europa league run?
20/04/2018, 10:05 - Rob;: Hard to say
20/04/2018, 10:06 - Phill: Or a final hurrah
20/04/2018, 10:06 - David;: Classic arsenal - only changes when the accountants get furious.
20/04/2018, 10:06 - Rob;: A definite stay/go decision is certainly better than the will he/won't he thing we've had the last few seasons
20/04/2018, 10:07 - Phill: Maybe it's so that when atletico come the the Emirates, simeone   signs a contract
20/04/2018, 10:07 - Rob;: Would like that
20/04/2018, 10:07 - Rob;: There was a rumour earlier in the year that Ancelotti as a short term thing was sorted
20/04/2018, 10:08 - Phill: Get him on board before Chelsea sack Cunte and hijack simeone and ruin him
20/04/2018, 10:08 - David;: Yeah chelsea are a bit fucked. Their squad is broken and they've worked through all viable available managers
20/04/2018, 10:35 - David;: <Media omitted>
20/04/2018, 10:35 - David;: Official Collated Scores
20/04/2018, 10:35 - Rob;: A word doc, in 2018
20/04/2018, 10:36 - David;: Lol - everyone uses word docs still
20/04/2018, 10:36 - David;: Apart from cunts
20/04/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: Not amongst friends
20/04/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: Google docs mate
20/04/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: Embrace simultaneous editing
20/04/2018, 10:37 - David;: Well yeah I often use them.
20/04/2018, 10:37 - David;: But did this need to be edited?
20/04/2018, 10:37 - David;: At most it needs updating once a year
20/04/2018, 10:37 - Rob;: I made a Google sheet with the intention of getting deep into graphs
20/04/2018, 10:37 - Rob;: Very deep
20/04/2018, 10:38 - David;: Yeah that's fine, just input the data from here into that
20/04/2018, 10:39 - David;: I was thinking of a spreadsheet but I needed to e.g. import all the screenshots first and I wanted to just have that list of seasons at the top
20/04/2018, 10:39 - David;: Would be good to get the data from Phil and Jack to complete. e.g. ranks each year, moving averages.
20/04/2018, 10:40 - David;: (and Hamish)
20/04/2018, 10:40 - David;: What's better to get engraved - just surnames, or first name initial too?
20/04/2018, 10:42 - Rob;: Surname would be fine
20/04/2018, 10:42 - Rob;: Rather footballesque
20/04/2018, 11:08 - Damian Rumble: Word... Didn't realise we were back at school
20/04/2018, 11:08 - / James Ball: I challenge you to use Google Docs with no internet connection
20/04/2018, 11:08 - Phill: Lol who the fuck doesn't use word still
20/04/2018, 11:09 - Phill: Google docs is wank
20/04/2018, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: Lol
20/04/2018, 11:10 - Phill: >trusting the cloud
20/04/2018, 11:10 - Damian Rumble: > word
20/04/2018, 11:10 - Phill: Il use it once it's on a blockchain foundation
20/04/2018, 11:11 - Phill: >being so edgy that you shun word
20/04/2018, 11:12 - Rob;: Offline Google docs are fine
20/04/2018, 11:12 - Rob;: Not prepared to pay a subscription to use Office  outside of work when I barely need it
20/04/2018, 11:13 - Phill: >not nicking a key from work
20/04/2018, 11:13 - / James Ball: Yeah tbh I don't have word
20/04/2018, 11:13 - Damian Rumble: > not realising that being able to collaborate with a g doc on any internet connected device is superior to downloading a hefty word document that only I can see, whilst pushing for it
20/04/2018, 11:13 - Damian Rumble: *paying
20/04/2018, 11:13 - Rob;: Pushing for it
20/04/2018, 11:13 - Rob;: So hard
20/04/2018, 11:13 - / James Ball: Push Damo
20/04/2018, 11:14 - / James Ball: I can see the head
20/04/2018, 11:15 - Sam;: Fuck you Karen, I pushed for that document
20/04/2018, 11:15 - Phill: >relying on the internet and trustinf Google to keep your documents secure. 0/10 would not push.
20/04/2018, 11:22 - Rob;: But trusting Microsoft more
20/04/2018, 11:23 - Rob;: You're deep in silicone valley whatever you do
20/04/2018, 11:23 - Rob;: Keeping physical journals is the only way out
20/04/2018, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
20/04/2018, 11:26 - Phill: I don't trust Microsoft to look after the documents if they're stored on my hard drive
20/04/2018, 11:26 - Phill: Whereas Google docs is cloud
20/04/2018, 11:28 - Rob;: You can set Google docs to save onto your harddrive - all of mine are available offline on all my devices
20/04/2018, 11:31 - / James Ball: But you can't view or edit them offline? Or do you have to use Chrome?
20/04/2018, 11:32 - Rob;: You can download the app and work on stuff offline, then it updates it in all other places once you're on wifi
20/04/2018, 12:03 - David;: >this being framed as a mutually exclusive commitment
20/04/2018, 12:03 - David;: >the formatting issues that emerge from tranferring google docs to word
20/04/2018, 12:05 - David;: >not being in a professional context where word doc manuscripts are acceptable but a google doc will get you laughed out of the room
20/04/2018, 12:06 - David;: >not having access to an office key
20/04/2018, 12:08 - Rob;: Word is nothing to ms

20/04/2018, 12:26 - Damian Rumble: Personally I prefer to write all my documents on a cave wall in a paste made from ground up insects. No way Zuckerberg can get at my data there!
20/04/2018, 12:28 - David;: So when you were submitting articles to physics journals did you share a google doc with them?
20/04/2018, 12:28 - Damian Rumble: Did it LaTeX mate
20/04/2018, 12:29 - David;: Oh, interesting - so a locally saved file?
20/04/2018, 12:29 - Rob;: Word does actually offer cloud storage via OneDrive
20/04/2018, 12:29 - Damian Rumble: You send them the raw code and three attached images and then they compile it locally
20/04/2018, 12:29 - David;: OneDrive is cancer
20/04/2018, 12:30 - Rob;: My original point is that for non-work I would never use a word doc these days. Definitely do use it at work all the time
20/04/2018, 12:30 - David;: Ah, interesting - so absolutely not sending them a google doc then?
20/04/2018, 13:49 - Damian Rumble: I'm not aware that Google have a LaTeX equivalent. So no I would not be sending a Google Doc.
20/04/2018, 13:49 - Phill: What do you use at work damo?
20/04/2018, 13:50 - Damian Rumble: Mainly jupyter note book,
Dataiku and PowerPoint
20/04/2018, 13:52 - Phill: To write reports
20/04/2018, 13:52 - Phill: Not scientific software
20/04/2018, 13:53 - Phill: I could start listing random software, but all reports are still written, and distributed, in word
20/04/2018, 13:53 - Damian Rumble: We don't do reports
20/04/2018, 13:53 - / James Ball: The problem is there is a monopoly on word processors by Microsoft
20/04/2018, 13:54 - Phill: >we don't do reports
20/04/2018, 13:54 - Damian Rumble: We publish stuff in PowerPoint
20/04/2018, 13:54 - Phill: And let people work out for themselves what it means?
20/04/2018, 13:54 - Phill: I have to do reports for every fucking computational change I make to anything. To live in a world without reports. I'm jelly.
20/04/2018, 13:56 - Damian Rumble: We're supposed to be AGILE which means no documentation
20/04/2018, 13:56 - / James Ball: Clear out as soon as the inspectors come in leaving no evidence
20/04/2018, 13:56 - Damian Rumble: Everything is delivered as a oral presentation
20/04/2018, 13:56 - Phill: Ok so how do you do an audit trail when something goes wrong?
20/04/2018, 13:57 - Phill: Lol fucking insurance company scam city get fucked ho
20/04/2018, 13:57 - / James Ball: Damian the thought of you orally presenting to someone is terrifying
20/04/2018, 13:57 - Paul Dickinson: ‚ÄúMerrrrlllll‚Äù
20/04/2018, 13:58 - Phill: Brb while I tell everyone I know not to insure with aviva because they're probably not keeping track of anything
20/04/2018, 14:02 - Paul Dickinson: >having insurance
20/04/2018, 14:03 - Damian Rumble: James - actually presentation is probably the part of the job that I'm best at!
20/04/2018, 14:07 - David;: Its this musk bullshit 'just walk out of meetings whenever you feel like it'
20/04/2018, 14:38 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
20/04/2018, 14:39 - David;: Lol those legs
20/04/2018, 14:40 - David;: Like a quentin blake illustration
20/04/2018, 14:41 - / James Ball: They don't look weight bearing
20/04/2018, 14:41 - / James Ball: Like they could be snapped by a school girl
20/04/2018, 17:09 - Sam;: Surely luis Enrique or even tuchel over Simeone for arsenal?
20/04/2018, 17:12 - Rob;: Tuchel is nailed on for PSG it seems
20/04/2018, 17:12 - Phill: King Brenny. No question. gOAT.
20/04/2018, 17:12 - Rob;: I literally don't remember having new manager speculation. It's quite exciting
20/04/2018, 17:13 - Rob;: Brendon. The carp.
20/04/2018, 17:13 - Paul Dickinson: Everyone overlooking they won‚Äôt be allowed to spend any money anyway
20/04/2018, 17:13 - Paul Dickinson: They‚Äôll get an accountant in
20/04/2018, 17:15 - Phill: Tuchel has won the same amount of trophies as David Moyes
20/04/2018, 17:16 - Phill: <Media omitted>
20/04/2018, 17:17 - Rob;: I'm glad there isn't some mini french Wenger to be the chosen one ala Moyes and Fergie
20/04/2018, 17:20 - Phill: Simeone seems to know how to  take a team from perrenial underachievement to glory

20/04/2018, 17:24 - Rob;: If they're going
20/04/2018, 17:27 - David;: How much will the squad be decimated post-Wenger?
20/04/2018, 17:29 - Sam;: You answered your own question
20/04/2018, 17:29 - Sam;: By a tenth
20/04/2018, 17:29 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
20/04/2018, 17:29 - David;: Fair point. Will they even know what life is? All they've ever known is Wenger.
20/04/2018, 17:29 - Rob;: Hib
20/04/2018, 17:30 - Rob;: I am looking forward to someone else's assessment of the squad
20/04/2018, 17:30 - David;: Ozil definitely has no idea what life is at this point?
20/04/2018, 17:31 - Sam;: He could you some of the ¬£300k a week to find out
20/04/2018, 17:31 - Rob;: Whoever comes in needs to be very good at bollocking. I've never know a group of grown men who needed such a bollocking
20/04/2018, 17:32 - Rob;: Xhaka. That's a bollocking
20/04/2018, 17:32 - Sam;: They don‚Äôt they‚Äôre born do they. They will be shocked to find out they are born
20/04/2018, 17:32 - David;: Yeah you really just need a shouting man, someone with a huge gob on him, more gob than face
20/04/2018, 17:33 - Sam;: Sammy lee then?
20/04/2018, 17:33 - David;: And who is prepared to use that gob relentlessly
20/04/2018, 17:33 - Rob;: Perfect

20/04/2018, 19:40 - / James Ball: So I've just found out that the little village I live in has both a microbrewery and a micro-ciderpress both of which have bars open on the weekend...
20/04/2018, 19:46 - Paul Dickinson: What‚Äôs the village?
20/04/2018, 19:46 - / James Ball: Mitcheldean
20/04/2018, 19:51 - Paul Dickinson: What‚Äôs the population?
20/04/2018, 19:51 - / James Ball: 2400 I think
20/04/2018, 19:51 - Paul Dickinson: And near to Phil‚Äôs yeah?
20/04/2018, 19:58 - Phill: Yeah, I'm actually going to party in mitcheldean tomorrow night
20/04/2018, 20:02 - / James Ball: At someone's house?
20/04/2018, 20:03 - Phill: Not sure it's Becca's friends 30th, finishes at like 10:30. Not a mad one. Driving so no boozing.
20/04/2018, 20:04 - / James Ball: Might be in the brewery then, that closes at 11
20/04/2018, 20:05 - / James Ball: I live right in the middle near the church
20/04/2018, 20:05 - Phill: Do you live in a house share?

20/04/2018, 20:05 - Phill: üëçüèæ

20/04/2018, 21:47 - Phill: Grow up damo
20/04/2018, 21:56 - David;: What does head of football relations mean?
20/04/2018, 21:58 - David;: How is it different from gead of negotiations? And how is that different from head of recruitment? Arsenal management structure makes no fucking sense.
20/04/2018, 22:03 - Rob;: It's just that director of football role most clubs have
20/04/2018, 22:04 - David;: 'Football relations'
20/04/2018, 22:05 - David;: Surely to recruit you have to negotiate - recruitment is negotiation? Or is head of recruitment scouting and negotiations is making the actual deals?
20/04/2018, 22:05 - Rob;: Recruitment is scouting, director of football is making long term decisions about the club on a sporting basis, which includes transfer negotiation. Basically what David Dean did for us, which Wenger then took hold of
20/04/2018, 22:06 - David;: So what is head of negotiations then!?
20/04/2018, 22:06 - David;: Just general negotiations. Ask if he wants a tea and he will negotiate you up to a bagel and coffee?
20/04/2018, 22:07 - Rob;: I think they work undert the director of football to do the legwork of getting a deal done
20/04/2018, 22:07 - Rob;: What Dick Law did for us previously
20/04/2018, 22:07 - David;: A real cunt to have around - just always negotiating about everything
20/04/2018, 22:08 - David;: 'But Huss i'm just paying you that fiver back for the pint, i can't give you any more equity'
21/04/2018, 17:37 - David;: Is ashley young just a bit shit and no one's been noticing?
21/04/2018, 17:42 - Phill: "that's a yellow and a half...ha.ha.hehe"

21/04/2018, 17:47 - Phill: Is it from wine bear?
21/04/2018, 17:47 - David;: carnanere grape which i've not had before. Juicy as fuck, like if merlot wasnt shit
21/04/2018, 17:48 - David;: Nah from leamington
21/04/2018, 17:48 - Phill: You back up there now?
21/04/2018, 17:49 - David;: Just sorting some stuff out over the weekend, getting my car started and planting up the allotment.
21/04/2018, 17:50 - Phill: üå∂
21/04/2018, 17:50 - Phill: I've done the same
21/04/2018, 17:50 - David;: I found a bag of 2cb acid dmt and mescaline left from wales lol. Might drop some acid of an evening
21/04/2018, 17:50 - Phill: Butternut squash, courgette, carrots, rhubarb, lettuce all planted
21/04/2018, 17:51 - Phill: Cheeky bit of acid
21/04/2018, 17:51 - David;: Decent - i got the courgettes and broad beans out today
21/04/2018, 17:51 - Phill: Drop it before the Liverpool game
21/04/2018, 17:51 - David;: Potatoes and sweet corn tomorrow
21/04/2018, 17:52 - David;: How was the butternut to germinate - is it basically like pumpkin?
21/04/2018, 17:52 - David;: Do you need a greenhouse for it?
21/04/2018, 17:52 - Phill: Yeah was fine. Like pumpkin. Took a while in the trays
21/04/2018, 17:52 - Phill: Not that I'm aware of
21/04/2018, 17:52 - Phill: They're all just in the ground
21/04/2018, 17:52 - Phill: Outside
21/04/2018, 17:53 - David;: Do you still have that weed plant?
21/04/2018, 17:54 - Damian Rumble: I highly doubt that acid will still be good. Don't get your hopes up
21/04/2018, 17:55 - Damian Rumble: Though you should definitely get the mescaline out
21/04/2018, 17:59 - David;: Would it degrade that rapidly?
21/04/2018, 18:00 - David;: I dont want to go mental anyway.
21/04/2018, 18:00 - Damian Rumble: It's more that it's quite volatile. If it's been in somewhere dark then will have lasted better
21/04/2018, 18:01 - David;: Yeah it has.
21/04/2018, 18:01 - David;: I'm going to try half a blotter
21/04/2018, 18:01 - Paul Dickinson: Half a blooter
21/04/2018, 18:02 - David;: Get blot, get bloot
21/04/2018, 18:15 - Phill: >do I still have the weed plant
21/04/2018, 18:15 - Phill: >not harvesting 2 ounces and smoking through it in 2 months
21/04/2018, 18:16 - Phill: Going to plant another I think though
21/04/2018, 18:18 - Damian Rumble: I'd probably take the whole tab. Better to be safe than sorry
21/04/2018, 18:19 - Sam;: Better to be bloot than noot
21/04/2018, 18:22 - Rob;: Yeah don't tragically underdose, Dave
21/04/2018, 18:23 - Phill: Honk the dmt
21/04/2018, 20:43 - David;: The acid is still üëå
21/04/2018, 20:44 - David;: Half a blotter perfect dose. Floaty without madness.
21/04/2018, 20:44 - Damian Rumble: That's encouraging
21/04/2018, 20:45 - David;: Thinking of going to see isle of dogs, that could be a game changer
21/04/2018, 20:45 - David;: I just think it doesnt break down that quickly if it is stored away
21/04/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: As in right now?
21/04/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: That would be a cool idea
21/04/2018, 20:46 - David;: Yeah yeah - the stop time animation
21/04/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: Talking dogs. Acid. A dark room. What could go wrong?
21/04/2018, 20:47 - David;: I cant see any problems with talking animated dogs surrounded by lots of people
21/04/2018, 20:52 - Rob;: It's quite an unsettling film tbh
21/04/2018, 20:52 - Rob;: Set in a post apocalyptic (for dogs) rubbish dump with huge periods of silence
21/04/2018, 20:53 - David;: Well its not on in leam anyway apparently. Will have to see ready player one.

22/04/2018, 13:00 - Rob;: I went on a self portraiture sculpture course course with Emily Thornbury. She made a right tit of herself
22/04/2018, 14:03 - David;: üëç
22/04/2018, 14:05 - David;: Does anyone else think that Danny Ings celebrating his goal against west brom resembles that bit in the shining where jack nicholson is bursting through the door with an axe?
22/04/2018, 14:05 - David;: Very unhinged vibe

"He's going to be 69 in December but he's extraordinarily fit. He is the same weight as when I met him - 75 kilos."
23/04/2018, 20:29 - Rob;: Quite creepy, David.

23/04/2018, 21:01 - Damian Rumble: I'm pretty sure I've been 75 kilos for the last 15 years. Doesn't seem that big of an achievement

24/04/2018, 13:55 - Rob;: I quite often get lunch from a place called Siam Eatery, which seems outdated on two fronts
24/04/2018, 13:56 - Rob;: Conversely Chippy's Peking Inn changed its name to the Beijing Gourmet, about 50 years after the event
24/04/2018, 13:56 - Rob;: Which must itself have been before the Peking Inn opened
24/04/2018, 14:08 - David;: Were you eating there? No, i was only Peking Inn
24/04/2018, 15:32 - Rob;: The larger agency I work for is full of marketing style gimmicks to improve office culture, with the magazine sitting within that as a sort of sarcastic, cynical journalist enclave that wants no part in any of it
24/04/2018, 15:33 - Rob;: They've started an 'appreciation box', in which you can nominate a colleague and have your message read out at the next 'huddle'. I kid you not.
24/04/2018, 15:33 - Rob;: I've spent quite a lot of my afternoon filling the box with fake nominations

The lofty tree of Cedar Communications would shrivel, die, be earmarked for removal by the council, then end up as lowly wood chippings on the cold earth of brand marketing without him. He‚Äôs the pre-alcoholism Ant to Cedar‚Äôs Dec. The undead Ronnie Corbett to our undead Ronnie Barker. The sparkly boob tube to our unfortunate muffin top.

24/04/2018, 15:37 - Rob;: I think only the few people organising it
24/04/2018, 15:38 - David;: Will it not just collapse under a perfect vacuum of apathy?
24/04/2018, 15:39 - Rob;: It would if the people organising weren't so important. The main instigater has transferred to the Hong Kong office so it might ebb away now
24/04/2018, 15:39 - David;: But no one else participating? It would just be them nomimating each other.
24/04/2018, 15:40 - David;: 'Important' - no one who has time to think about something that shit is important to anything
24/04/2018, 15:41 - Rob;: The nomination thing has been mildly successful before - bosses thanking their team etc
24/04/2018, 15:41 - Rob;: Account Managers have the time because they're cunts and it's barely a real job

24/04/2018, 19:27 - Rob;: Weirdly it's sort of rinsed us, and the European clubs put the price up when British clubs come a knocking
24/04/2018, 19:27 - Rob;: Also, the quality of player shit teams have these days is insane

24/04/2018, 21:19 - Paul Dickinson: This has got black swan event written all over it
24/04/2018, 21:20 - Paul Dickinson: For the 2nd leg
24/04/2018, 21:24 - Rob;: Tie over. Liverpool out.
24/04/2018, 21:24 - Phill: May as well be 5-4
24/04/2018, 21:25 - Paul Dickinson: 5-0 is the new 1-0
24/04/2018, 21:26 - Paul Dickinson: Ah so it begins
24/04/2018, 21:29 - Paul Dickinson: Yep all over now
24/04/2018, 21:30 - Rob;: By our earlier logic isn't this actually now less dangerous for Liverpool
24/04/2018, 21:31 - Paul Dickinson: No, I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a Phil bet underpinning it somewhere. He must have said something whilst watching
24/04/2018, 21:32 - Phill: Starting organising a trip to watch the on about 70 mins
24/04/2018, 21:32 - Phill: Watch the final*
24/04/2018, 21:39 - Paul Dickinson: So is this a good result or actually they may as well have just lost?
24/04/2018, 21:39 - Phill: It's a good result.
24/04/2018, 21:39 - Phill: 5-2 you fucking joking?
24/04/2018, 21:39 - Jack G;: Well Roma came back from a worse position to knock out Barcelona
24/04/2018, 21:40 - Paul Dickinson: Football is broken though
24/04/2018, 21:40 - Paul Dickinson: So 5-2 is nothing
24/04/2018, 21:40 - Rob;: It's somewhere between just winning 2-0 or 3-0 in goodness
24/04/2018, 21:42 - Damian Rumble: Liverpool are basically the Tories at the last election. Smashing it throughout and some how managing to almost lose it at the final hurdle.
24/04/2018, 21:43 - Rob;: Winning by three goals isn't really almost losing
24/04/2018, 21:43 - Rob;: Very much winning by three times the average margin

26/04/2018, 19:38 - Stefan;: Might have to go up a day later so I can egg his limo
26/04/2018, 20:13 - David;: Arsenal appear to be honking
26/04/2018, 20:16 - Paul Dickinson: Honking to a 0-0
26/04/2018, 20:17 - David;: Early red card though
26/04/2018, 20:17 - David;: Guy got 2 yellows within 10 mins.
26/04/2018, 20:17 - David;: Amd unsustainable rate
26/04/2018, 20:18 - Paul Dickinson: Ah yes vrasljko
26/04/2018, 20:18 - David;: Had a mad one
26/04/2018, 20:18 - David;: Simeone the chimp has now been sent off as well
26/04/2018, 21:22 - Paul Dickinson: Arse still honking?
26/04/2018, 21:22 - David;: They seem to have stopped honking
26/04/2018, 21:23 - David;: Barely even tonking
26/04/2018, 21:24 - David;: Ah - honking again
26/04/2018, 21:24 - David;: Just scored
26/04/2018, 21:24 - David;: He does Lacazette though
26/04/2018, 21:45 - David;: Ah - 1-1
26/04/2018, 22:18 - Rob;: Sounds strange but i feel the sending off rather played into Atheluco's hands
26/04/2018, 22:19 - David;: Yeah i thought the same thing. You were playing better before the card and it allowed them to play purely defensively
26/04/2018, 22:19 - Rob;: Reinforced the strategy of sitting tight and hoping to nick an away goal
26/04/2018, 22:20 - Rob;: I couldn't see from where I was, but was it a penalty on Lacazette in the first half?
26/04/2018, 22:20 - Rob;: We were baying for it. Honking.
26/04/2018, 22:20 - Rob;: Simione Mobile Disco
26/04/2018, 22:24 - David;: Nah would have been very soft
26/04/2018, 22:25 - David;: Fell over under very slight pressure
26/04/2018, 22:25 - David;: It was definitely a second yellow though
26/04/2018, 22:25 - Rob;: But we were frothing at the mouth for it
26/04/2018, 22:25 - Paul Dickinson: Honking
26/04/2018, 22:26 - Rob;: I had my shitty plastic flag out tonking for it
26/04/2018, 22:26 - David;: Ah, well in that case - why did't you say?
26/04/2018, 22:26 - Paul Dickinson: Your shitty plastic flag
26/04/2018, 22:26 - Paul Dickinson: ?
26/04/2018, 22:26 - David;: Smeared in shit - classic football memorabilia
26/04/2018, 22:27 - Rob;: They smeared 60,000 flags in shit and left them on every seat
26/04/2018, 22:27 - David;: Lol, that would create a unique atmosphere though - that's undeniable
26/04/2018, 22:28 - Paul Dickinson: Would you rather have everything in your home covered in shit all the time inexplicably but you immediately become clean upon exiting or live your life knowing you will shit yourself once a day without warning. Could happen anywhere
26/04/2018, 22:29 - David;: Obvioysly the second
26/04/2018, 22:29 - Paul Dickinson: I was thinking first
26/04/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: Yeah clearly the second
26/04/2018, 22:29 - David;: Shitting yourself lsnt even that bad
26/04/2018, 22:29 - Paul Dickinson: Just have to make sure you don‚Äôt. Bring people over
26/04/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: But every surface is shitty?
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Paul Dickinson: You don‚Äôt want to become the person who shits themselves in meetings
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Paul Dickinson: Or at party‚Äôs
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Rob;: Pillows, bed sheets, inside and outside of glasses and bowls
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Rob;: Your showerhead and bath
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Rob;: That's no life
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah but only occurs inside your house
26/04/2018, 22:30 - David;: Better would be you are either smothered in shit everywhere outside your home but all clean inside - or every surface in your house is constantly eared in shit
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Paul Dickinson: Clean as a whistle once out
26/04/2018, 22:30 - Rob;: But that's where I live
26/04/2018, 22:31 - Paul Dickinson: In Dave‚Äôs one I‚Äôm going for shitty house
26/04/2018, 22:31 - Paul Dickinson: The shit house
26/04/2018, 22:31 - David;: Yeah, the house is your only refuge. There would be nowhere clean to fall back to and regroup
26/04/2018, 22:32 - Paul Dickinson: Rob you‚Äôre putting too many negatives on having a shifty house
26/04/2018, 22:32 - Rob;: And you'd have to live alone for the rest of your life
26/04/2018, 22:32 - Paul Dickinson: Embrace your shit house
26/04/2018, 22:32 - David;: I need the house unshitted
 That would be fine i just become a recluse and read book and do piece work remotely.
26/04/2018, 22:33 - Rob;: Could I just rent a tiny bedshit and do all my living in a rented living room?
26/04/2018, 22:32 - Paul Dickinson: Be thankful you‚Äôre not the shitty guy outside
26/04/2018, 22:33 - Rob;: So i only technically _live_ in one shitty room
26/04/2018, 22:33 - Rob;: But can shower, prepare food etc in shared spaces
26/04/2018, 22:34 - Paul Dickinson: Need clarification on this
26/04/2018, 22:36 - Rob;: So I rent the smallest room possible, which is where I live,. Don't even need a toilet of it's magically clean every time I leave, but then constantly rent an Airbnb nearby to prepare food, wash and watch TV in
26/04/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: This player profile of and interview with former Charlton player Derek Hayes is making me cry
26/04/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: *Hales

26/04/2018, 23:08 - Hamish Sinclair: I don't go to the cinema
26/04/2018, 23:09 - Rob;: Married yes to Carol
26/04/2018, 23:14 - Phill: Tolerating boring people

26/04/2018, 23:18 - Phill: <Media omitted>
26/04/2018, 23:20 - Phill: also, definitely randomly shitting yourself is superior to a shitty house
26/04/2018, 23:21 - Phill: >your food, covered in shit
26/04/2018, 23:21 - Phill: >your wife, shit
26/04/2018, 23:21 - Phill: >your toilet paper, shit. Wiping your shit with shit.
26/04/2018, 23:22 - Rob;: Good that we'll always be able to quote this out of context
26/04/2018, 23:22 - Phill: Paul are we talking loose slurry, or neat, tidy logs?
26/04/2018, 23:25 - Phill: Ate two jumbo sausages from Arctic fish bar the other night and almost shat myself on the way home the following morning.
26/04/2018, 23:26 - Phill: Waddled into the house with that shooty arse pain which signals imminent, urgent dumping
26/04/2018, 23:26 - Rob;: Fucking two
26/04/2018, 23:26 - Rob;: Longer than your oesophagus
26/04/2018, 23:29 - Paul Dickinson: Slurry definitely. A good smear
26/04/2018, 23:30 - Phill: So not ornamental shit
26/04/2018, 23:33 - Paul Dickinson: No this stuff is dripping everywhere
26/04/2018, 23:33 - Paul Dickinson: Including when shitting yourself
26/04/2018, 23:33 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôll ruin clothes etc
26/04/2018, 23:34 - Rob;: There's no situation where that would be good
26/04/2018, 23:34 - Rob;: Or preferable to shitting yourself
26/04/2018, 23:36 - Rob;: You'd just take the shit yourself option and get a job where you can work from home. Where a nappy until it happens each day then head out and enjoy yourself after. Or stay at home and enjoy your unshitted house.
26/04/2018, 23:36 - Phill: Nappy. Obviously.
26/04/2018, 23:50 - Paul Dickinson: >nappy
27/04/2018, 00:11 - Damian Rumble: For the record I agree with Paul
27/04/2018, 00:21 - David;: Lol just re-watched QT 'there's been sustained smearing in labour'

27/04/2018, 18:18 - David;: I ‚ù§ acid

27/04/2018, 18:19 - Phill: Kek

27/04/2018, 18:21 - Paul Dickinson: All the more for me
27/04/2018, 18:21 - Phill: Paul, does your coke dealer supply other supplements?
27/04/2018, 18:22 - David;: >smuggling hard drugs
27/04/2018, 18:22 - Phill: >not doing it for the buzz
27/04/2018, 18:22 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah lol let me just shelf this safely back into the uk
27/04/2018, 18:23 - Phill: Acid must be so easy to smuggle doe
27/04/2018, 18:23 - Phill: Artist mate
27/04/2018, 18:23 - Phill: My paper mate
27/04/2018, 18:23 - Phill: It's a watercolour mate
27/04/2018, 18:23 - Phill: Honest mate
27/04/2018, 18:25 - Stefan;: I've got some ecstasy pills that look exactly like kids' sweets
27/04/2018, 18:25 - Stefan;: But can source some powder MDMA if we want that instead
27/04/2018, 18:25 - Paul Dickinson: >instead
27/04/2018, 18:25 - Paul Dickinson: >not both
27/04/2018, 18:26 - Phill: Kan u get ket?
27/04/2018, 18:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Didn't damo find some ket last time?
27/04/2018, 18:30 - Phill: Think he got it online
27/04/2018, 18:30 - Phill: Not sure it's viable now
27/04/2018, 18:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Has that all been shut down now?
27/04/2018, 18:31 - Stefan;: Ket is nae problem
27/04/2018, 18:31 - David;: It's got sketchier not sure about the situation
27/04/2018, 18:31 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
27/04/2018, 18:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Would play
27/04/2018, 18:32 - David;: Lol
27/04/2018, 18:33 - Phill: How much is 2g? Want to K-hole and climb the mountain
27/04/2018, 18:33 - Phill: Thanks for all the drugs lawyer man
27/04/2018, 18:34 - David;: >ket though
27/04/2018, 18:35 - Stefan;: I'll check prices
27/04/2018, 18:35 - Stefan;: Laws are there to be broken, as they taught us at bar school
27/04/2018, 18:35 - Phill: üëçüèæ
27/04/2018, 18:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Snort yourself to a new bladder
27/04/2018, 18:36 - Phill: Dave you'll be honking the ket if it's there don't lie
27/04/2018, 18:36 - Phill: Don't need my bladder anyway
27/04/2018, 18:36 - Phill: Just catheterise me
27/04/2018, 18:36 - Phill: You can sort that Hamish
27/04/2018, 18:37 - David;: Nah, off the ket. That back of the nose dripping feeling. Stick to the acid, you know where you are with nice cosy acid
27/04/2018, 18:41 - Phill: A small price to pay to rabbit hole.
27/04/2018, 18:41 - Phill: I bet you a bottle of pinot that you honk at least a key
27/04/2018, 18:41 - Phill: You will. I know it.
27/04/2018, 18:41 - Stefan;: >you know where you are with acid
27/04/2018, 18:41 - Stefan;: On a 12 hour trip
27/04/2018, 18:45 - Phill: Does acid have a dose that is fully bound to neuroreceptors so if you take more nothing happens? Or could you theoretically trip harder and harder for ever if you wanted
27/04/2018, 18:45 - Rob;: Does someone else fancy pretending to need to buy laughing gas for legit reasons this year
27/04/2018, 18:45 - Rob;: Not doing it two years in a row
27/04/2018, 19:05 - Damian Rumble: I chatting to rob about getting some changa. It's like much more manageable version of LSD. Smoke in a joint. Only lasts 15 mins
27/04/2018, 19:08 - Damian Rumble: Dave was that acid you dug up from under your bed any good?
27/04/2018, 19:41 - Rob;: If we do have Changa, can someone teach me how to smoke properly
27/04/2018, 19:43 - Rob;: ```d0esN't aFfect me oTheRwiSE```
27/04/2018, 19:54 - Damian Rumble: Phil get a pipe
27/04/2018, 19:54 - Damian Rumble: Bong
27/04/2018, 19:54 - Damian Rumble: Something like that
27/04/2018, 20:05 - David;: Yes the lsd was very pleasant
27/04/2018, 20:06 - David;: Its my new favourite. Much more stable manageable and clear headed than 2cb
27/04/2018, 20:11 - David;: It's like your thoughts are still your own but your brain is working more creatively - none of the confusion or brain fog. Plus, the 12 hours great value for money. Its really thought about its customers.
27/04/2018, 20:12 - Damian Rumble: It was 1p LSD right?
27/04/2018, 20:12 - David;: ?
27/04/2018, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: I don't recall of it was real LSD or the 'synthetic' version 1p-lsd
27/04/2018, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: Was it a white tab with tiny writing on it?
27/04/2018, 20:13 - David;: Yeah
27/04/2018, 20:14 - Damian Rumble: Then it's was 1-p
27/04/2018, 20:14 - Paul Dickinson: A synthetic synthetic
27/04/2018, 20:15 - Paul Dickinson: Do you ‚ù§ 1-p?
27/04/2018, 20:16 - David;: It was a complete brain reset. Like turning off and on and defragging.
27/04/2018, 20:17 - David;: Really blew the cobwebs off
27/04/2018, 20:18 - David;: Mental equivalent of a defroust. I did notice a side effect of intense volumes of gas towards the end though.
27/04/2018, 20:22 - Paul Dickinson: Incredibly intense sharting?
27/04/2018, 20:31 - David;: Not sharts, just limitless gas
27/04/2018, 20:33 - Rob;: Limitless gas for everyone in Wales sounds risky
27/04/2018, 20:33 - Rob;: The carbon footprint
27/04/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: Sam are you aware of the facial contortions not Irish comedian Jimeon
27/04/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: *jimeoin
27/04/2018, 22:35 - Rob;: https://youtu.be/9gZcFdKZXsM
27/04/2018, 22:41 - David;: But very clean gas Rob, just unbounded quantities
28/04/2018, 07:58 - Sam;: Jimeoin. How has that name happened. Jim-Owen. Very neat comedy
28/04/2018, 08:33 - Rob;: Trying to stand out in a world of Jim Owens by contracting his name into one word.
28/04/2018, 08:34 - Rob;: The PricewaterhouseCoopers of comedy
28/04/2018, 11:50 - David;: Did you play your little wild card then rob?
28/04/2018, 11:51 - Rob;: Yeah
28/04/2018, 11:52 - Rob;: Mainly in prep for next week as you can't play wildcard at the same time as any other chips
28/04/2018, 11:52 - Rob;: Got me last year that did
28/04/2018, 14:19 - Rob;: I won't miss Stoke
28/04/2018, 14:35 - Damian Rumble: Are Stoke gone then?
28/04/2018, 14:44 - David;: Is anyone listening to the shit souness is spouting about the penalty. 'His brain is telling his foot what to do so the brain cpuld be telling the arms what to do'
28/04/2018, 14:54 - Rob;: I mean they're probably gone, 3 points adrift with only 6 to play for when all three teams above them have 12 points to play for
28/04/2018, 14:55 - David;: But, they play swansea so that would automatically deprive them of 3 points, plus swansea play chelsea
28/04/2018, 14:55 - David;: So closer than it looks
28/04/2018, 14:56 - Rob;: Yeah actually
28/04/2018, 14:56 - Rob;: Could get above Swansea only for both to be leapfrogged by Southampton though
28/04/2018, 14:57 - David;: Yeah i sort of hope swansea drop points to keep it interesting
28/04/2018, 14:57 - David;: I wouldnt really miss huddersfield to be honest
28/04/2018, 14:57 - David;: Although quite like wagner because of the klopp link
28/04/2018, 14:57 - Rob;: Stoke's goal difference is terrible
28/04/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: Would be nice to keep Southampton, a footballing side and lose as many cloggers as possible
28/04/2018, 14:59 - David;: Yeah i want southampton to stay up. They stuck with pellegini far too long
28/04/2018, 14:59 - David;: They actually have a great squad
28/04/2018, 14:59 - David;: Plus they are basically our academy feeder club these days
28/04/2018, 14:59 - Rob;: You need your annual summer signings to get premier league experience. Don't want to be buying from Southampton when they're in the championship
28/04/2018, 14:59 - David;: Where are we going to snaffle up the next lallana from?
28/04/2018, 15:00 - Rob;: Huddersfield's next two fixtures are Chelsea and Cuty
28/04/2018, 15:01 - David;: Kurt zouma was like 'yeah we're very confodent if we win the next games well stay up for sure'. Ah. Kurt. Do you have any sense of anything?
28/04/2018, 15:01 - Rob;: God, then Arsenal
28/04/2018, 15:01 - David;: They could get dragged in
28/04/2018, 15:02 - Rob;: They might be protected by a lot of the teams below them playing eachother - not all of them can take maximum points
28/04/2018, 15:03 - David;: Who else apart from swansea v stoke?
28/04/2018, 15:04 - Rob;: Palace playing Stoke
28/04/2018, 15:05 - Rob;: Palace are level in points with Huddersfield
28/04/2018, 15:05 - Damian Rumble: Stoke are a clogger. Been clogging for the last 10 years
28/04/2018, 15:07 - David;: Nah - under hughes when they had bojan, shaquiri and arnautovic they were a footballing team
28/04/2018, 15:08 - David;: <Media omitted>
28/04/2018, 15:08 - Rob;: A semi-footballing team with a solid background in clogging
28/04/2018, 15:08 - Rob;: Never forgot to clog
28/04/2018, 15:09 - David;: Sure, they never abandoned their clog roots completely
28/04/2018, 15:09 - Rob;: Plan B was always clog
28/04/2018, 15:10 - David;: the wet night in stoke

29/04/2018, 15:34 - / James Ball: Need to cut it to be the size you want for your lights
29/04/2018, 15:37 - Sam;: Aaah. Not in the home obvs.. that would be mental
29/04/2018, 15:42 - / James Ball: I mean, you could gel your lights if you enjoyed a relaxing party atmosphere in your living room
29/04/2018, 15:48 - Sam;: Damo? Tribe every day?
29/04/2018, 16:28 - David;: Ah. This arsenal line up.
29/04/2018, 16:28 - David;: Could go very wrong
29/04/2018, 16:35 - Sam;: Youngest line up since they lost 8-2 to United
29/04/2018, 16:35 - Paul Dickinson: That was great. I‚Äôd 8-2 be an Arsenal fan
29/04/2018, 16:35 - Paul Dickinson: For that joke alone
29/04/2018, 16:36 - David;: Maybe they let them score the 2 so the joke worked
29/04/2018, 16:37 - Sam;: Arsenal have the fewest away points in 2018 in Europe. 0
29/04/2018, 16:38 - David;: Is that all tiers or just top division?
29/04/2018, 16:38 - David;: There must be some grotty romainian 2nd division team who are as shit?
29/04/2018, 16:39 - Paul Dickinson: How have arsenal got away with that?
29/04/2018, 16:40 - David;: Weel he has got essentially sacked as a result
29/04/2018, 16:41 - Paul Dickinson: Very minor point
29/04/2018, 16:44 - Sam;: All tiers. All Europe
29/04/2018, 16:44 - David;: What has iwobi ever done? He gets so much game time
29/04/2018, 16:45 - David;: Iwobi getting dropped
29/04/2018, 17:08 - David;: Why is cech not playing?
29/04/2018, 17:26 - Sam;: I think souness would nutt xhaka given the chance. Absolutely fuming in half time analysis
29/04/2018, 18:17 - David;: Mourinho's new little chairman mao jacket
29/04/2018, 18:19 - David;: The pig iron targets are being met

30/04/2018, 13:25 - Sam;: ‚ÄúAnd it is a brainer, not a no-brainer, and you would have to think about it."
30/04/2018, 13:26 - Sam;: Pat nevin on gerrard going to rangers. Cheers pat.
30/04/2018, 14:02 - Rob;: Imagine describing everything that required any thought a brainer
30/04/2018, 14:54 - David;: Kevin de Brainer
30/04/2018, 17:11 - Rob;: The Bott-No-Brainer wedding
30/04/2018, 19:59 - Rob;: Has anyone got any recommendations for TV and internet deals? We had a pretty sweet Sky+ box and Sky internet deal for ¬£19 a month, but they've bumped it up by a tenner a month after a year and are making us close down the account and start as new customers when my housemate the account holder moves out in a few weeks
30/04/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: Looking to keep it around that ¬£20 a month mark if possible. We might get a Freesat/freeview box to do so
30/04/2018, 20:00 - Damian Rumble: Literally anything that isn't sky
30/04/2018, 20:01 - Sam;: Youview is pretty good
30/04/2018, 20:01 - David;: I just have netflix plus iplayer through hdmi. Does anyone watch tv these days?
30/04/2018, 20:02 - Sam;: Youview has plus BT internet will often land you a free BT sport
30/04/2018, 20:02 - Rob;: Are you just basing this on your Murdoch hatred Damo, because unfortunately telecom giants do tend to be run by successful business people rather than concientious, ethical individuals
30/04/2018, 20:03 - David;: To be fair, murdoch hatred is pretty legit
30/04/2018, 20:03 - Rob;: I have a Chromecast and HDMI cable, but we'd like freeview at least really, the internet in a three person house can be pretty frustrating if you're all trying to stream off it
30/04/2018, 20:04 - David;: That's like 'are you just basing your anti-russian stance on putin hatred? Because post-soviet empires do tend to be run by autocrats'
30/04/2018, 20:05 - Rob;: No, I just mean it's not a field replete with wholely pleasing candidates if you're making your choice ethically rather than on the service provided
30/04/2018, 20:05 - Sam;: Fucking hell lads. He asked for tv deals
30/04/2018, 20:06 - Paul Dickinson: It was never about tv deals!
30/04/2018, 20:06 - Damian Rumble: Tbh as well hatred Murdoch  hatred sky is really over priced for what you get and what you get seems somewhat reminiscent of fox.
30/04/2018, 20:06 - Damian Rumble: Plus they stole the F1
30/04/2018, 20:07 - Rob;: I didn't actually have sky telly, just the box
30/04/2018, 20:07 - Paul Dickinson: Oh. The thievery of F1
30/04/2018, 20:07 - David;: The F1 cuts deep?
30/04/2018, 20:07 - Rob;: Catastrophic rim failure
30/04/2018, 20:07 - Paul Dickinson: A catastrophic rim failure
30/04/2018, 20:08 - David;: Never mind the monopolistic right wing empire
30/04/2018, 20:08 - Rob;: Well thanks for recommending YouView, Sam
30/04/2018, 20:08 - David;: Its all about hamilton's catastrophic rim
30/04/2018, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: The butt hurt still runs deep
30/04/2018, 20:08 - Paul Dickinson: YouCunt
30/04/2018, 20:09 - Sam;: That was the original brand name but it tested poorly
30/04/2018, 20:10 - Rob;: But tested well in the North East
30/04/2018, 20:10 - David;: Tv is over.
30/04/2018, 20:11 - David;: YouJew was also passed over.
30/04/2018, 20:13 - Paul Dickinson: Who‚Äôs actually watching actual tv these days?
30/04/2018, 20:13 - David;: No one
30/04/2018, 20:13 - Rob;: Wouldn't touch a Word document, but definitely still watching actual TV
30/04/2018, 20:13 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôve gone back to internet radio. Just getting on that boat
30/04/2018, 20:13 - David;: Everyone is just injecting heroin into their eyeballs now
30/04/2018, 20:14 - David;: Yeah radio is big. The podcast circuit
30/04/2018, 20:14 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah on the podcasts
30/04/2018, 20:14 - Paul Dickinson: And all the sport
30/04/2018, 20:14 - Damian Rumble: TV on demand. Open source software. This is the 21st century.
30/04/2018, 20:15 - Damian Rumble: Probably should add streaming game of thrones illegally to that list as well...
30/04/2018, 20:16 - Rob;: I prefer to use TV on demand through a decent box and TV. Good to minimise faff, maximise picture quality and isolate your watching experience from someone honking all the bandwidth
30/04/2018, 20:16 - Sam;: Open source ideals just crashed into privacy concerns pretty heavily with zuckerderp
30/04/2018, 20:17 - Sam;: Yeah and you‚Äôll get hd channels
30/04/2018, 20:17 - Sam;: HDMI never looks as good
30/04/2018, 20:20 - Rob;: And actual internet speeds you get, even in bit citie are so shit in Britain
30/04/2018, 20:22 - David;: Just organise your watching collectively? Which cunts are you living with streaming terabites of porn in their rooms while the house is watching a series?
30/04/2018, 20:25 - Rob;: That's exactly what's happening, David.
30/04/2018, 20:26 - Rob;: 'Up to 20 mb' broadband connections can't even handle a little bit of very, very high quality porn
30/04/2018, 20:37 - David;: Hating how the media has lapped up sajid javid. The tories have basically just gone 'i can't be racist, i have plenty of black friends'
30/04/2018, 20:40 - Damian Rumble: It's pretty cunning tbh.
30/04/2018, 20:41 - David;: It's embarassing
30/04/2018, 20:47 - Rob;: Hamish described him as an Asian Mr Burns when he was in the Treasury and I have never been able to think of him in any other way
30/04/2018, 21:11 - Phill: TV and unlimited broadband for ¬£20? You having a laugh?
30/04/2018, 21:11 - Phill: Line rental alone is like 15
30/04/2018, 21:12 - Rob;: We literally just had sky+ and 20 mb broadband for a year, negotiated when threatening to leave. Don't seem to have line rental
30/04/2018, 21:13 - Rob;: Annoying they are essentially forcing us to leave rather than agree to change the name on a contract
30/04/2018, 21:14 - Phill: You're paying line rental to somebody, unless it was like free line rental for a year, which is why they are screwing you now
30/04/2018, 21:15 - Phill: Sounds expensive but I get BT unlimited broadband, line rental, you view, Netflix, now TV sky entertainment for about ¬£50
30/04/2018, 21:15 - Phill: With BT sport as well
30/04/2018, 21:16 - David;: LR m8. No avoiding it m8. Line's don't rent themselves, do they?
30/04/2018, 21:16 - Phill: And just watch sky sports on now TV if there's a big game on
30/04/2018, 21:17 - Paul Dickinson: Surely between you, you can come up with ¬£50
30/04/2018, 21:17 - Phill: London m8
30/04/2018, 21:17 - Paul Dickinson: >London
30/04/2018, 21:17 - Phill: First food banks, next entertainment banks
30/04/2018, 21:17 - Phill: Internet banks
30/04/2018, 21:17 - David;: Caviar banks
30/04/2018, 21:18 - Phill: Please sir, can I have some more (bandwidth)
30/04/2018, 21:22 - Paul Dickinson: In fact only ¬£10 more they were trying to pry from you
30/04/2018, 21:23 - Paul Dickinson: Sounds like London is now just a poverty stricken wasteland full of butthurt
30/04/2018, 21:24 - Rob;: We're only leaving because they won't change the contract over from my housemate whose moving out, not because it's gone up by a tenner
30/04/2018, 21:25 - David;: Wait - bit it would still be a great deal at a tenner more?
30/04/2018, 21:25 - Rob;: It would still be better than any of the deals you can get as a new customer, yeah
30/04/2018, 21:26 - Rob;: But we can't have it
30/04/2018, 21:26 - David;: ¬£3.33 per person per month
30/04/2018, 21:26 - Paul Dickinson: And they have the F1 most crucially
30/04/2018, 21:26 - David;: Less than a pint
30/04/2018, 21:26 - Phill: >the face when not in the 1%
30/04/2018, 21:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 21:26 - Paul Dickinson: The F1%
30/04/2018, 21:27 - Rob;: Well exactly, I'd like to keep our good deal, but sky won't let us
30/04/2018, 21:27 - Sam;: The old account holder thing. Dave and I had the same bullshit with plusnet. Just left it in his name and I inpersonated him on the phone
30/04/2018, 21:27 - David;: Yeah, just do that. Tell them hes decided to stay and just give his name over the phone
30/04/2018, 21:28 - David;: When you deal with them
30/04/2018, 21:28 - Rob;: Yeah I tried to convince Simon to let me do that, but he wants sky at his new place
30/04/2018, 21:28 - Phill: I want to know how robs not getting scammed by line rental
30/04/2018, 21:28 - Phill: Tell us your secrets.
30/04/2018, 21:29 - Sam;: Rob check out relish internet. They do no line rental deals
30/04/2018, 21:29 - David;: But he just creates a new account, same name different email address
30/04/2018, 21:29 - David;: There are many simon's.
30/04/2018, 21:29 - Phill: But Sam, how they get bits to your house with no line?
30/04/2018, 21:29 - Rob;: I haven't been involved in the bills since I moved in, but it doesn't seem to be coming out of our house account
30/04/2018, 21:30 - Sam;: DYOR Phil
30/04/2018, 21:30 - Phill: It's spelt Dior
30/04/2018, 21:30 - Phill: Pleb
30/04/2018, 21:30 - David;: There will be hidden costs somewhere. Lines need renting m8
30/04/2018, 21:30 - Rob;: It's more that in our attempt to switch the account to my name they learned Simon was moving address and closed the account without us wanting them too.
30/04/2018, 21:31 - Paul Dickinson: Lol relish internet. Available in London or....Swindon
30/04/2018, 21:31 - David;: Ah yeah - pricks
30/04/2018, 21:31 - David;: And you cant just create a new account why?
30/04/2018, 21:32 - Rob;: I can, but then I'm a new customer and the offers aren't as good, which is why I'm looking around since we have to get a new provider anyway
30/04/2018, 21:32 - Phill: But traditionally offers for new customers were the best
30/04/2018, 21:32 - Phill: To lure you in
30/04/2018, 21:32 - Phill: Like a pedo
30/04/2018, 21:33 - Paul Dickinson: Lol
30/04/2018, 21:33 - Sam;: Not with sky. They go craters for loyalty
30/04/2018, 21:33 - David;: Yeah rob just let yourself be groomed by a sinister older ISP
30/04/2018, 21:33 - Rob;: It's existing customers who don't threaten to leave who get shafted
30/04/2018, 21:34 - David;: So right now they are buttering up simon in his new house with the best deals you can imagine?
30/04/2018, 21:34 - David;: They're actually paying him to use the internet
30/04/2018, 21:34 - Rob;: Yeah. He's getting to keep the ¬£27 sky+ and broadband deal the cunt
30/04/2018, 21:35 - Phill: Lol
30/04/2018, 21:35 - Phill: Rekt
30/04/2018, 21:35 - Rob;: It's all worked out very well for him
30/04/2018, 21:35 - Phill: My mate at work also got shafted by sky.
30/04/2018, 21:35 - Rob;: It it hadn't happened by accident while I was sitting next to him I'd say he did it on purpose
30/04/2018, 21:36 - Phill: He threatened to leave, so they offered him a slightly cheaper deal, but it wasn't good enough for him, so to test them he said he was still leaving, but instead of going even lower, they just cancelled his contract and charged him ¬£50
30/04/2018, 21:36 - David;: You should just clain that loyalty bonus as a public good given you all paid in equally. Demand he reimburse you the difference on an ongoing basis
30/04/2018, 21:36 - Rob;: Lol
30/04/2018, 21:36 - Rob;: Punishment
30/04/2018, 21:37 - Paul Dickinson: ‚ÄúGroomed by an ISP‚Äù
30/04/2018, 21:38 - Rob;: So he owes me and Luke about a fiver a month in perpetuity
30/04/2018, 21:38 - David;: Lol - how can they arbitrarily charge you ¬£50? Was that a termination fee in the contract?
30/04/2018, 21:38 - Phill: Yeah early termination fee
30/04/2018, 21:38 - David;: Yeah exactly - that's the only fair solution. So will his chikdren and his childrens children
30/04/2018, 21:40 - Rob;: Every time he pauses live television I get a biscuit
30/04/2018, 21:40 - Paul Dickinson: What about the delay
30/04/2018, 21:41 - Phill: Yeah rob think about it this way. You'll now be free of sky's 10 second delay
30/04/2018, 21:41 - Phill: So you can actually watch sport live now
30/04/2018, 21:41 - David;: Lol, the horrific injury. Wasn't it a 5 minute delay originally?
30/04/2018, 21:41 - Paul Dickinson: Yes I think minutes
30/04/2018, 21:41 - Paul Dickinson: Maybe as much as 10
30/04/2018, 21:43 - Phill: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 21:44 - Rob;: ```Delay is real```
30/04/2018, 21:49 - Paul Dickinson: Do you ‚ù§ delay?
30/04/2018, 21:51 - / James Ball: Latency is the word you're searching for
30/04/2018, 21:51 - / James Ball: Don't forget about jitter
30/04/2018, 21:52 - David;: Wouldnt latency be unintentional lag?
30/04/2018, 21:53 - Rob;: I just asked my mate Sam from uni, who was the original source of the delay thing about it, because his explanation was much more convincing to me than mine was to you guys, and he can remember very clearly that he did have a theory about it, but can't venture any more information at all
30/04/2018, 21:53 - Paul Dickinson: >theory
30/04/2018, 21:53 - David;: >did
30/04/2018, 21:53 - Rob;: I think at the time we were watching a lot of football over the sky web app, which is certainly behind the radio, and I'd not quite clocked that
30/04/2018, 21:54 - David;: So he has abandoned this theory or does he stand by it?
30/04/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: Can't remember why he thought it
30/04/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: Offered this 'I guess there might be a slight delay so they can bleep swearing or cut the feed if some shit goes down lol'
30/04/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: There's usually some delay in the satellite feed
30/04/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: Has to be sent to space and back and processed
30/04/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: But that might only be few hundred milliseconds or seconds
30/04/2018, 21:55 - Paul Dickinson: Watching sport over here it goes life>tv>app>radio
30/04/2018, 21:55 - Rob;: So basically he 10 years later no longer believes there is significant delay
30/04/2018, 21:55 - Paul Dickinson: In terms of delay time
30/04/2018, 21:55 - David;: Hmm nah radio before app surely?
30/04/2018, 21:56 - David;: Crucially speed of light>internet bandwidth
30/04/2018, 21:56 - Paul Dickinson: Nah my app always ruins it with an alert before I hear it on the radio
30/04/2018, 21:57 - Rob;: In practice I have been downing a beer on the Emirates concourse just as half time has kicked off, and heard the cheer of a goal from the real crowd about 5 seconds before I saw it on the TV I was watching on.
30/04/2018, 21:57 - Rob;: Socred by Nikolas Bendtner no less
30/04/2018, 21:57 - David;: Yeah clearly life is before any representation of it.
30/04/2018, 21:58 - David;: But we're talking seconds
30/04/2018, 21:58 - Paul Dickinson: But my radio is internet radio
30/04/2018, 21:58 - Paul Dickinson: Actually
30/04/2018, 21:58 - David;: Ah. Vital
30/04/2018, 21:58 - Paul Dickinson: Critical
30/04/2018, 21:58 - David;: Big delay there
30/04/2018, 21:58 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah that makes sense
30/04/2018, 21:59 - Paul Dickinson: Only place I can follow 4th division baseball
30/04/2018, 21:59 - Paul Dickinson: Apart from the app alert
30/04/2018, 21:59 - David;: Is that where the real action is?
30/04/2018, 22:00 - David;: What team do you follow?
30/04/2018, 22:00 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah I follow a range of minor league teams who are feeder teams to the Chicago white Sox major league team
30/04/2018, 22:00 - Phill: Why?
30/04/2018, 22:00 - David;: Lol
30/04/2018, 22:00 - Phill: Why no just bandwagon the White Sox?
30/04/2018, 22:01 - David;: Is that where you see the emerging players?
30/04/2018, 22:01 - Paul Dickinson: Well you‚Äôve got your Charlotte knights, Birmingham barons, Winston-Salem dash, kannapolis intimidators and great falls voyagers
30/04/2018, 22:01 - Rob;: Delayed response, but to clarify, it goes radio, then real life, the bookies suspending odds, app alert, satellite TV, internet TV, full BBC sport livefeed update including goal discription, your mum texting you saying it's been a good/bad game
30/04/2018, 22:01 - David;: >radio, then real life
30/04/2018, 22:02 - Paul Dickinson: No bandwagon on the white Sox. They‚Äôre raw shit and rebuilding so figured I‚Äôd follow a team and learn the upcoming players as well
30/04/2018, 22:02 - Paul Dickinson: Winston-Salem dash are where the action is. The double A affiliate
30/04/2018, 22:02 - Phill: So you're basically doing an independent scouting programme
30/04/2018, 22:02 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah yeah yeah
30/04/2018, 22:02 - Phill: üëçüèæ
30/04/2018, 22:03 - David;: Is this quite niche. What sort of crowds will the dash be pulling in?
30/04/2018, 22:03 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 22:04 - Paul Dickinson: Around 4000 on a weekend
30/04/2018, 22:06 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôs always good to have a bit of baseball on
30/04/2018, 22:06 - David;: >radio, then real life
30/04/2018, 22:07 - Phill: What's your favourite base?
30/04/2018, 22:07 - Paul Dickinson: >delayed internet radio, then real life
30/04/2018, 22:08 - David;: Based base
30/04/2018, 22:08 - Paul Dickinson: All the bases
30/04/2018, 22:08 - Paul Dickinson: All your base are belong to us
30/04/2018, 22:09 - Phill: But one base has to be the most based
30/04/2018, 22:09 - David;: How many balls get bowled per 1 actual hit?
30/04/2018, 22:09 - Phill: Got to be 1st base on second strike
30/04/2018, 22:10 - Paul Dickinson: >bowled
30/04/2018, 22:11 - Paul Dickinson: If you get 4 balls it‚Äôs a walk and if you get 3 strikes you‚Äôre out
30/04/2018, 22:11 - David;: Yeah m8, i'm cricket till i die
30/04/2018, 22:11 - Paul Dickinson: But you can have foul balls in play that don‚Äôt count towards that
30/04/2018, 22:11 - Paul Dickinson: So could be infinite
30/04/2018, 22:11 - Paul Dickinson: The answer David is infinity
30/04/2018, 22:12 - Phill: What's the home run to serve ratio?
30/04/2018, 22:12 - Paul Dickinson: >DYOR
30/04/2018, 22:14 - Phill: Shill me
30/04/2018, 22:18 - Damian Rumble: >Skyxit
30/04/2018, 22:18 - Damian Rumble: >simonxit
30/04/2018, 22:18 - Rob;: Stop
30/04/2018, 22:18 - Damian Rumble: Rob you trying to..
30/04/2018, 22:18 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 22:19 - Damian Rumble: Hey Micheal Barnier in to negotiate your line rental I say
30/04/2018, 22:20 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 22:21 - Phill: >still being this butthurt about Brexit. Stay liberal, nerd.
30/04/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 22:23 - Phill: Damo, if you love Europe so much, why don't you seek fucking asylum there?
30/04/2018, 22:25 - Rob;: üé£
30/04/2018, 22:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 22:27 - David;: >Hey Micheal Barnier in
30/04/2018, 22:27 - Phill: Damo, I was baked last night and thought about sum physics
30/04/2018, 22:27 - Phill: Can you explain something
30/04/2018, 22:28 - Phill: So universe is definitely expanding right?
30/04/2018, 22:28 - David;: Here we go
30/04/2018, 22:30 - David;: ...it is
30/04/2018, 22:30 - Phill: So it must be expanding into something right?
30/04/2018, 22:31 - David;: No
30/04/2018, 22:31 - Stefan;: Phil we've been through this
30/04/2018, 22:31 - Sam;: Butt Y tho
30/04/2018, 22:31 - Stefan;: Many times
30/04/2018, 22:31 - Sam;: Wuts there
30/04/2018, 22:32 - Phill: Must be expanding into something
30/04/2018, 22:32 - Phill: Anyway
30/04/2018, 22:32 - David;: Lol
30/04/2018, 22:32 - David;: Brush past that
30/04/2018, 22:32 - Phill: My question relates to the missing dark matter
30/04/2018, 22:32 - Phill: What if
30/04/2018, 22:32 - Phill: It's expanding into dark matter
30/04/2018, 22:32 - Stefan;: Damo you're fielding this one
30/04/2018, 22:33 - Phill: But because it's outside, we can't see it
30/04/2018, 22:33 - Phill: And it's interacting with shit as the universe expands, incorporating the mass into the visible universe
30/04/2018, 22:34 - David;: Damo, damo - what's the matter?
30/04/2018, 22:35 - Rob;: Is 'see' the right word here?
30/04/2018, 22:35 - Stefan;: Phil next time you're baked listen to last week's In Our Time, subject: The Proton
30/04/2018, 22:35 - Phill: I'm currently listening to brief history of time audiobook
30/04/2018, 22:36 - Sam;: I‚Äôm watching titanic 2
30/04/2018, 22:36 - Rob;: Titanic 2: the sinkening
30/04/2018, 22:40 - Rob;: If the universe has an edge, and if the universe is practically infinite the edge will also be practically infinite, so there should be life on a planet very close to the edge, unless he edge is itself uninhabitable, and there could be intelligent life that can use its proximity to the edge to study it
30/04/2018, 22:41 - Rob;: Do we have any estimation of where in the universe we are, if we've reasoned that it has an edge?
30/04/2018, 22:41 - Phill: Edgy theory, rob
30/04/2018, 22:42 - David;: You would never get to an edge, it's like walking around on a ballon, you will just walk around the baloon forever
30/04/2018, 22:42 - David;: But pop another few dimensions on that
30/04/2018, 22:42 - Phill: Were inside, what's outside?
30/04/2018, 22:42 - Rob;: Well, it you started right next to the rubber you wouldn't have to go far to hit it
30/04/2018, 22:43 - Damian Rumble: Phil - the universe is like the surface of a balloon.
30/04/2018, 22:43 - Phill: Space time curves I get it
30/04/2018, 22:43 - Damian Rumble: It stretches as the balloon expands
30/04/2018, 22:43 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
30/04/2018, 22:43 - Phill: Expands. Into. What. Though.
30/04/2018, 22:43 - Damian Rumble: But it has no edge
30/04/2018, 22:44 - David;: Damo do you have a take on the swiss cheese metaverse thing
30/04/2018, 22:44 - Rob;: Balloon is a bad metaphor. It's all edge.
30/04/2018, 22:44 - Phill: It's expanding in all directions, like a balloon.
30/04/2018, 22:44 - David;: Where we live in a localised bubble of inflating space etc.
30/04/2018, 22:44 - Phill: But you ever tried blowing a balloon up in a box of fixed volume?
30/04/2018, 22:44 - Phill: Can't do it.
30/04/2018, 22:45 - Phill: So, it must be expanding into something
30/04/2018, 22:45 - Damian Rumble: It is so large that it is almost perfectly flat in all directions... As far as light has traveled in the history of time
30/04/2018, 22:45 - Rob;: It the universe basically too abstract and hard to study to bother with it. Just bin it and concentrate on making more Netflix's
30/04/2018, 22:45 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
30/04/2018, 22:46 - Phill: Stop dodging the question
30/04/2018, 22:46 - Phill: What are we expanding into
30/04/2018, 22:46 - Damian Rumble: Now extrapolate that expansion across an unspecified number of dimensions
30/04/2018, 22:46 - Rob;: Who's redacting all your messages Damo?
30/04/2018, 22:46 - David;: Lol
30/04/2018, 22:46 - Phill: Google docs. Hib.
30/04/2018, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: I am
30/04/2018, 22:46 - Rob;: The FBI are censoring you from revealing the truth of the universe to us
30/04/2018, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
30/04/2018, 22:47 - Rob;: Ironic
30/04/2018, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: Need to correct my auto correct
30/04/2018, 22:47 - Rob;: Read managed to read the incorrect version of this
30/04/2018, 22:48 - Rob;: Very meta levels of typo here
30/04/2018, 22:48 - Damian Rumble: Very indeed
30/04/2018, 22:48 - Sam;: Get back to the universe
30/04/2018, 22:48 - Damian Rumble: Yes I'm on it
30/04/2018, 22:49 - Damian Rumble: Anyway... It doesn't make sense to imagine the universe expanding into anything because such an interpretation is limited to just 3 dimensions.... As humans are... Where as in reality the universe is not.
30/04/2018, 22:50 - Damian Rumble: Ergo we can never fully comprehend how the universe expands
30/04/2018, 22:50 - Damian Rumble: Except through math
30/04/2018, 22:50 - Damian Rumble: Que the butt hurt from Phil at this description...
30/04/2018, 22:51 - David;: ...but the swiss cheese?
30/04/2018, 22:51 - Stefan;: "Que the butt hurt"
Spanish for "What the butt hurt"
30/04/2018, 22:52 - Rob;: Has anyone read Flatland... A romance of many dimensions. Qu√© the butthurt after that
30/04/2018, 22:52 - Stefan;: Also this is the point at which astrophysics starts to sound a lot like religious mysticism
30/04/2018, 22:52 - Damian Rumble: Multi verse / Swiss cheese is dead
30/04/2018, 22:52 - David;: My housemate was reading Flatland. He felt the characters were 2 dimensional.
30/04/2018, 22:53 - David;: ü§£
30/04/2018, 22:53 - Damian Rumble: ü§Æ
30/04/2018, 22:53 - Phill: How can you disprove the multiverse theory of you don't know what's outside ours?
30/04/2018, 22:54 - David;: <Media omitted>
30/04/2018, 22:54 - Stefan;: Dave you used an emoji, very out of character
30/04/2018, 22:54 - Damian Rumble: It's a bit like God. You can't really disprove it.
30/04/2018, 22:54 - Phill: This is why physics is such a shit subject, people just bullshit their way through their careers, because know one knows the answer to anything
30/04/2018, 22:55 - David;: Poppers principle of falsifiability innit?
30/04/2018, 22:55 - Damian Rumble: It's more that the higgs boson totally fucks the maths behind string theory
30/04/2018, 22:55 - Phill: String theory ‚â† multiverse
30/04/2018, 22:55 - Damian Rumble: They are directly linked though
30/04/2018, 22:56 - Phill: How do you know?
30/04/2018, 22:56 - Damian Rumble: .... How long do you have?
30/04/2018, 22:57 - Phill: All night?
30/04/2018, 23:01 - Damian Rumble: .... Well in short the standard model of particle physics is a bit shit. It really sucks at explaining gravity. It was suggested that rather matter existing as particles it existed as strings. Thus allowing for a higher number of dimensions... Through which gravity carrying particles or gravitons would weaken as it passed from source to observer. A by product of this allowed for multiverses.
30/04/2018, 23:01 - Damian Rumble: Though you should probably take that description with a pinch of salt
30/04/2018, 23:03 - Stefan;: So basically someone thought up multiverses by accident
30/04/2018, 23:03 - Stefan;: Just stumbled on it when they weren't looking
30/04/2018, 23:04 - Phill: Doesn't explain why another universe can't exist
30/04/2018, 23:06 - Rob;: This is why physics isn't my favourite science, certainly as huge and tiny scales. You don't really get any answers
30/04/2018, 23:07 - Rob;: I believe we're just inside a huge alien's marble as evidenced in video footage seen at the end of Men in Black 1
30/04/2018, 23:09 - David;: So you like sciences which examine trivial questions and provide self-evident answers?
30/04/2018, 23:10 - Rob;: When you put it in condescending terms like that, absolutely.
30/04/2018, 23:10 - David;: 'Biology'. 'Let's count the trees' 'god probably didn't make us' 'chimps are people too'
30/04/2018, 23:11 - Rob;: Yeah, only very simple and easy to answer questions in biology.
30/04/2018, 23:11 - Rob;: Never did anything for anyone
30/04/2018, 23:12 - David;: I do like the golgi apparatus though. And the bowmans capsule
30/04/2018, 23:12 - David;: And ganglions. Weird shit like that
30/04/2018, 23:13 - Rob;: I like that it can be observed and directly experimented on. It theoretical questions are about as frustrating as physics' are. Like the origin of life debate, which is largely speculatory
30/04/2018, 23:14 - David;: Isnt that just all solved with the deep sea vaults etc.
30/04/2018, 23:14 - Rob;: Not really
30/04/2018, 23:14 - Rob;: They just seem a plausible place
30/04/2018, 23:15 - Paul Dickinson: Physics is over. I‚Äôm calling it. It‚Äôs old news and bullshit
30/04/2018, 23:15 - Stefan;: That's you told Damo
30/04/2018, 23:16 - Paul Dickinson: Leave the thread for 40mins to drive home and I have to put an end to physics
30/04/2018, 23:26 - David;: What i dont get about aliens is
30/04/2018, 23:27 - David;: Everyone is always saying 'yeah there's shit loads of aliens everywhere because theres loads of planets'
30/04/2018, 23:28 - David;: But we dont understamd how life developed on earth properly yet so it could have just been a massive freak. Just because you have a planet that is superficially quite ike earth doesnt guarantee jodie marie brain will pop up in a few billion years
30/04/2018, 23:29 - Rob;: Yeah I agree
30/04/2018, 23:29 - Rob;: And it took quite a long time even for microbial life to develop here
30/04/2018, 23:30 - Rob;: 0.8 billions years,
30/04/2018, 23:30 - David;: Yeah, and even then complex life is another massive improbably leap
30/04/2018, 23:31 - David;: The cambrian explosion etc. - so most planets are probably just rotting away with a few shitty prokaryotes
30/04/2018, 23:31 - Rob;: I suppose scientists are looking for microorganisms. it's doctor who that's propagating the fucking loads of comolex life thing
30/04/2018, 23:33 - David;: And they all seem to have heads and have the same basic body structure as us. convienient
30/04/2018, 23:33 - Rob;: The Cambrian explosion is rather over quoted. It's just a diary good first bit of evidence for lots of new body shapes that were quite probably bin exhistance hundred of millions of years before but have just happen to have been preserved in one area.
30/04/2018, 23:34 - Rob;: Alien life could be completely mental
30/04/2018, 23:36 - David;: We won't be able to get close to it
30/04/2018, 23:36 - Rob;: Different conditions might make for a different replicating moleculenjsntead of DNA or RNA. Maybe just proteins and replicating and function molecules. Or maybe just nucleic acid based rather than using proteins to perform functions.
30/04/2018, 23:37 - Rob;: Maybe none of those molecules are stable in the conditions and alien life uses moelcules that can't exist on earth
30/04/2018, 23:37 - David;: Is protein all it's cracked up to be?
30/04/2018, 23:37 - Rob;: It's pretty good
30/04/2018, 23:37 - David;: Hmmm
30/04/2018, 23:37 - Rob;: Even a squiggle of barely protein can fuck you up
30/04/2018, 23:38 - Rob;: Like BSE, that's just a prion
30/04/2018, 23:38 - David;: A fucking prion
30/04/2018, 23:38 - Rob;: Proteins pretty much do everything
30/04/2018, 23:38 - David;: I've never read a book by a protein.
30/04/2018, 23:39 - Rob;: You couldn't read or write a book without them
30/04/2018, 23:40 - Rob;: Obviously he smart is true of more or less all organic compound, but certainly more rather than less with protein
30/04/2018, 23:40 - David;: I just think if the proteins haven't paid into the system they shouldn't be using our services
30/04/2018, 23:41 - Rob;: A lot of proteins actually work in the NHS as drugs
30/04/2018, 23:42 - David;: Oh so they're drugs as well? All they bring is trouble.
01/05/2018, 06:18 - Sam;: Philomena Yarrow.
01/05/2018, 06:18 - Sam;: David Cunk
01/05/2018, 08:41 - Phill: Slept on my universe theory. More convinced than ever.
01/05/2018, 08:43 - Damian Rumble: What was your theory?
01/05/2018, 08:43 - Phill: Expanding into dark matter.
01/05/2018, 08:43 - Phill: The missing matter is in fact, outside of the observable universe
01/05/2018, 08:46 - Damian Rumble: But dark matter is known to exist in the halos of galaxies
01/05/2018, 08:50 - Phill: You're full of shit
01/05/2018, 09:12 - Damian Rumble: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter_halo
01/05/2018, 09:46 - Phill: >Wikipedia
01/05/2018, 10:25 - Sam;: Swede is underrated
01/05/2018, 10:28 - David;: 'I nibbled on a little Swede this morning'.
01/05/2018, 10:28 - David;: 'How did he feel about it?'
01/05/2018, 10:28 - Sam;: Lol
02/05/2018, 15:49 - Phill: Il just leave this here..
02/05/2018, 15:49 - Phill: http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-43976977
02/05/2018, 15:50 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
02/05/2018, 15:50 - Sam;: Lol. Solving a problem you created. He really was a genius
02/05/2018, 17:21 - Phill: James, can you sort some free tickets or something for Cheltenham? Would be on it
02/05/2018, 17:22 - Phill: Saw that you're there
02/05/2018, 17:22 - / James Ball: Quite possibly. Which concert? It's more of a festival in the Edinburgh sense than the Glastonbury sense.
02/05/2018, 17:23 - Phill: Yeah I know, been the past few years but always seem to miss tickets. Saw Laura mvula last year which was pretty good
02/05/2018, 17:24 - / James Ball: Ah yeah. I was working last year as well. She wasn't the friendliest. I fixed up her keytar though
02/05/2018, 17:24 - Phill: üëçüèæ
02/05/2018, 17:25 - Phill: Will take a look at the lineup
02/05/2018, 17:26 - / James Ball: Yeah I'll ask but not sure what their policy is on giving out free tickets to workers.
02/05/2018, 17:26 - Phill: Yeah no worries
02/05/2018, 17:26 - / James Ball: Van Morrison tomorrow
02/05/2018, 17:26 - Phill: Will probably end up there anyway
02/05/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Will give you a shout
02/05/2018, 17:27 - / James Ball: I'm here all week but I'm flying to Korea on Monday
02/05/2018, 17:27 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
02/05/2018, 18:16 - Sam;: Is that your new boyfriend Dickinson?
02/05/2018, 18:16 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôs an old meme but current reaction face I‚Äôm utilizing
02/05/2018, 18:18 - Sam;: So an old boyfriend?
02/05/2018, 18:19 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
02/05/2018, 18:20 - Sam;: So your ex is famous?
02/05/2018, 19:25 - Paul Dickinson: Small game starting soon
02/05/2018, 19:27 - Sam;: Can‚Äôt wait to watch the comeback
02/05/2018, 19:27 - Paul Dickinson: Are you watching round daffys again?
02/05/2018, 19:28 - Paul Dickinson: 2 jumbo sausage
02/05/2018, 19:28 - Sam;: Afraid we couldn‚Äôt reach an agreement
02/05/2018, 19:38 - Phill: Did just smash a sausage and pie
02/05/2018, 19:38 - Phill: About to guzzle four pints
02/05/2018, 19:41 - Damian Rumble: I have to say as a neutral.... It's much easier supporting Liverpool than it is man city
02/05/2018, 19:42 - Phill: Fucking hate that MasterCard kid
02/05/2018, 19:42 - Phill: Never ages
02/05/2018, 19:42 - Phill: Punchable grid
02/05/2018, 19:44 - Paul Dickinson: 93% chance Liverpool go through apparently. Time to fuck those stats up!
02/05/2018, 19:45 - Damian Rumble: Shouldn't you be at work Paul?
02/05/2018, 19:46 - Paul Dickinson: I am?
02/05/2018, 19:46 - Paul Dickinson: Mobile phone Damian. Ever heard of them
02/05/2018, 19:46 - Damian Rumble: Watching it live or just following the thread?
02/05/2018, 19:47 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôm not going to do a you and get myself fired so no not watching whilst at work
02/05/2018, 19:47 - Damian Rumble: It was worth it
02/05/2018, 19:48 - Paul Dickinson: In hindsight
02/05/2018, 19:49 - Sam;: What job did you sacrifice to watch which event?
02/05/2018, 19:49 - Damian Rumble: Ironically it was a job in a pensions company, watching poker.
02/05/2018, 19:50 - Damian Rumble: Though it was actually my terrible grasp of the English language that got me fired
02/05/2018, 19:50 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôm pretty sure it was them seeing you watching poker all afternoon no?
02/05/2018, 19:51 - Paul Dickinson: Otherwise you‚Äôd have been fired again already
02/05/2018, 19:51 - Sam;: Lol. Not even enough English for a back office role. Not customer facing
02/05/2018, 19:51 - Paul Dickinson: >native
02/05/2018, 19:56 - Phill: Honk honk
02/05/2018, 19:59 - David;: HOOOOOOOOOONK!
02/05/2018, 20:00 - Sam;: THE COMEBACK
02/05/2018, 20:01 - Sam;: great instinctive header from Milner
02/05/2018, 20:14 - Damian Rumble: "if Liverpool get another one, then roma would need 7. That's when the semi final starts to run away from you".
02/05/2018, 20:15 - David;: The champions sneeeb final
02/05/2018, 20:15 - / James Ball: Just had a casual little chat with Jo Whiley...
02/05/2018, 20:28 - Damian Rumble: Dave do you fancy a trip to kiev?
02/05/2018, 20:29 - Damian Rumble: I hear it's nice in late may...
02/05/2018, 20:29 - David;: For the chicken?
02/05/2018, 20:29 - David;: What i would like to do is find a massive liverpool pub

06/05/2018, 18:44 - David;: Presenting wenger with the little trophy from 15 years ago. Almost makes it worse, makes the decline abuntldantly clear

07/05/2018, 13:57 - David;: So good

07/05/2018, 14:48 - David;: What's his gig?
07/05/2018, 14:49 - Paul Dickinson: Dirtiest player in football
07/05/2018, 15:43 - Paul Dickinson: Warnock is a draw specialist. Just checking his managerial record
07/05/2018, 17:03 - Paul Dickinson: ‚ÄúI‚Äôd fuckin die fer you lot‚Äù
07/05/2018, 17:07 - David;: 'You've gotta fuckin die to get 3 points'
07/05/2018, 17:09 - David;: 'Take yer missus out, shag her on car seat, anything you fucking want'
07/05/2018, 17:14 - Paul Dickinson: Lol dying for 3 points
07/05/2018, 17:30 - Rob;: The last little interview clip is so Brent
07/05/2018, 17:39 - David;: Lol on Warnocks wiki page it says 'his managerial career has been going on for 35 years'.
07/05/2018, 17:39 - David;: Such a weird way of putting it.
08/05/2018, 08:05 - Phill: Lol watched it again this morning
08/05/2018, 08:05 - Phill: So good
08/05/2018, 08:05 - Phill: We got that bit better quality
08/05/2018, 08:06 - Phill: Might be a nobend int 91st minute
08/05/2018, 08:07 - Phill: It's fuckin I'm sorry and all this bullshit. That's a load of bollocks.
08/05/2018, 08:08 - Phill: Danny go have a bath. You'll just make me sick if I look at ye.

08/05/2018, 08:14 - Rob;: Well why wouldn't you?
08/05/2018, 08:15 - / James Ball: Google translates the two arse spray options to washing and refreshing for the one that gives you a mini enema
08/05/2018, 10:18 - David;: Did you opt for the enema?
08/05/2018, 14:20 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/05/2018, 14:20 - David;: Just got sent this by my supervisor - Stevie G has a second line of work in academic publishing seemingly.
08/05/2018, 14:21 - Phill: Wow, a word document attachment!
08/05/2018, 14:21 - Damian Rumble: He probably uses Google docs though
08/05/2018, 14:21 - David;: Yes, note that very closely as well. Word.
08/05/2018, 14:24 - Paul Dickinson: Oh yeah, rob what‚Äôs the latest on finding a new tv deal?

08/05/2018, 15:37 - Rob;: We're keeping the old sky box as a basic Freeview box and decided to get virgin media fibre to the internet is better
08/05/2018, 15:37 - Rob;: ¬£25 a month including line rental
08/05/2018, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Winner winner chicken dinner
08/05/2018, 17:50 - David;: James do you have any tips on the best noise cancelling headphones for around ¬£200-300? Sennheiser?
08/05/2018, 18:06 - Rob;: My ones you tried at Christmas are _Bose QuietComfort 25 noise-cancelling headphones_
08/05/2018, 18:07 - Rob;: They've been great, heavily discounted now as there is a new wireless model which I wasn't fussed about
08/05/2018, 18:13 - David;: Hebiiiiib
08/05/2018, 18:13 - David;: I would actual prefer wired. I prefer a flan
08/05/2018, 18:16 - Rob;: Yeah, you know where you are with wires
08/05/2018, 18:17 - Rob;: YOU GOT WIRES
08/05/2018, 18:17 - Rob;: GOING IN
08/05/2018, 18:17 - David;: Plus i've heard you lose some info in bluetooth transfer compared to wired
08/05/2018, 18:18 - David;: Although that could be bollocks
08/05/2018, 18:18 - David;: But intuitively it makes sense
08/05/2018, 18:21 - Rob;: I have heard that too, although it might not be noticeable at the ¬£200-300 level
08/05/2018, 18:22 - Hamish Sinclair: More than anything else I can't be arsed with added life admin of having to remember to charge them
08/05/2018, 18:22 - Rob;: It is mental that there are so many brackets of sound quality. Getting good headphones made me realise what total shit Spotify is even on the highest quality download
08/05/2018, 18:24 - David;: Yeah yeah. I was listening to my housemates sennheiser ones in california and it was like doscovering music again. I didnt know music
08/05/2018, 18:24 - David;: That was all i needed to have a great time, just listening. Eyes closed.
08/05/2018, 18:25 - David;: Music was happening
08/05/2018, 18:26 - Stefan;: I went to an exhibition at the Tate modern where one of the installations was just recorded music played at extremely high quality on the best soundsystem
08/05/2018, 18:27 - Stefan;: The idea being that virtually all the music we listen to is of shit quality
08/05/2018, 18:28 - Rob;: I saw a thing where they played the producer of Nevermind listen to the album on an iPhone with the headphones that come with it and he just took them out and said 'no, I can't do it'
08/05/2018, 18:29 - Rob;: *made him
08/05/2018, 18:29 - Rob;: He was like, 'you're ruining my life's work for me'
08/05/2018, 18:29 - Stefan;: Lol
08/05/2018, 18:30 - Stefan;: My perfect creation, sullied and dirtied
08/05/2018, 18:31 - David;: Like if someone showed you all the contracts and casework you have done smeared in human shit
08/05/2018, 18:31 - David;: Or asked you to present the case having inhaled helium and sounding ridiculous
08/05/2018, 18:47 - Stefan;: Or if you were made to present your phd thesis in the form of alphabet spaghetti instead of ink printed on paper
08/05/2018, 19:20 - Damian Rumble: I have some wireless noise cancelling headphones. Tbh I don't really have any problem with the sound quality. But then again I am a musical philistine
08/05/2018, 19:21 - Damian Rumble: The battery problem is real though
08/05/2018, 19:21 - Damian Rumble: I usually get a couple of days of heavy use
08/05/2018, 19:21 - David;: No well if they are good headphones they will still sound good - it's more versus the wired version of the same model
08/05/2018, 19:23 - Rob;: It seems a bit pointless to get wireless ones if you're going to play music from a phone or a computer you work at. Not that annoying to be wired to either
08/05/2018, 19:25 - / James Ball: My professional grade ones I use for work were ¬£190, wired of course
08/05/2018, 19:26 - / James Ball: Anything above ¬£250 would have to be staggeringly good audio quality to justify that price anything else and you're being had on brand names
08/05/2018, 19:27 - / James Ball: The only wireless ones I have are in ear ones for running
08/05/2018, 19:28 - / James Ball: Right. Now back to terrible jet lagged sleep - it's 3:30am here...
08/05/2018, 19:40 - David;: Glad that i woke you for that - urgent consumer advice

09/05/2018, 19:54 - Paul Dickinson: Ket and grapefruit
09/05/2018, 20:35 - Damian Rumble: What the fuck
09/05/2018, 20:40 - Stefan;: I've already got some at home
09/05/2018, 20:40 - Stefan;: Waiting to see my friend who can get more
09/05/2018, 20:40 - Phill: Nice
09/05/2018, 20:40 - Phill: Let me know how much it is
09/05/2018, 20:40 - Phill: I'm seriously keen
09/05/2018, 20:41 - Phill: No joke

09/05/2018, 21:06 - Damian Rumble: Why did I not captain aubameyang????
09/05/2018, 21:06 - Paul Dickinson: Because your moves are weak
09/05/2018, 21:07 - Phill: What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little no-coiner? I‚Äôll have you know I graduated top of Cred's private classes, and I‚Äôve been involved in numerous pump and dumps on Binance, and I have over 300 succesful recorded trades. I am trained in ICT Fibs and I‚Äôm the top sniper in the entire BitMEX trollbox. You are nothing to me but just another liquidation. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of algos across the world and to stop out your position right now so you better prepare for the storm. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing that you call your long. You‚Äôre fucking liquidated, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can liq you in over seven hundred ways, and that‚Äôs just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in Klinger fakeouts, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Tensor chart site and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable long off the face of the planet, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little ‚Äúclever‚Äù comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn‚Äôt, you didn‚Äôt, and now you‚Äôre paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. See you at the Bitcoin convention, kiddo.

10/05/2018, 13:36 - Rob;: Late wedding bap in hand, asking them to put Tubthumping by Chuwunbwumba on for the 4th time
10/05/2018, 13:37 - Sam;: Lol. I meant to write chips but the idea of Coleen pleading with Wayne that 8 chops is enough gets me
10/05/2018, 13:39 - Rob;: It worked
10/05/2018, 13:39 - Rob;: Just chops. No sauce
10/05/2018, 13:39 - Rob;: Wedding chops

10/05/2018, 16:39 - Rob;: Did one last year
10/05/2018, 16:40 - David;: Marrie?
10/05/2018, 16:41 - Rob;: Yeh, half married
10/05/2018, 16:42 - David;: Are you planning a full marrie?
10/05/2018, 16:43 - Rob;: Not immediately. Maybe one day. I'm not sure I want to devote as much time to training as you would need to
10/05/2018, 16:43 - Rob;: Don't often have longer than two hours just to run
10/05/2018, 16:43 - David;: I did a half marathon and that was already a ballache
10/05/2018, 16:43 - Rob;: Yeah, same
10/05/2018, 16:45 - David;: The ballache/enjoyment or sense of achievement ratio wasnt doing it for me
10/05/2018, 16:46 - Rob;: Glad I did it. Don't need to do any more
10/05/2018, 16:48 - David;: Yeah exactly. I also think running is biomechanically shit
10/05/2018, 16:48 - David;: Especially on roads
10/05/2018, 16:48 - Rob;: It's a very convenient form of exercise when you're just going when you want how far you want though. Free and easy
10/05/2018, 16:49 - David;: 5 a side m8.
10/05/2018, 16:52 - Rob;: Not overly fun if you have the touch of an 80s DJ/presenter
10/05/2018, 16:52 - Rob;: Touch of a priest
10/05/2018, 16:53 - Rob;: Touch of a politician
10/05/2018, 17:00 - Damian Rumble: 5 a side is an excellent shout. Doing sport with other people is generally better than doing it in your own.
10/05/2018, 17:01 - Rob;: Prefer a flan
10/05/2018, 17:01 - Rob;: I prefer solo football
10/05/2018, 17:01 - Rob;: One a side
10/05/2018, 17:02 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
10/05/2018, 17:03 - Rob;: Yeah yeah yeah
10/05/2018, 17:04 - Rob;: The existence of myriad sports with multiple participant levels surly renders this debate a load of bollocks anyway. Different horses for different courses.
10/05/2018, 17:11 - David;: No, we have to decide which is best
10/05/2018, 17:15 - Rob;: Alright then it's teh dressage
10/05/2018, 17:15 - Rob;: >teh
10/05/2018, 17:17 - Stefan;: No no, you could not be more wrong
10/05/2018, 17:17 - Stefan;: It's obviously curling
10/05/2018, 17:20 - Damian Rumble: Curling is great. There's a place in bayswater that does it.
10/05/2018, 17:23 - Sam;: Dirty Mike‚Äôs curling shack

10/05/2018, 17:36 - David;: Have you seen the stupid walking races? Imposing an arbitrary limitation that is impossible to enforce.
10/05/2018, 17:37 - David;: Was watching at the comnonwealth games. Commentators acting like they were genuine atheletes.
10/05/2018, 17:40 - Rob;: They are very good at it though, the world record for walking 10K is 8 minutes faster than my PB for running
10/05/2018, 17:41 - David;: Yes but think how fast that same guy could probably do it running.
10/05/2018, 17:41 - David;: I'd rather see him try for a genuine achievement that make up a fake one and win it
10/05/2018, 17:42 - Rob;: Maybe he's useless at running. Slower than walking
10/05/2018, 17:43 - David;: Maybe if you tried it walking you would smash your PB?
10/05/2018, 17:43 - Damian Rumble: I feel like walking should really be in the Paralympics
10/05/2018, 17:43 - Rob;: Lol
10/05/2018, 17:43 - Rob;: Considered disabled by your choice to enter into a stupid competition

10/05/2018, 17:44 - David;: Say what you want, this is just silly
10/05/2018, 17:44 - Damian Rumble: For those who are physically, emotionally, mentally or simply unwilling to run due to ethically or religious reasons
10/05/2018, 17:46 - Rob;: A concientious objector to running
10/05/2018, 17:53 - Paul Dickinson: We‚Äôre not made to walk like that. Wonder if they get terrible arthritis
10/05/2018, 17:53 - Paul Dickinson: ‚ÄúWas it worth it mate for the fused knees and hips‚Äù - ‚Äúyeah mate yeah, nothing like the buzz of race walking‚Äù
10/05/2018, 18:04 - Phill: Some guy on the train sitting opposite me just popper a huge E
10/05/2018, 18:04 - Phill: Popped
10/05/2018, 18:04 - Damian Rumble: Are you sure it wasn't paracetamol?
10/05/2018, 18:05 - Phill: What paracetamol do you know that comes in a multicoloured baggie with a smiley face stamped on it?
10/05/2018, 18:05 - Paul Dickinson: Children‚Äôs paracetamol. Superted
10/05/2018, 18:06 - Paul Dickinson: Baggies for days with them
10/05/2018, 18:06 - Phill: Lol superted. Wut?
10/05/2018, 18:06 - Phill: Who do you supert?
10/05/2018, 18:06 - Paul Dickinson: Do you not get those tablets of super ted when you were younger?
10/05/2018, 18:06 - Phill: Oh super Ted lel

10/05/2018, 20:58 - David;: What train was it lol - just a regular commuter service? An E just really passes the journey
10/05/2018, 21:01 - Phill: The 17:10 from Cardiff to Gloucester
10/05/2018, 21:01 - Phill: Gumped it then hopped off in lydney
10/05/2018, 21:01 - Phill: Grotty little town
10/05/2018, 21:02 - Phill: It was massive as well. A real gobstopper.

11/05/2018, 09:28 - Rob;: Although I don't think I have much of a chance at all, I don't think we've ever had a last day where three people could win before
11/05/2018, 09:28 - Rob;: It's often been done and dusted
11/05/2018, 09:29 - Phill: How similar are Dave and rumbos teams?
11/05/2018, 09:29 - Phill: Anyone got free hit etc left?
11/05/2018, 09:29 - David;: DYOR
11/05/2018, 09:29 - Phill: The tension
11/05/2018, 09:29 - David;: I have a bench boost
11/05/2018, 09:29 - Phill: This dyor needs to die
11/05/2018, 09:30 - Phill: When did it become a valid response to anything?
11/05/2018, 09:30 - Phill: BBC news just replaced with a big DYOR on the screen
11/05/2018, 09:31 - David;: Every night, the same headline: 'DYOR'
11/05/2018, 09:33 - Phill: So who's team is better placed?
11/05/2018, 09:33 - Phill: How did damo achieve 40 more points this week?
11/05/2018, 09:34 - David;: He used his bench boost last week. plus he had aubameyang. But I had free hitted, so my team actually has aubameyang in as well.
11/05/2018, 09:37 - Damian Rumble: >not using bench boost on a double game week
11/05/2018, 09:37 - Damian Rumble: I reckon about there's about a 1/3 overlap between our teams
11/05/2018, 09:37 - David;: >not understanding the counterfactual
11/05/2018, 09:40 - Rob;: So Damo you need to make 15 more points with 4 fewer players
11/05/2018, 09:51 - Damian Rumble: Tbh I'm still not over pep resting all of my man city players, including my captain, last week.
11/05/2018, 09:54 - Phill: >relying on a manager to risk big players in a dead rubber game a few weeks before a world cup

11/05/2018, 10:18 - Phill: Going up the country canned heat
11/05/2018, 10:18 - David;: Remind me by royksopp also great
11/05/2018, 10:19 - Phill: Coma cat
11/05/2018, 10:20 - David;: Lady hear me tonight by modjo

11/05/2018, 10:21 - Damian Rumble: Wake me up avicii
11/05/2018, 10:22 - David;: Obviously pure shores but i will just assume that is on there
11/05/2018, 10:22 - Rob;: We're not cunts in this office, Damian
11/05/2018, 10:22 - Rob;: Pure Shores I bang on there
11/05/2018, 10:22 - Phill: Wake up, avicii
11/05/2018, 10:23 - Rob;: Big Sur is big, sir
11/05/2018, 10:23 - David;: Lovely day bill withers
11/05/2018, 10:23 - Damian Rumble: Blue sky action above & beyond
11/05/2018, 10:24 - Phill: Dreaming of you, coral
11/05/2018, 10:24 - David;: Enya, orinoco flow
11/05/2018, 10:25 - David;: Beatles here comes the sun
11/05/2018, 10:25 - David;: Manu chao - either bongo bong or me gustas tu
11/05/2018, 10:27 - Phill: Rob can I have a link to this playlist once it's complete?
11/05/2018, 10:27 - David;: Fat freddy's drop - Roady
11/05/2018, 10:27 - Rob;: Sure
11/05/2018, 10:27 - Rob;: I haven't added everything, as some are things we have on a lot anyway
11/05/2018, 10:28 - David;: Swing zero 7
11/05/2018, 10:29 - David;: Empire of the sun walking on a dream is classic but overplayed
11/05/2018, 10:30 - David;: 10cc dreadlock holiday
11/05/2018, 10:32 - David;: Obvs MGMT kids as well.
11/05/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: https://open.spotify.com/user/r.goodway/playlist/5UrgE5fl5D5LYQhw16n0x9?si=gGCP6F7HSLyb6tBXBuZOOg
11/05/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: Made it collaborative so you can add to it.
11/05/2018, 10:37 - Rob;: Perfect Wales barbecue sounds
11/05/2018, 10:42 - Phill: Lol Madonna
11/05/2018, 10:42 - Rob;: Literally a holiday classic
11/05/2018, 10:49 - David;: The last 4 minutes of '8 ball' by underworld are so this playlist. But you have to wade through a 4 mintue intro to ge there.
11/05/2018, 10:51 - Rob;: Pure Shores always gets you with he quiet volume at the beginning
11/05/2018, 10:51 - Rob;: Just blew my bonce off when the chorus dropped
11/05/2018, 10:51 - David;: It'll do that
11/05/2018, 10:52 - Rob;: Like when we played it during a K hole
11/05/2018, 10:52 - Phill: Can't wait to K-hole this summer
11/05/2018, 10:52 - Phill: It's what I'm looking forward to the most
11/05/2018, 10:52 - Phill: This caribou Sun song would be mental on Ket and balloons.
11/05/2018, 10:52 - Phill: It's already very balloon.
11/05/2018, 10:58 - Rob;: Balloon d'Or
11/05/2018, 10:58 - Phill: Settlers of Ket-an
11/05/2018, 13:15 - David;: Apparently the victims group for the Grenfell tower is called Grenfell United. I think it's unfortunate they made it sound so much like a football club.
11/05/2018, 13:22 - Stefan;: They're this season's hottest team
11/05/2018, 13:26 - David;: üëç
11/05/2018, 13:26 - Phill: 10/10
11/05/2018, 13:26 - Rob;: Grenfell's on fire, your defence is terrified
11/05/2018, 13:28 - Phill: Was that underworld song used on the Beach film?
11/05/2018, 13:28 - David;: Bad news for next year though, I've heard their striker has started smoking.
11/05/2018, 13:29 - Phill: Sounds like when they arrive on the beach and they're all honking and Johnson is clapping
11/05/2018, 13:29 - David;: 8 ball
11/05/2018, 13:29 - Phill: Yeah
11/05/2018, 13:30 - David;: Yeah, that was the one I mentioned earlier. It gets really huge but there is like a 3 minute intro build up
11/05/2018, 13:30 - Phill: Yeah I'm listening to it now
11/05/2018, 13:31 - Phill: Just reminds of that scene in the beach with topless Johnson
11/05/2018, 13:31 - Phill: "tuk me hours to pluck up the courage to do that"
11/05/2018, 13:31 - David;: 'christianity and cricket'
11/05/2018, 13:32 - Phill: Yeah that little skit as well
11/05/2018, 13:32 - David;: 'your thumbs. they're well defined.'
11/05/2018, 13:32 - Phill: Before shit hits the fan
11/05/2018, 16:52 - David;: Wine bear is looking very closed
11/05/2018, 16:53 - Damian Rumble: :-(
11/05/2018, 16:53 - David;: Richard's wild ride had to end some day
11/05/2018, 16:54 - David;: Very unsustainable business model to openly run a coke den in a cotswold town
12/05/2018, 15:05 - Phill: Currently on a mountain called lord Herefords knob
12/05/2018, 15:59 - Stefan;: Been there done that
12/05/2018, 15:59 - Stefan;: Climbed the knob for duke of Edinburgh
12/05/2018, 16:19 - Phill: Climbing the knob clearly rubbed off on you
12/05/2018, 16:56 - Rob;: Teenagers are always climbing my knob on Duke of Edinburgh
12/05/2018, 20:17 - David;: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

Motorised shed hits 100mph to break speed record at Pendine Sands - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-south-west-wales-44054814
12/05/2018, 20:18 - David;: The guy is from Chippy. Tony's seen the shed wizzing along west street. Blocks up the parking though.
12/05/2018, 20:21 - / James Ball: I've seen it parked in sainsburys
12/05/2018, 20:22 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôs a real piece of shit
12/05/2018, 20:22 - David;: Fucking nuissance
12/05/2018, 20:22 - Rob;: He lives in the house opposite my parents'
12/05/2018, 20:23 - Rob;: They have a lovely barn conversion overlooking the fastest she'd in the world. A real selling point
12/05/2018, 20:23 - Paul Dickinson: Why did he make a shed? What was his logic behind it
12/05/2018, 20:23 - Rob;: > beating a record you yourself set because no one else is competing
12/05/2018, 20:24 - Rob;: He wanted to sell advertising on it
12/05/2018, 20:24 - David;: Not a record anyone is desperate to claim
12/05/2018, 20:24 - Rob;: Had huge 'advertise here' banners on either side
12/05/2018, 20:24 - Paul Dickinson: Lol wants to go into advertising. Best make a shed car
12/05/2018, 20:25 - David;: Obviously.
12/05/2018, 20:25 - David;: He's built the fastest shed - what have you done?
12/05/2018, 20:25 - Paul Dickinson: Traded in the Ferrari got a shed instead mate
12/05/2018, 20:26 - Rob;: I mean it's really a car that's been made slower by turning it into a shed
12/05/2018, 20:26 - David;: What even defines a fucking shed for these purposes?
12/05/2018, 20:27 - David;: If i painted a buggatti to look like planks do i then own the fastest shed?
12/05/2018, 20:27 - Phill: Dave, your car's already a fucking potting shed
12/05/2018, 20:27 - David;: Shove some potting compost into an F1 car: 'using it as my shed mate'
12/05/2018, 20:28 - David;: Yeah and my honda could go faster than 101mph - so i actually own the fastest shed
13/05/2018, 15:32 - Paul Dickinson: What‚Äôs the food like in South Korea? Sugar and octopus sounds like a relatively poor combination
13/05/2018, 16:59 - Rob;: Unless there's some kind of insane bonus distribution looks like Dave will win Fantasy then
13/05/2018, 17:01 - David;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 17:01 - David;: 'I'm on it thrice, I'm on it thrice'
13/05/2018, 17:01 - Phill: Need to get my shit together next year
13/05/2018, 17:02 - Rob;: Rob GoodIVay
13/05/2018, 17:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Next year is my year
13/05/2018, 17:04 - David;: It got quite stressful at the end
13/05/2018, 17:04 - David;: I'd say I didn't enjoy that season from March onwards.
13/05/2018, 17:04 - Paul Dickinson: Next year I‚Äôm going to up research around 300%
13/05/2018, 17:05 - David;: Already got my team name sorted out for next year: Wayne Bridge Analytica
13/05/2018, 17:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Would be good to try the fantasy draft aswell
13/05/2018, 17:07 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 17:09 - David;: Lol, good. Can't wait.
13/05/2018, 17:10 - David;: Can you bring it to Wales and then I will get it re-engraved.
13/05/2018, 17:10 - David;: It's all wrong on the trophy now anyway
13/05/2018, 17:10 - David;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 17:10 - David;: Are the optics better with or without first initials?
13/05/2018, 17:11 - Rob;: Will look cleaner. And unlikely we'll allow any siblings in at this point.
13/05/2018, 17:12 - David;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 17:12 - David;: I was just going for the wimbledon winners board aesthetic
13/05/2018, 17:12 - David;: Quite strong
13/05/2018, 17:13 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 17:13 - David;: I think when I re-engrave I will do it by each year though rather than names and then all years won
13/05/2018, 17:13 - David;: So you get the sense of chronology
13/05/2018, 17:14 - David;: And who dominates in which era
13/05/2018, 17:14 - Rob;: Yeah, and also it doesn't work after 3 wins
13/05/2018, 17:14 - Rob;: We have 4 sides where we can put a plaque. Could get to 40 years before we need a new trophy
13/05/2018, 17:15 - David;: Yeah and we could even probably fir 2 columns on each plaque
13/05/2018, 17:16 - David;: Hope that a new shop will be able to deal with engraving someone else's trophy. Where did you buy it from?
13/05/2018, 17:16 - Rob;: We'll be 58 once we've played for 40 years
13/05/2018, 17:16 - Rob;: Got it from Timpson's I think
13/05/2018, 17:16 - Rob;: I think you'll be fine - they can engrave whatever plaque they have. It's only glued on
13/05/2018, 17:17 - David;: I was thinking the other day how much they have us over a barrell. Like if they decided to introduce a 20 pound fee next year I would pretty much have to pay it.
13/05/2018, 17:18 - Rob;: We'll have to do a proper Wembley style trophy presentation. You walking up the barn steps shaking everyone's hand to collect it to the sound of Three Lions
13/05/2018, 17:18 - David;: Lol - but then it's just a tiny cup full of piss.
13/05/2018, 17:18 - Rob;: Yeah
13/05/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: You have to drink the previous winners piss
13/05/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: The greatest tradition
13/05/2018, 17:19 - David;: Surely jack has to drink piss again as the loser?
13/05/2018, 17:19 - David;: Wasn't that the tradition?
13/05/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: I don't recall anyone drinking piss out of it
13/05/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: Usually we say only former winners can drink alcohol from it
13/05/2018, 17:20 - David;: No it's never been enforced. But it's a powerful unspoken rule.
13/05/2018, 17:22 - Phill: Becca's two year old nephew just threw a afternoon ending tanrum because he couldn't eat just butter
13/05/2018, 17:25 - Rob;: Fair
13/05/2018, 17:26 - Rob;: So were they like 'you can have exactly as much butter as you want, but please just put it on some fucking bread. For me.'
13/05/2018, 17:26 - Rob;: And he was having none of it
13/05/2018, 17:37 - David;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 17:39 - Rob;: Lol. How has that happened?
13/05/2018, 17:39 - David;: Lol no idea
13/05/2018, 17:39 - Rob;: If he got booked from the bench or something and it stops him being subbed for Fabianski it will cost me 7 points
13/05/2018, 17:43 - David;: Yeah I don't know if that will count as playing or he would still be subbed. My guess is he will still be subbed and it would only count if someone was bench boosting etc.
13/05/2018, 17:45 - Rob;: Just checked and he did actually get booked from the bench
13/05/2018, 17:45 - David;: How has he done that? As a goalkeeper on the bench
13/05/2018, 17:47 - Rob;: For celebrating their late winner apparently
13/05/2018, 17:51 - Rob;: So excited by reaching triple point figures he took a booking for it. One for the team.
13/05/2018, 17:55 - Rob;: So you get ¬£1.9m for coming last in the premier league. Wish we'd put a team together now.
13/05/2018, 17:56 - David;: Why pay that? Almost an insult
13/05/2018, 17:57 - Rob;: 5 years ago got you a good little Championship player I guess
13/05/2018, 17:58 - David;: But the parachute payments rob, the parachutes
13/05/2018, 17:58 - Rob;: Better to go down
13/05/2018, 17:58 - Rob;: Parachuting so fun and lucrative
13/05/2018, 18:07 - David;: The famous phrase 'safe as a parachute'
13/05/2018, 18:57 - Phill: We were having starters with a "serve your own butter because you're not a fucking cunt" dish, and he was blowing up because he just wanted to gump the butter raw. Just smash the butter. Not interested in the salami, olives, bread, asparagus. Just give me the unadulterated butter. What a prick.
13/05/2018, 18:57 - Phill: >Oliver
13/05/2018, 19:08 - Rob;: Good lad
13/05/2018, 19:08 - Paul Dickinson: >not bringing your own personal butter to consume as you wish
13/05/2018, 19:09 - Rob;: Remember Zach freaking out when we didn't buy him personal butter as requested in Wales and locking himself in the wank tank?
13/05/2018, 19:09 - Rob;: England are 2-0 up in a little under 17s European Championship semifinal on ITV4
13/05/2018, 19:39 - Rob;: The man from the repro house (the company that processes all our imagery ready for print and retouches it) we use manages Braintree Town in his spare time. Just got promoted to the conference.
13/05/2018, 19:40 - Rob;: http://www.gazette-news.co.uk/sport/16222845.Braintree_crack_open_the_promotion_bubbly_on_a_glorious_afternoon/

Lol: 'Brad Quinton‚Äôs team fired themselves back into the top flight of English non-league football.'
13/05/2018, 19:41 - Rob;: Not sure we'll see him so often now
13/05/2018, 21:15 - Damian Rumble: Been at a tournament all weekend. Only just got home and had a chance to check on fantasy. What the actual fuck!!! Biggest weekend of the year and my entire defence doesn't start! Pep has served this title up to you on a platter Dave.
13/05/2018, 21:16 - Rob;: 7
13/05/2018, 21:26 - Phill: Got hemorrhoids?
13/05/2018, 21:31 - David;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 21:31 - David;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 21:32 - David;: Sophisticated analysis. The BBC
13/05/2018, 21:33 - David;: 'Simple. Metaphor'
13/05/2018, 21:34 - Phill: Lol metaphor
13/05/2018, 21:38 - David;: First time I've listened to the 606 phone in in a while. Savage makes it a very harsh, grating experience
13/05/2018, 21:40 - Rob;: Voice like a pummace stone
13/05/2018, 21:40 - Rob;: Bullying that guy with incorrect grammatical ultimatums
13/05/2018, 21:41 - Paul Dickinson: Damo you should call up and state how it was the biggest day of the year for city and why was pep so reckless not to play his best defense
13/05/2018, 21:42 - Phill: Maybe is being incorrectly grammatical purely for trolling reasons
13/05/2018, 21:42 - Rob;: Yeah, but he ruins it by correcting himself at the end
13/05/2018, 21:42 - Rob;: Doesn't stick with his own joke
13/05/2018, 21:43 - Phill: Trolling himself
13/05/2018, 21:43 - David;: Nah that was the co-host being like 'robbie you're actually talking shit'
13/05/2018, 21:43 - Phill: The double entrollde
13/05/2018, 21:44 - David;: He was sticking with metaphor to the bitter end
13/05/2018, 21:46 - Rob;: Simple. Metaphor
13/05/2018, 21:47 - David;: <Media omitted>
13/05/2018, 21:48 - David;: the BBC
13/05/2018, 21:50 - Rob;: Lol
13/05/2018, 21:51 - Rob;: Why did 606 turn in to Illiteracy Hour?
13/05/2018, 21:52 - David;: Savage will do that to you
13/05/2018, 21:56 - David;: <Media omitted>
14/05/2018, 12:16 - Damian Rumble: So I have nine days of holiday to use up before then end of June and I can only carry over 5. Any suggestions on what to do?
14/05/2018, 12:18 - Sam;: Wankathon
14/05/2018, 12:19 - Sam;: Could do it charity or something
14/05/2018, 12:19 - Sam;: Wanking for cancer
14/05/2018, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: Done it already...
14/05/2018, 12:25 - Stefan;: So WhatsApp have updated their privacy terms so that they can now share all our data with Facebook
14/05/2018, 12:25 - Stefan;: Do we need to move platforms again?
14/05/2018, 12:29 - Sam;: Lol. To both.

The butt hurt of being betrayed. Zuckerberg must have read our conversation on Facebook and immediately set up the data sharing
14/05/2018, 12:29 - Rob;: Is it remaining encrypted at both ends?
14/05/2018, 12:29 - Rob;: I thought that was the one selling point
14/05/2018, 12:30 - Rob;: If they can collect data an keep it assigned to individual users doesn't that compromise that?
14/05/2018, 13:15 - David;: Lol. In the midst of a privacy scandal. Why would anyone use whatsapp over FB messenger if it not encrypted?
14/05/2018, 13:20 - Paul Dickinson: Has anyone brought out any estimates on number of people leaving Facebook? Predict people will finally grow tired of it. It‚Äôs just shit and full of adverts. Apparently the younger audience thinks it‚Äôs shit anyway and don‚Äôt use it
14/05/2018, 13:24 - Stefan;: https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/facebook-whatsapp-change-privacy-encryption-messaging-app-jan-koum-a8330626.html
14/05/2018, 14:02 - Damian Rumble: Lol
14/05/2018, 14:04 - Damian Rumble: Ironically if you barely use Facebook, it's algorithms won't have very much data to train on, and will therefore pitch you less relevant/more annoying ads. And vice versa.
14/05/2018, 14:31 - Paul Dickinson: Front page of Wikipedia in the did you know section has a bit on Jimmy five bellies
14/05/2018, 15:05 - David;: Re. Wales, the dates are friday 13th- tuesday 17th. I think i might have put them in a previous message as 19th-24th
14/05/2018, 15:06 - Paul Dickinson: I always had them as 13th-17th
14/05/2018, 15:06 - David;: Good
14/05/2018, 15:06 - Phill: Yeah always thought 13th-17th too
14/05/2018, 15:06 - David;: Was worried i had put them as 19th-24th at some.point as that was one weekend we were considering
14/05/2018, 15:08 - Jack G;: Yeah I had it as 13th-17th too, can remember thinking we‚Äôll have to watch England in the final in Dolgellau
14/05/2018, 15:09 - David;: Yeah, that's certain to happen. You can nail that into the diary
14/05/2018, 15:09 - David;: Would be intense though
14/05/2018, 15:10 - David;: Would you take shelvey Jack? The great dilemma
14/05/2018, 15:10 - Phill: Welsh pubs probably wouldn't show it out of spite
14/05/2018, 15:11 - Jack G;: Not got many midfield options, we may have to take Shelvey. I reckon Milner, Dier, Wilshere is a half decent midfield though
14/05/2018, 15:12 - David;: Milner retired from internationals
14/05/2018, 15:12 - David;: So would have to be hendo
14/05/2018, 15:14 - Jack G;: Ah yeah, hendo of course. Definitely in instead of Milner
14/05/2018, 17:16 - Sam;: Sky sports reckon it‚Äôs arteta or Nagelsman for arsenal. Are you hearing any chatter on the wires Rob?
14/05/2018, 17:16 - David;: Arteta would seem mental
14/05/2018, 17:18 - David;: In fact both of those would be mental in terms of inexperience
14/05/2018, 17:25 - Rob;: Not had my ear to the ground today, but yesterday it was either Allegri or Arteta, the two extremes of experience and promise, which seems like a shortlist composed by someone who doesn't know what they want
14/05/2018, 17:26 - Rob;: But it seems like Allegri is staying at Juve, so perhaps potential it is
14/05/2018, 17:26 - Rob;: He's very highly regarded
14/05/2018, 17:26 - Rob;: But would be odd to manage players who were covering for his absence of mobility two years ago
14/05/2018, 17:27 - David;: But has never managed
14/05/2018, 17:27 - Sam;: Bagels Mann is 30
14/05/2018, 17:28 - Sam;: Fuck sake autocorrect
14/05/2018, 17:28 - David;: The bagel man
14/05/2018, 17:28 - David;: That must be his nickname?
14/05/2018, 17:29 - David;: He strikes me as the next villas boas. Never played, is young and has a couple of good seasons so people think he must be the next mourinho
14/05/2018, 17:29 - Rob;: I don't know aot about the Bagel Man
14/05/2018, 17:30 - Paul Dickinson: The bagel Mann
14/05/2018, 17:31 - David;: Bagel man, just baking bagel.
14/05/2018, 17:32 - Jack G;: The bagel purist. You‚Äôd expect him to pull a David Moyes and ban ketchup on bagels
14/05/2018, 17:33 - David;: I was remembering that a major reason that Van Gaal lost the man united dressing room was because he took away their chips
14/05/2018, 17:35 - Jack G;: Rooney surely would have started a mutiny over that
14/05/2018, 17:44 - Phill: <Media omitted>
14/05/2018, 19:57 - Paul Dickinson: Fuck Meghan markle. Her family is having a complete shocker
14/05/2018, 19:59 - Rob;: I'm what way?
14/05/2018, 19:59 - Rob;: In* ffs
14/05/2018, 20:00 - Paul Dickinson: Her dad was staging his own paparazzi photographs got found out and is now not even going to the wedding lol
14/05/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: Excellent
14/05/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: Gotta make money out of it any way you can
14/05/2018, 20:05 - Phill: Rob Whatway
14/05/2018, 20:09 - Paul Dickinson: Surely the better strategy is not fuck it up right at the beginning so you‚Äôre now ostracized
14/05/2018, 20:10 - Rob;: I don't know much about her or her family, but isn't she estranged from most of her family already?
14/05/2018, 20:11 - Paul Dickinson: Dunno but this seems like the worst approach to making money out of it
14/05/2018, 20:47 - / James Ball: When I landed at Heathrow yesterday, drove back home via the M25/M4. There was a massive LED sign by the Heathrow junction for the wedding. Wishing the couple well from some company
14/05/2018, 20:48 - / James Ball: Talking like the size of a 3 storey house
14/05/2018, 20:49 - Rob;: It's not even a relevant wedding even if you care about the monarchy
14/05/2018, 20:50 - Rob;: It's like caring abou Prince Andrew's wedding
14/05/2018, 20:52 - / James Ball: It's like caring about your neighbour's best friend's dog's wedding
14/05/2018, 20:54 - Paul Dickinson: But we can all agree she‚Äôs a complete Doberman
14/05/2018, 20:56 - Rob;: Nah that's Dave's nonsense
14/05/2018, 20:57 - Rob;: She could have a knob at night
14/05/2018, 20:57 - Paul Dickinson: So wrong
14/05/2018, 20:58 - Paul Dickinson: Pig in makeup
14/05/2018, 20:59 - Rob;: There's an awful lot worse out there
14/05/2018, 21:00 - Paul Dickinson: Highly debatable
14/05/2018, 21:01 - Rob;: Jodie Marie Brain, Becky Herrin, Kim Soaper. The list goes on
14/05/2018, 21:06 - Paul Dickinson: Grasping at straws
14/05/2018, 21:07 - Rob;: You'll be jealous when she divorces Harry and Marries me, her third and poorest husband
14/05/2018, 21:10 - Rob;: And you're left with Jacqui Radbone
14/05/2018, 21:13 - / James Ball: Sara worvil
14/05/2018, 21:13 - Paul Dickinson: The old bone
14/05/2018, 21:13 - Paul Dickinson: The dog and bone
14/05/2018, 21:49 - / James Ball: Just to add more things to the cultural pyre, Mrs Browns Boys. That can also fuck right off
14/05/2018, 22:09 - Stefan;: How is it so fucking popular
14/05/2018, 22:10 - Stefan;: It's on a par with Brexit
14/05/2018, 22:42 - Paul Dickinson: Never watched it, what‚Äôs the deal with it? Who‚Äôs the target audience?
14/05/2018, 22:45 - David;: She is a real rotter that one
14/05/2018, 22:50 - / James Ball: It's like terrible 70s sit-com with swearing
14/05/2018, 22:50 - / James Ball: And a man acting as an old Irish lady
15/05/2018, 14:44 - Rob;: I kept reading this as 'half sucked off'
15/05/2018, 14:45 - Rob;: "There was no warning. The windshield just cracked and made a loud bang. The next thing I knew, my co-pilot had been sucked halfway off."
15/05/2018, 14:45 - Rob;: China Sichuan Airlines pilot 'half sucked out of plane' survives - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-44121377
15/05/2018, 14:52 - Paul Dickinson: Dog markle
15/05/2018, 14:58 - Phill: We should go to the wedding and protest outside the abbey with plackards
15/05/2018, 14:58 - Phill: "dog markle"
15/05/2018, 14:58 - Phill: "mutt markle"
15/05/2018, 14:58 - Phill: "pig"
15/05/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: Not that one!
15/05/2018, 14:59 - Paul Dickinson: ‚ÄúBeastiality is a crime‚Äù
15/05/2018, 14:59 - Paul Dickinson: ‚ÄúMeghan markles leathered anus‚Äù
15/05/2018, 15:01 - Phill: Tbh I don't buy into this argument. Would bang.
15/05/2018, 15:01 - Paul Dickinson: But you‚Äôd still be there to protest
15/05/2018, 15:01 - Phill: Of course.
15/05/2018, 15:11 - Paul Dickinson: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/04/24/schools-removing-analogue-clocks-exam-halls-teenagers-unable/
15/05/2018, 15:13 - / James Ball: Fucking snowflakes
15/05/2018, 15:16 - Paul Dickinson: Amazing how quickly everything is turning to pure shit
15/05/2018, 15:27 - Rob;: It's basically just nostalgia using an analogue dial now really though. Not that surprising people can't easily use a system there's increasingly less need to use
15/05/2018, 15:29 - Rob;: I don't know how to physical set type but I'm getting along fine with word processing software
15/05/2018, 15:30 - Paul Dickinson: But physically setting type not a universal thing. Telling time pretty useful
15/05/2018, 15:31 - Paul Dickinson: I see clocks around the place a lot still
15/05/2018, 15:33 - Rob;: But the choice to buy analogue rather than digital clocks has been made buy people who grew up with that system
15/05/2018, 15:34 - Rob;: When these GCSE fuckers are buying the clocks they'll be buying digital ones
15/05/2018, 15:35 - Rob;: Or just surrendering to the fact that in basically all situations except exams, swimming pools and nudists beaches, everyone has the time on them in digital format
15/05/2018, 15:35 - Paul Dickinson: You‚Äôre an enabler
15/05/2018, 15:36 - Paul Dickinson: Next it‚Äôll be fine not being able to write
15/05/2018, 15:36 - Paul Dickinson: Have to go protesting with digital signs
15/05/2018, 15:39 - Rob;: I can't hunt or gather, it's fine
15/05/2018, 15:39 - David;: But there's no particular benefit to using digital vs analogue clocks. Whereas huge benefits to  word processors vs typesetting
15/05/2018, 15:39 - David;: Ergo, not analogous
15/05/2018, 15:40 - Rob;: There's the benefit that one is more accurate and easier to use
15/05/2018, 15:40 - David;: Both accurate to second level.
15/05/2018, 15:41 - David;: Ease of use is a matter of familiarity rather than inherrent to the technology
15/05/2018, 15:42 - Stefan;: It's quicker to look at
15/05/2018, 15:42 - Stefan;: Less margin for error
15/05/2018, 15:42 - Stefan;: And one feature of technological advancement is when it's easier and quicker to learn
15/05/2018, 15:43 - Rob;: Ergo, you're a cunt
15/05/2018, 15:43 - David;: 'Easier to look at' - again the outcome of a situated interaction between subject and object rather than inhering in observed object
15/05/2018, 15:45 - Rob;: I would say it's inherent. To telly he time in analogue clocks you have to look a three hands and the numeber they are closest too then convert that into a number and an am/pm
15/05/2018, 15:45 - Rob;: Digital clocks you just read the time
15/05/2018, 15:46 - Paul Dickinson: But the clock. The humble clock
15/05/2018, 15:46 - David;: In analogue clocks you also 'just read the time'. There is nothing fundamentally easier about decoding numerical vs non-numeric signs
15/05/2018, 15:48 - David;: It feels harder to you/us because we are more used to reading digital clocks now
15/05/2018, 15:49 - Rob;: Nah
15/05/2018, 15:50 - Stefan;: Stop with the post-modern French Baudrillard/Derrida nonsense on this Dave, Rob is clearly right
15/05/2018, 15:50 - Stefan;: Clocks are not a text or a narrative
15/05/2018, 15:53 - David;: I'll stick to my sundial and hourglass, thanks
15/05/2018, 15:55 - Paul Dickinson: Bring back chalk and slate as well
15/05/2018, 16:03 - Rob;: I'll enjoy quoting this out of context in the future I think
15/05/2018, 16:04 - Rob;: Not that bad
15/05/2018, 16:05 - David;: Stand by that
15/05/2018, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
15/05/2018, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: Wilshere out
15/05/2018, 21:37 - Paul Dickinson: Mr delete

16/05/2018, 08:25 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
16/05/2018, 08:29 - Damian Rumble: Tbh who hasn't gone to the shops on a simple errand and impulse purchased a tacky calender
16/05/2018, 10:24 - David;: Lol, sir cecil chubb
16/05/2018, 10:25 - / James Ball: Old chubbster
16/05/2018, 10:40 - David;: Wilshere not on the plane.
16/05/2018, 10:41 - David;: He was sat securely in a window seat ordering peanuts and washing his hands with those weird hot towels!
16/05/2018, 11:45 - Rob;: Feels odd that teh argument seemed to be either Wilshere starts or he's not even going. I feel like he's a good option to have even if he's not a starter. Is the person taking his place going to be much good?
16/05/2018, 11:46 - David;: >Jake Livermore
16/05/2018, 12:02 - Rob;: Yeah, not an upgrade
16/05/2018, 13:22 - Jack G;: Would be hilarious if Moysey and large Samuel just ended up swapping jobs
16/05/2018, 13:23 - Phill: Lol large Samuel
16/05/2018, 13:58 - David;: Are you gutted to see Moyes go? Your hero?
16/05/2018, 13:59 - David;: The saviour
16/05/2018, 13:59 - David;: He did a decent job to be fair
16/05/2018, 14:02 - Rob;: Did they only give him a short contract?
16/05/2018, 14:03 - Jack G;: He was only contracted until the end of the season
16/05/2018, 14:04 - Jack G;: Considering he used very defensive tactics we did ship a lot of goals. Don‚Äôt mind seeing him leave but also don‚Äôt trust Gold & Sullivan to find anyone better...
16/05/2018, 14:05 - Damian Rumble: Would really love to see Moyes go to arsenal.
16/05/2018, 14:05 - Rob;: I think Arteta looks done tbh
16/05/2018, 14:05 - Paul Dickinson: That‚Äôs as equally mental
16/05/2018, 14:05 - Rob;: Very mental
16/05/2018, 14:05 - Paul Dickinson: You‚Äôd prefer to have moyes
16/05/2018, 14:06 - Paul Dickinson: Moyes is less mental
16/05/2018, 14:06 - Damian Rumble: Moyes hung on a little too long I reckon
16/05/2018, 14:06 - Rob;: Well I absolutely don't want Moyes
16/05/2018, 14:06 - Rob;: No one wants Moyes except West Ham and he doesn't want them
16/05/2018, 14:07 - Jack G;: I resent that
16/05/2018, 14:09 - Rob;: Arteta smacks of either a board who want to pull a rabbit out of a hat twice and fine another good manager out of nowhere (being slightly disingenuous to Arsene here, League 1 and cup winner as he was), OR a new sporting structure that sees the manager as just a coach
16/05/2018, 14:09 - Rob;: Mostly column B, little of column A I think
16/05/2018, 16:39 - Rob;: Young the oldest man in the squad
16/05/2018, 16:40 - Rob;: Three right backs and only two left backs, one of which is an ageing winger
16/05/2018, 16:42 - Rob;: 5 forwards explains where Wilshere's place went
16/05/2018, 17:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Wellbeck
16/05/2018, 17:09 - Hamish Sinclair: What is the point of wellbeck
16/05/2018, 17:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Rob, have I just not seen enough of him ?
16/05/2018, 17:16 - Jack G;: He can always be relied on to score a goal when he least expects it
16/05/2018, 17:18 - Rob;: I'm quite surprised he's in there
16/05/2018, 17:18 - Rob;: Does seem to do it in an England shirt though
16/05/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: He's very Dirk Kuyt like. He tries so hard you sort of forgive him not scoring much
16/05/2018, 17:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Cannot think of a situation in which you bring him on
16/05/2018, 17:20 - Rob;: He can do late goals
16/05/2018, 17:20 - Rob;: His favourite kind. The late, later show with Danny Welbeck
16/05/2018, 17:21 - Rob;: But really I would bring on Jamie Vardy
16/05/2018, 17:23 - Paul Dickinson: Scores just under half the time wellbeck for England. Can do internationals
16/05/2018, 17:23 - David;: Delph plays left back for city, that's the reasoning there i think
16/05/2018, 17:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes ardy seems useless for group games against shit teams tjo
16/05/2018, 17:24 - Hamish Sinclair: May bloot against belgium
16/05/2018, 17:24 - Phill: Doesn't matter who we take. It'll still be a disappointment.
16/05/2018, 17:24 - David;: Yes, why wellbeck. Another shitter striker in an area we have lots of great players over a unique central midfielder where we have bugger all
16/05/2018, 17:25 - David;: Literally what's the first choice central midfield? Hendo and Dier? That's a shit show
16/05/2018, 17:27 - Phill: First 11 should be:
16/05/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Trent
16/05/2018, 17:27 - Rob;: In goal?
16/05/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Trent, trent, trent, trent
16/05/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Trent, Trent, Trent, Trent,
16/05/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Trent, Trent
16/05/2018, 17:28 - David;: 'We all dream of a team of carragher's'
16/05/2018, 17:35 - David;: Why is tom davies never mentioned? Would certainly pick him over fucking livermore. Does passing.
16/05/2018, 17:38 - Paul Dickinson: Trent looks good. Rate Trent
16/05/2018, 17:38 - Paul Dickinson: Get Trent in all the bench spots as well
16/05/2018, 17:42 - David;: Were you watching 'the scouse lahm' video?
16/05/2018, 17:42 - Paul Dickinson: Have I no seen that
16/05/2018, 17:43 - David;: Assumed that was where you were getting your assessment
16/05/2018, 17:43 - Paul Dickinson: Here I am little lahm
16/05/2018, 18:20 - Stefan;: Has anyone heard the news story about Malaysia's new PM? They keep saying on radio 4 that he'd previously been jailed on "trumped-up sodomy charges"
16/05/2018, 18:21 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
16/05/2018, 19:36 - Paul Dickinson: Salah better than Messi and Ronaldo
16/05/2018, 19:38 - Phill: No shit
16/05/2018, 19:39 - David;: Fact
16/05/2018, 19:40 - David;: Simple. Metaphor.
16/05/2018, 19:41 - Paul Dickinson: The least controversial statement you‚Äôll hear all year
16/05/2018, 21:23 - David;: Rob are you aware of wiggly wegerle?
17/05/2018, 09:34 - Rob;: Parketry. What???
17/05/2018, 10:25 - David;: Tony was telling me sambo and phil about him. American footballer in the 80s/90s who played like messi. Got his name because he wiggled past defenders. Roy wegerle - wiggly wegerle
17/05/2018, 10:26 - David;: https://youtu.be/TOUaDs_55E4
17/05/2018, 10:26 - David;: Cracking out these sort of goals
17/05/2018, 12:53 - Rob;: My friend freddie and I are filling a Panini Sticker book with illustrated palyers
17/05/2018, 12:53 - Rob;: Just offered it around the office, looking for a mix of styles
17/05/2018, 12:55 - Rob;: And immediately some cunt emails a link to a BBC article about a couple who also had the same idea saying 'already done mate'
17/05/2018, 12:55 - Rob;: Freddie's are amazing...
17/05/2018, 12:55 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/05/2018, 12:56 - Rob;: Mine, well, ahem...
17/05/2018, 12:56 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/05/2018, 12:56 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/05/2018, 12:56 - Rob;: But we're looking for a rich tapestry of styles, perhaps even tapestry
17/05/2018, 12:56 - Rob;: Would anyone like to contribute?
17/05/2018, 12:58 - Phill: Yeah I'll do one
17/05/2018, 12:58 - Phill: Any player?
17/05/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: Not Kane, Giroud, Messi, or Dele ali
17/05/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: We'll make a Google Doc of who's been taken
17/05/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: We have a template to fit into
17/05/2018, 13:06 - David;: This sounds mental
17/05/2018, 13:50 - Paul Dickinson: Show us the rest
17/05/2018, 14:00 - Rob;: Only one more done so far. We had the idea on Tuesday
17/05/2018, 14:24 - Rob;: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12AKl3PDjC_sDdY9WJNJBssWeBuMb1Hsn5WoiJK7-Fxw/edit?usp=drivesdk
17/05/2018, 14:25 - Rob;: There's the list and a template
17/05/2018, 14:30 - Paul Dickinson: Oh yeah how did some cunts make it to bbc news with this? Bbc really has gone to complete shit. It‚Äôs just meme news now
17/05/2018, 15:47 - / James Ball: Memes, royal wedding and celeb gossip
17/05/2018, 15:47 - / James Ball: I did notice that it was slightly changed/censored in Korea
17/05/2018, 16:10 - Paul Dickinson: Lol the plastic straw
17/05/2018, 16:10 - Paul Dickinson: I like it in the USA how they use plastic cocktail straws instead of spoons. Retarded
17/05/2018, 16:11 - Paul Dickinson: And paper cups
17/05/2018, 16:11 - / James Ball: The exquisite irony. She was so perky and happy about it too.

Yeah I noticed that when I was there.
17/05/2018, 16:11 - Paul Dickinson: Apparently in our office they‚Äôre too afraid of germs and trusting people to clean up mugs properly so we use loads of paper cups and plates
17/05/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: They‚Äôre so stupid. Moronic
17/05/2018, 16:12 - / James Ball: There is a big germ phobia. Last time I met Dan over there he was anxious to wash his hands
17/05/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: Previous uk people suggested it so to save on waste at this office and it caused a rebellion
17/05/2018, 16:13 - / James Ball: Oh incidentally, I'll probably be back in the USA in September, including Chicago
17/05/2018, 16:13 - Paul Dickinson: Even putting your plastic fork or knife down on a surface then going to use it you have people rushing to throw it away for you as it‚Äôs now covered in germs apparently
17/05/2018, 16:14 - Damian Rumble: Paul Dickinson. King among morons.

17/05/2018, 16:53 - Damian Rumble: Tbh I have also clocked a number of articles recently that explore random people sex lives. With that and the members It's basically like reading vice.
17/05/2018, 16:53 - Damian Rumble: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

Sex addiction: 'Five times a day wasn't enough' - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-43921760
17/05/2018, 16:54 - Rob;: They have department called BBC trending that basically just regurgitates whatevers gone viral so your mum can read it too
17/05/2018, 16:54 - Rob;: Some times they bother to verify and explain if it's wrong, which is useful, but otherwise completely pointless
17/05/2018, 16:55 - Rob;: I guess in an industry driven by clicks people get the news they deserve
17/05/2018, 16:56 - Paul Dickinson: Bring back king and country for the discerning news reader
17/05/2018, 16:57 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
17/05/2018, 16:58 - Damian Rumble: The steady erosion of all other media until the only form way to get any form of information is to read 'closer'

17/05/2018, 17:15 - Damian Rumble: Though in reality the bulk of cases can be put down to laziness/using a phone interface
17/05/2018, 17:16 - Rob;: Damian, you do have dyslexia. You spelled dyslexia wrong
17/05/2018, 17:18 - Paul Dickinson: Lol
17/05/2018, 17:19 - / James Ball: Damian maybe you should engineer some other kind of interface for yourself

17/05/2018, 17:19 - / James Ball: A direct rumble brain to whatsapp interface
17/05/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: I can't believe no one's diagnosed you before

17/05/2018, 17:21 - Rob;: So you're not just dyslexic, you've missed out on an iMac
17/05/2018, 17:21 - Damian Rumble: I actually did the test at chippy and it came back negative so screw you guys
17/05/2018, 17:22 - Paul Dickinson: You‚Äôre just a fucking dunce then. No sympathy
17/05/2018, 17:22 - / James Ball: Damian, we're not talking about the feline aids test you took

17/05/2018, 18:50 - Jack G;: Would be really happy with Benitez. Don‚Äôt understand why he‚Äôs come though, trading one shit owner for a pair of shit owners
17/05/2018, 18:50 - Jack G;: He‚Äôd

17/05/2018, 22:38 - Sam;: Savage. I get none. Didn‚Äôt think gifs could have sound
17/05/2018, 22:38 - David;: Somehow whatsapp seems to count these gifs as just videos
17/05/2018, 22:39 - David;: One more reason to hate zuckerberg
17/05/2018, 22:39 - / James Ball: Very much a video Sam

18/05/2018, 13:46 - Jack G;: Yep
18/05/2018, 13:47 - Jack G;: Marlon harewood missing an open goal in extra time :(
18/05/2018, 13:53 - Paul Dickinson: Trash west ham

18/05/2018, 15:32 - Phill: Stefan how's the ket hunt?

18/05/2018, 17:57 - / James Ball: I'm working a festival this weekend - my elderly neighbour on hearing that I was working: "oh and they'll be such a wonderful extra feeling of celebration this weekend what with the royal wedding"
18/05/2018, 17:58 - / James Ball: There'll*
18/05/2018, 17:59 - / James Ball: I'll be sure to pass that on to all the hippies in a field this weekend...
18/05/2018, 17:59 - David;: No, no fucking difference to anything. Everyone who feels any happier as a result is having a total shocker.
18/05/2018, 18:01 - Sam;: Wish I had some ownership stake in a royal memorabilia shop
18/05/2018, 18:02 - / James Ball: Just print some out and sell it
18/05/2018, 18:02 - David;: BBC interviewing people who have flown over from LA to watch. No connection to the royal family. Do they have any idea what they are doing?

18/05/2018, 18:44 - / James Ball: @447854020575 I'm at Wood which is an eco festival near Oxford. Probably not your scene!
18/05/2018, 18:45 - Damian Rumble: Eco fest. Bet they they love the monarchy there.
18/05/2018, 18:45 - / James Ball: Common people in Oxford next weekend where I'll be running the DJ stage though
18/05/2018, 18:46 - / James Ball: That's usually full of wasted pill heads by about 2pm
18/05/2018, 18:46 - Damian Rumble: Now we're talking...
18/05/2018, 18:47 - / James Ball: Lots of the worst kind of Guardian reading Waitrose going folks here this weekend though
18/05/2018, 18:47 - Damian Rumble: Have you even been to Oxford?
18/05/2018, 18:48 - / James Ball: It's easy money. I make it ear splittingly loud with some very large speakers for two days and walk away with cash. I just have to deal with dickhead DJs
18/05/2018, 18:48 - / James Ball: Oh, you mean that city I lived in for 10 years? No never
18/05/2018, 20:29 - Phill: How much herbal medicine do people want for Wales?
18/05/2018, 20:30 - Damian Rumble: Shotgun

18/05/2018, 20:32 - David;: I think I'm building my blooting strategy around weed, booze and acid.
18/05/2018, 20:33 - Phill: Mine is the same, except mostly ket.
18/05/2018, 20:33 - Phill: Probably will try a little micro dose of the old acid if there's any going

18/05/2018, 20:38 - Phill: What's a spelling mistake amongst friends?
18/05/2018, 20:39 - David;: Yeah, it's not like we'd ever pick you up on it or use it relentlessly for the next decade
18/05/2018, 20:40 - / James Ball: Also you wrote "dinner acid"who are we to argue what your diet is
18/05/2018, 20:40 - David;: 7

18/05/2018, 20:41 - David;: Ferrero rocher and lsd tabs stacked in a little tower.
18/05/2018, 20:44 - / James Ball: The ambassador will be pleased
18/05/2018, 20:45 - Phill: Kek
18/05/2018, 20:46 - David;: Yeah I'd be interested - do you steady access or is a voyage into the silk road a dicey affair these days?
18/05/2018, 20:46 - David;: Mongols, Kazakhs and the FBI liable to raid your caravan
18/05/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: I haven't checked out the dark web since last Wales. Investigating now
18/05/2018, 20:47 - Phill: While you're there, can I get some child porn and a Glock for Wales. Thanks.
18/05/2018, 20:48 - David;: Glad whatsapp is still end-to-end enrcypted.

18/05/2018, 20:48 - / James Ball: Surely pick up some sex slaves while you're there as well. Can you just add them to your basket?
18/05/2018, 20:49 - David;: A eunuch and some surface-to-air missiles
18/05/2018, 20:49 - David;: I have very specific needs

18/05/2018, 21:06 - Paul Dickinson: @447752458076 put me down for an 8ball which is 3.5g and it should come with a bulk buy discount

19/05/2018, 17:33 - Sam;: If by chance there‚Äôs a first half goal it might become good

19/05/2018, 17:36 - Sam;: Oh god
19/05/2018, 17:36 - Jack G;: Glad we‚Äôre taking Jones to the World Cup over smalling
19/05/2018, 17:39 - Jack G;: Why are they saying it‚Äôs a red? Pretty sure they changed the rules this season so penalty + red is really unlikely
19/05/2018, 17:41 - Sam;: Exactly, embarrassing for pundits to not know a rule like that. Chelsea don‚Äôt seem to know it either, all calling for the red
19/05/2018, 17:43 - Jack G;: Does Keown even know? Looking forward to the shite punditry banter at the World Cup
19/05/2018, 17:45 - Rob;: However that was a mental challenge. Not even directing himself towards the ball
19/05/2018, 17:46 - Rob;: Like a bag of potatoes being thrown hastily at a China tea set
19/05/2018, 17:46 - Sam;: Standard jones really. It goes with the gurns
19/05/2018, 17:47 - Rob;: Like a cow in a Japan shop
19/05/2018, 17:47 - Jack G;: He was definitely gurning as he made the challenge
19/05/2018, 17:57 - David;: You'd take the gurns over solid defending though. The comedy value
19/05/2018, 17:58 - David;: He will probably be playing for england against hazard when we play belgium. Surprised the commentators not gumping more on the world cup angle.
19/05/2018, 18:01 - Jack G;: I love the idea of a scout for defenders: ‚ÄúGreat, so you‚Äôve got good positioning sense, but can you pull an expression like you‚Äôve just sharted?‚Äù

21/05/2018, 21:14 - David;: Good? Shit? Hard to even say anymore
21/05/2018, 21:16 - Rob;: Didn't win the league with PSG's resources is slightly worrying. But does trophies
21/05/2018, 21:16 - Rob;: It's certainly less risky business than Arteta
21/05/2018, 21:17 - Sam;: He did win the league and got manager of the year this season
21/05/2018, 21:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Should have got arteta
21/05/2018, 21:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Has repeatedly fucked up the only competition that presented any real challenge (champions league)
21/05/2018, 21:19 - Paul Dickinson: Why would anyone want to go manage a ragtag bunch of shit? Better off calling it a day and not having to manage a team designed for moyes
21/05/2018, 21:19 - Sam;: But do Europa league. Three wins with Sevilla.
21/05/2018, 21:19 - Hamish Sinclair: I don't see what you have to lose by getting arteta? You finished 6th, even if he's shit you arnt going to finish 7th

21/05/2018, 21:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Experience is overrated
21/05/2018, 21:23 - Jack G;: Doubt Arteta could attract as good signings either
21/05/2018, 21:23 - Rob;: Man u went from 6th to 2nd this year, we went from 2nd to 5th the year before. The top teams change a lot
21/05/2018, 21:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, but arsenal are very much at the bottom of their potential right now
21/05/2018, 21:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Therefore, you literally have nothing to lose by taking a punt on the "next arsene wenger"
21/05/2018, 21:34 - Paul Dickinson: But you need someone who has a tenuous name link
21/05/2018, 21:34 - Paul Dickinson: Arteta just doesn‚Äôt offer that

27/05/2018, 16:09 - Rob;: I think it would be quite a nice move for him - he gets to stay busy and work in football, which is what he loves, but no one will really care

27/05/2018, 18:56 - David;: The topping getting smeared off at random. Uneven slices.
27/05/2018, 18:57 - David;: All the time smelling of shit. Have to stress that as well
27/05/2018, 18:58 - Paul Dickinson: He was smelling of shit or you were eating shit pizza
27/05/2018, 18:58 - Paul Dickinson: The classic pizza flavor
27/05/2018, 18:58 - David;: No sam was the source of the shit. Pizza was peperonni
27/05/2018, 18:58 - Paul Dickinson: Old shit bag
27/05/2018, 18:59 - Rob;: Shit feast pizza
27/05/2018, 18:59 - David;: Cerebrally, cerebrally Palsy
27/05/2018, 19:05 - David;: Weather is over. More lightening forecast tonight as well
27/05/2018, 19:06 - Rob;: I was too pissed to notice  it last night
27/05/2018, 19:07 - Rob;: Most extreme lighting storm ever and I'm just chugging coronas with my arm around the bride's mum
27/05/2018, 19:15 - David;: I feel that statement also needs unpacking
27/05/2018, 19:17 - Rob;: I was at a wedding
27/05/2018, 19:18 - David;: Who was the bride?
27/05/2018, 19:18 - Rob;: At about 10:30, which is when I read the storm was, I was dancing with a lot of people, including the mum
27/05/2018, 19:18 - Rob;: My housemate's new wife's mum
27/05/2018, 19:18 - Rob;: We had met once before
27/05/2018, 19:19 - David;: You'd had a few drinks?
27/05/2018, 19:19 - David;: What sort of tunes were being cracked out - basic bitch wedding fare?
27/05/2018, 19:30 - Phill: Terribly cerebly palsy
27/05/2018, 22:07 - Rob;: Very much a Spotify Summer W dding playlist affair
27/05/2018, 22:12 - Rob;: Noel Gallagher is the worst Noel Gallagher tribute act going
27/05/2018, 22:12 - Rob;: He's on BBC 2 now being total shit at being himself
27/05/2018, 22:47 - Rob;: Watching Underworld instead. They are almost exactly Mark and Jeremy from Peep show
27/05/2018, 23:13 - Damian Rumble: Watching the third Hobbit. My god this is a pile of CGI wank....
27/05/2018, 23:13 - Rob;: It's the worse one
27/05/2018, 23:13 - Rob;: Worst
27/05/2018, 23:14 - Rob;: The fucking extended chase scene up the mountain at the end for no reason
27/05/2018, 23:20 - Damian Rumble: Tbh I'm just killing time until the rugby highlights begin...
27/05/2018, 23:20 - David;: Never a good idea to take one chapter from a children's book as the basis for a 3 hour film
27/05/2018, 23:22 - Rob;: Or to take a book partly about the corrupting power of wealth and divide and extend it in order to make more money
28/05/2018, 10:58 - Sam;: Quite like what the lads are doing with this indexing system for European clubs
Real Madrid overtaken by Barcelona as Europe's top club - new data
http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44272077
28/05/2018, 12:23 - Damian Rumble: Wales. We have blan y Cwm until the Wednesday 18th right. 

It seems to me a bit pointless to head back to London to work for a couple of days when I could stay in North Wales instead.

 So after Wales I'm tempted so spend a day or two climbing Snowdon/doing other outdoor activities, etc. 

Obviously if anyone else wants to join me that would be cool. But if not bare in mind that this might impact how you get back to London if I am giving you a lift.
28/05/2018, 14:22 - Phill: Think we have it until the 17th
28/05/2018, 14:37 - Rob;: Impossible not to like Klopp really https://twitter.com/Oliver__Bond/status/1000705656507322368?s=19
28/05/2018, 14:39 - David;: Lol. Seen this before but still can't work out the lyrics. Incomprehensible
28/05/2018, 14:39 - David;: 'European cup' and 'bring it back to liverpool' all i can decipher
28/05/2018, 14:39 - Rob;: We saw the European Cup / But Real Madrid had all the fucking luck, about as far as I got
28/05/2018, 15:00 - Rob;: Arsenal look to be signing their third 29-year-old former Borussia Dortmund player in 4 months
28/05/2018, 15:01 - Rob;: Sven Mislintat's main strategy as chief scout being to just rebut everyone he's bought before
28/05/2018, 15:04 - Hamish Sinclair: The harry rednapp approach
28/05/2018, 15:07 - Rob;: As long as the approach includes the end of Mustafi I am fine with it
28/05/2018, 22:32 - Sam;: Fabinho
28/05/2018, 22:35 - David;: A player
28/05/2018, 22:35 - David;: Does midfield
28/05/2018, 22:37 - Paul Dickinson: Worth having?
28/05/2018, 22:37 - Paul Dickinson: A Charlie Adams replacement?
28/05/2018, 22:38 - David;: Yeah been gumping through his youtube videos. Classic klopp player, winning balls high and launching attacks. Can score you a goal as well. Fabinho>Can.
28/05/2018, 22:39 - David;: Fabinho>Can>Adams
29/05/2018, 15:28 - Rob;: I remember gumping through Granite Xhaka's YouTube videos. A cautionary tale.
29/05/2018, 15:29 - Rob;: The Aesop's fable of our times
29/05/2018, 15:32 - Paul Dickinson: So fabhino will just turn shit?
29/05/2018, 15:33 - Paul Dickinson: Or are you just butt devastated over the arsenal fall from grace
29/05/2018, 15:35 - Rob;: Oh I'm sure he's a good player
29/05/2018, 15:35 - Rob;: But YouTube videos can definitely make you get excited over the most inconsistent annoying players
29/05/2018, 15:42 - Paul Dickinson: The Andy Carroll highlight reel
29/05/2018, 16:26 - David;: They cannot tell you how good they are but they can tell you what sort of player they are.
29/05/2018, 16:26 - David;: And he definitely fits the system. Plus stats. 22 goals in 100 appearences. Pretty decent from central mid
29/05/2018, 16:27 - David;: Simple. Metaphor.
29/05/2018, 16:27 - Phill: Seems to take loads of pens though.
29/05/2018, 16:28 - David;: Anyway, he seems at least as good as can and possibly an upgrade
29/05/2018, 16:28 - Jack G;: You‚Äôre squad is looking very good with the additions of Fabinho and Keita. If you land a top keeper as well I can only see an even better season for you
29/05/2018, 16:29 - David;: Yeah if we keep hold of salah and firmino as well.
29/05/2018, 16:30 - David;: Probably need a rotation option for the front 3 - i.e. if we sign Fekir as well
29/05/2018, 16:30 - Rob;: The best thing is that Fabinho could replace Coutinho in the we've got Salah song
29/05/2018, 16:31 - David;: I presume that's why we moved so quickly for him
29/05/2018, 16:31 - Paul Dickinson: And that‚Äôs crufts
29/05/2018, 16:31 - David;: Firmino needs a brazillian mate as well. Think how sad he will be otherwise
29/05/2018, 16:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh, every good player in he Liverpool team is best mates with a shit one. We kept Moreno cos he was mates with coutinho, apparently lovren and Salah are best mates...
29/05/2018, 17:09 - David;: Would be good if messi's best friends were charlie adam and titus bramble. Refused to play in a team without them. So that was a tactical dilemma the manager just had to deal with
29/05/2018, 17:23 - Paul Dickinson: Ronaldo‚Äôs best mate; gazza, refuses to not live with him as his roommate
29/05/2018, 21:59 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
29/05/2018, 22:00 - Rob;: But we always signal out Brexits with the bonging if a very old ornate clock
29/05/2018, 22:00 - Rob;: Situated in a city that overwhelmingly didn't want a Brexit
29/05/2018, 22:03 - Stefan;: Classic Daily Mail "fury"
29/05/2018, 22:04 - Stefan;: As if these emotions of outrage and anger just exist out there, in the ether
29/05/2018, 22:04 - Rob;: I just really like how the capitalized 'won't' makes it seem like we were all unquestionably expecting a big bonging
29/05/2018, 22:16 - / James Ball: Probably should just celebrate it by summarily executing some Europeans instead
29/05/2018, 23:01 - David;: Was thinking today in relation to this story it would be good if the left made headlines more like the daily mail sometimes:
29/05/2018, 23:01 - David;: https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/may/29/severe-obesity-rates-children-primary-school-figures
29/05/2018, 23:02 - David;: The Logic is basically: "Are Tory cuts turning YOUR children fat?"
29/05/2018, 23:07 - Rob;: Yeah there's room in the market for more grotbag left
29/05/2018, 23:07 - Rob;: The Mirror doesn't really cut it
29/05/2018, 23:08 - Rob;: You do have to admire the Mail and Sun's techniques and audacity. Just having the sheer balls to know your readers will swallow it
29/05/2018, 23:13 - Stefan;: Grotbag Left sounds like a slur for Corbyn supporters that they'd immediately adopt as a badge of honour
29/05/2018, 23:14 - Stefan;: Grotbags for Jeremy
30/05/2018, 16:25 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
30/05/2018, 16:46 - Stefan;: They're in a group with Prussia and the Ottoman Empire
30/05/2018, 16:46 - Stefan;: Is anyone planning to drive up to Wales on the Saturday instead of Friday?
30/05/2018, 16:48 - Phill: >still talking about Brexit and not just passively bending over and taking it like a good old fashioned buggering
30/05/2018, 16:51 - Damian Rumble: Ken yeh net git the time af work Stefan lad?
30/05/2018, 16:51 - Phill: *deleting intensifies*
30/05/2018, 16:52 - Phill: *>not bolding everything*
30/05/2018, 16:54 - Stefan;: It's because of my dad's birthday dinner - Friday might be the only day everyone can do
30/05/2018, 16:54 - Paul Dickinson: >still celebrating birthdays
30/05/2018, 16:57 - Phill: https://www.facebook.com/LADbibleAustralia/videos/1639560116176871/
30/05/2018, 16:59 - Paul Dickinson: Colon crusher
30/05/2018, 17:11 - David;: Can't believe that means more to you than shelving ket and boiling your own piss
30/05/2018, 17:15 - Rob;: Bring Yann and the girls along, bet they'd love Wales
30/05/2018, 17:18 - Stefan;: My mum would be mad for it
30/05/2018, 17:19 - Stefan;: Lol what the actual fuck http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-44307611
30/05/2018, 17:21 - Rob;: In answer to Damo's earlier question about staying an extra two days, I probably won't, even if it means having to get a train all the way back (or getting a lift to Oxfordshire then a train if that's an option)
30/05/2018, 17:22 - Rob;: Not sure if we have the Cwm that long anyway
30/05/2018, 17:22 - David;: I am going thursday to tuesday probably
30/05/2018, 17:23 - Rob;: Ah, Thursday. Didn't know we had that too
30/05/2018, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: Hang on. I thought we only had it from Friday??
30/05/2018, 17:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Finish work at 8pm Thursday so was going to go fri-weds
30/05/2018, 17:24 - Damian Rumble: I was planning on driving up Friday morning.
30/05/2018, 17:24 - David;: Ah yeah in fact 13th is friday. Okay i will go fri-weds as well
30/05/2018, 17:24 - Phill: Yeah, was going to head up Friday AM with Dickinson

30/05/2018, 17:27 - David;: Which is what i will probs do. 5 nights, classic
30/05/2018, 17:27 - David;: You can sink into that
30/05/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Might have to john back on the Tuesday, will see
30/05/2018, 17:29 - Stefan;: Thanks Damian - looks like we're doing the dinner after Wales, so Friday morning should work for me
30/05/2018, 17:30 - Rob;: Cheers Damo
30/05/2018, 17:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Thanks for the offer damo, I'm going to drive to chippy Thursday night so me and Dave will take a car up from there Friday morning
30/05/2018, 17:33 - Hamish Sinclair: *from lemington not chippy
30/05/2018, 17:34 - Paul Dickinson: Get ourselves an early start again Phil?
30/05/2018, 17:34 - David;: Woke
30/05/2018, 17:35 - Rob;: Citizens Caine
30/05/2018, 17:37 - Rob;: Are we going to Catan again?
30/05/2018, 17:38 - David;: Yeah yeah. Wheats back on the menu
30/05/2018, 17:56 - Phill: Yeah early
30/05/2018, 17:56 - Phill: There for breakfast
30/05/2018, 17:57 - Damian Rumble: And coke
30/05/2018, 18:00 - Phill: >implying that isn't the breakfast
30/05/2018, 18:07 - Phill: Just got a bottle of red from Majestic and the guy behind the counter told me to guess how much I've spent in there ever
30/05/2018, 18:08 - Phill: Guessed about ¬£500
30/05/2018, 18:08 - Phill: Actual spend close to ¬£1700
30/05/2018, 18:09 - David;: Great sales tactic. Shame you into feeling like an alcoholic
30/05/2018, 18:18 - David;: Rob are you coming to phils for world cup? If so bring the jules chippet so i can get it emgraved before wales
30/05/2018, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: And then drink piss/wine from it
30/05/2018, 18:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Phil over what period is that wine spend?
30/05/2018, 18:20 - Phill: Like 3 years
30/05/2018, 19:22 - Rob;: You have some kind of loyalty card I guess for them to know
30/05/2018, 19:29 - Phill: You'd think so but you get nothing for loyalty there
30/05/2018, 19:29 - Paul Dickinson: Just a running total
30/05/2018, 19:30 - Phill: They just know all their customers are addicted to.booze to a certain degree
30/05/2018, 19:30 - Phill: So don't need to incentivise
30/05/2018, 19:30 - David;: Just the aggregated sum of all your sorrows. Reported every transaction
30/05/2018, 19:30 - Rob;: But how do they have an exact figure of what you've spent?
30/05/2018, 19:31 - Phill: Because you do have an account thing
30/05/2018, 19:31 - Phill: But it doesn't involve money off or anything
30/05/2018, 19:31 - Phill: It's more of a tool for them to profile your drinking habits
30/05/2018, 19:31 - Phill: And market certain booze to you
30/05/2018, 19:31 - David;: Ha, all the data with no incentive
30/05/2018, 19:31 - Rob;: Just a data mine for them with no benefit to you, the man at the coal face
30/05/2018, 19:31 - Phill: Pretty much
30/05/2018, 19:32 - David;: GDPR will be all over that
30/05/2018, 19:32 - Phill: Then they invite you to wine tasting nights (free) where you get free wine
30/05/2018, 19:32 - Phill: But obviously you need to drive to the shop
30/05/2018, 19:32 - Phill: So it's a a bit gash
30/05/2018, 19:32 - Paul Dickinson: Get you hooked on even more
30/05/2018, 19:33 - Paul Dickinson: Here have some free heroin
30/05/2018, 19:36 - David;: 'It's the sort you like'
30/05/2018, 19:37 - Rob;: 'one bump isn't so much. You'll be alright to get yourself home, won't you'
30/05/2018, 19:37 - David;: 'You bought a sheet of acid blotters. If you like that, you may love 2cb'
30/05/2018, 19:39 - Rob;: Customers who bought Beaujolais Villages also bought pice
30/05/2018, 19:39 - Rob;: *spice
30/05/2018, 19:39 - Phill: Apparently my most bought is Pinot
30/05/2018, 19:39 - Phill: Shock
30/05/2018, 19:39 - Phill: Saw some cunt passed out in the middle of the road earlier in Cardiff with a spice joint hanging out his gob
30/05/2018, 19:40 - Phill: Can't believe I dabbled in that shit at uni
30/05/2018, 19:40 - Phill: Disgrace
30/05/2018, 19:40 - Paul Dickinson: >smoking spice
30/05/2018, 19:41 - Rob;: Isn't is extremely hazy and unclean?
30/05/2018, 19:41 - Rob;: Like huffing nutmeg
30/05/2018, 19:41 - Phill: It's rank
30/05/2018, 19:41 - Rob;: I once found an error in a recipe where the nutmeg had been increased to a level that would get you fucking high, and perhaps  kill a child
30/05/2018, 19:41 - Phill: Just feels like you've smoked about 20 joints in 2 seconds but also taken some crack
30/05/2018, 19:43 - Paul Dickinson: How much nutmeg were they recommending?
30/05/2018, 19:44 - Paul Dickinson: Surely you try a bit and go that‚Äôs a shit load of nutmeg and stop eating it
30/05/2018, 19:45 - Paul Dickinson: Or always plough on regardless. The recipe called for dog shit but I think it might be a typo. I‚Äôve made it and it tastes terrible but I must eat it all
30/05/2018, 19:46 - Rob;: Well yeah it would make it horrible
30/05/2018, 19:48 - Rob;: It was mean to serve 6 but the designer had copied an old lapout and it said 2. Then 2 tsp had been mistakenly changed to 2 tbsp
30/05/2018, 19:49 - Rob;: 3 tbsp is apparently lethal for an adult, I think one might get you high
30/05/2018, 19:49 - Paul Dickinson: FYI - Also we need to get high off benzo interactions with grapefruit
30/05/2018, 22:20 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
30/05/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
30/05/2018, 23:01 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
31/05/2018, 12:17 - Sam;: ZIDANE
31/05/2018, 12:20 - Phill: Makes losing even more annoying because it just shows they don't really give a fuck about it
31/05/2018, 12:23 - Rob;: How many managers have won he European cup three times?
31/05/2018, 12:23 - Phill: 3
31/05/2018, 12:23 - Phill: Ancelloti and paisley
31/05/2018, 12:24 - Phill: However Zidane only on in history to win 3 on the trot
31/05/2018, 12:24 - Rob;: Yeah, in 2.5 seasons
31/05/2018, 12:24 - Phill: NOT GOOD ENOUGH
31/05/2018, 12:40 - Sam;: Big news keeps coming . Nike have unveiled the new ball for next season
31/05/2018, 12:45 - Paul Dickinson: Ian paisley?
31/05/2018, 12:46 - Rob;: NO NO NO
31/05/2018, 12:49 - Rob;: Any indications of what the world cup ball might be like?
31/05/2018, 12:49 - Rob;: Remember the 2010 South Africa one that ruined goal keepers?
31/05/2018, 12:50 - Sam;: It‚Äôs already out.
31/05/2018, 12:50 - Rob;: Built in favour of strikers yet resulting in an incredibly low scoring tournament
31/05/2018, 12:51 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
31/05/2018, 12:52 - Rob;: I like the 8-bit design
31/05/2018, 12:53 - Sam;: Would‚Äôve liked a few coloured pixels. Monochrome for the lads I guess
31/05/2018, 12:53 - Damian Rumble: Mahrez to man city??
31/05/2018, 12:54 - Sam;: We‚Äôre drowning in rumours at the moment, but they did come close to signing him in jan
31/05/2018, 13:19 - Rob;: BBC seem convinced
31/05/2018, 13:19 - Phill: My dick to your mum's arsehole confirmed
31/05/2018, 13:22 - David;: A european cup/european season ratio of more than 1
31/05/2018, 13:37 - Jack G;: Would be funny if Zidane just never took another job
31/05/2018, 15:02 - Paul Dickinson: The Telstar
31/05/2018, 15:03 - Paul Dickinson: Name of the pub up in billingham
31/05/2018, 15:03 - Paul Dickinson: Must have named the ball after that
31/05/2018, 15:05 - Rob;: The pub is a major sponsor I believe
31/05/2018, 17:31 - Damian Rumble: I just got Nigeria in the work sweepstake.
31/05/2018, 17:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Great kit this yeat
31/05/2018, 17:31 - Paul Dickinson: Very liberal of you
31/05/2018, 18:17 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
31/05/2018, 18:23 - Rob;: Torn loyalties, do I support the Windies, whom this is a charity benefit for, or the World XI, being a member of the world?
31/05/2018, 18:26 - Paul Dickinson: Just start some aggressive barmy army chants
31/05/2018, 18:27 - David;: If you were from the west indies you couldn't lose. Because you live in the world as well
31/05/2018, 18:29 - Rob;: Nassa Hussein is on the pitch in front of us arbitrarily making us drink
31/05/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: Embarrassed to live in the world tbh. Wickets tumbling with no score
31/05/2018, 20:04 - Phill: Rob/Dave/sambo just finished detectorists, need something similar
31/05/2018, 20:06 - Rob;: Not similar at all, but Derry Girls was good
31/05/2018, 20:07 - Rob;: Not the teen girl thing it looks like
31/05/2018, 20:18 - Sam;: Fail army on YouTube?
31/05/2018, 20:19 - Phill: <Media omitted>
31/05/2018, 20:21 - Paul Dickinson: Look at him
31/05/2018, 20:21 - Paul Dickinson: Fair weather fan
31/05/2018, 20:25 - Phill: He put it on just after villa lost the play off final
31/05/2018, 20:37 - Sam;: I had to jinx the shirt
31/05/2018, 20:37 - Sam;: Worked a treat
31/05/2018, 20:37 - Sam;: Karius home
31/05/2018, 21:02 - Damian Rumble: If we were still on Facebook then I would 'haha' that photo
01/06/2018, 09:53 - Rob;: My friend Freddie pays for things exclusively via his phone, which requires his thumbprint to authorize. He cut his thumb cutting some images out yesterday and had it covered in plaster so I had to pay for stuff
01/06/2018, 09:54 - Rob;: It led us to develop a Kafkaesque future where medical care has been completely privatised and the only way to have your severed thumb sewn back on is to pay for the procedure up front using a thumb you no longer have
01/06/2018, 09:55 - Rob;: I don't even think we're that far away from it
01/06/2018, 10:00 - Damian Rumble: I have that on my phone but I have more than one finger registered by the device...
01/06/2018, 10:01 - Rob;: I queried this and he said only one was possible on his, although that is probably just an oversight on his part
01/06/2018, 17:27 - Rob;: Harry Potter and the Dollgellau Hallows
01/06/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Don't you mean Harry Slotter?
01/06/2018, 17:38 - Rob;: That's the one
02/06/2018, 00:42 - / James Ball: üåö look at this fucker
02/06/2018, 00:42 - / James Ball: üåö
02/06/2018, 00:42 - / James Ball: Minstrel face
02/06/2018, 13:32 - David;: Like the moon from mighty boosch
02/06/2018, 13:34 - David;: Rob - developing that scenario - so rich people's fingers get highly prized as the most valuable thing in the world and they get amputated and sold on black markets i suppose?
02/06/2018, 13:35 - Rob;: I suppose they might
02/06/2018, 13:36 - David;: You could have a flesh coloured glove you slide on but that has a richer persons fingerprint overlaid onto yours so you can impersonate them and go on huge shopping sprees
02/06/2018, 13:36 - Rob;: Which would necessitate the invention of a glove that held their finger in place in a natural position while hiding one of yours so the cashier wouldn't see it was stolen
02/06/2018, 13:36 - Rob;: Ah, snap
02/06/2018, 13:37 - David;: Yeah yeah
 Because just carrying around a severed bloody  finger and daubing it onto payment systems is quite suspicious
02/06/2018, 14:33 - Rob;: World famous guitarists who wear away their finger prints would have no way of spending their vast wealth
03/06/2018, 19:46 - David;: <Media omitted>
03/06/2018, 19:46 - David;: >frowsty
03/06/2018, 21:13 - Rob;: The W always makes it seem very arcahic and fussy. Glad we gave it a modern, Germanic edge
03/06/2018, 21:14 - Rob;: A very frousty fucking periwig

04/06/2018, 09:08 - Damian Rumble: Though reading a little further into the article it seems they plan to expand beyond the original trilogy.... Just as long as they don't go full Hobbit on this....
04/06/2018, 09:16 - Rob;: With lower production values it might be less wanky than teh Hobbits
04/06/2018, 10:02 - David;: Do you already have a sticker for sergio ramos Rob?
04/06/2018, 10:03 - David;: I'd quite like a commission for that one

04/06/2018, 10:15 - Damian Rumble: Put that in the Louvre
04/06/2018, 10:28 - David;: <Media omitted>
04/06/2018, 10:35 - David;: That's the basic design. I've gone for a more satirical angle.
04/06/2018, 10:35 - David;: I can redraw to your specifications if needed
04/06/2018, 10:37 - Phill: Love the Japs eye on the head
04/06/2018, 10:37 - Phill: 10/10
04/06/2018, 10:41 - Rob;: If you can fit it in the template I'll stick it in
04/06/2018, 10:41 - David;: What's the template?
04/06/2018, 10:45 - Rob;: You can print it from here
04/06/2018, 10:45 - Rob;: https://docs.google.com/document/d/12AKl3PDjC_sDdY9WJNJBssWeBuMb1Hsn5WoiJK7-Fxw/edit?usp=drivesdk

04/06/2018, 15:01 - David;: Another one for you rob. I spent a lot of time on this one so i really hope you include it.
04/06/2018, 15:03 - Paul Dickinson: Oh yeah what has been happening with pogba has he just rotted away?
04/06/2018, 15:04 - David;: Its all there in the picture, you shouldn't need to do any more research
04/06/2018, 15:05 - Paul Dickinson: But it is great they thought it best to buy him back
04/06/2018, 15:05 - David;: For a world record fee
04/06/2018, 15:06 - David;: a mark up of 90m quid
04/06/2018, 15:06 - Paul Dickinson: Very embarrassing

04/06/2018, 15:06 - David;: Not even in the France team.
04/06/2018, 15:07 - Paul Dickinson: Man utd; a study in being completely shit. A novel based on a true story, in 2 parts
04/06/2018, 18:18 - Paul Dickinson: That japs eye. Modern classic
04/06/2018, 20:57 - Phill: Why did you whiteface pogba? Racist.
04/06/2018, 21:41 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/06/2018, 21:45 - David;: <Media omitted>
04/06/2018, 21:45 - David;: You're right, this is less racist
04/06/2018, 21:47 - Rob;: I coloured in the first black player I did and immediately regretted it
04/06/2018, 21:47 - David;: Just need to add the gollywog eyes and teeth now
04/06/2018, 21:48 - Rob;: Fried chicken and a slice of watermelon. If you don't then you're more racist
04/06/2018, 21:50 - David;: Without a heap of bannana skins and a coconut it's just whitewashing
04/06/2018, 22:06 - Damian Rumble: Loris Karius: Liverpool keeper concussed during Champions League final - doctors - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44363648
04/06/2018, 22:07 - Damian Rumble: One guess as to who might be the culprit for this??
04/06/2018, 22:08 - Rob;: Lol the amount of "inverted commas" in that
04/06/2018, 22:08 - Paul Dickinson: Nice try lolerpool
04/06/2018, 22:09 - Rob;: Have they employed Trump's doctor to say this?
04/06/2018, 22:09 - Paul Dickinson: The propaganda machine churning away
04/06/2018, 22:32 - David;: Concussion is a very serious issue these days. Glad the truth has come to the surface at last.
04/06/2018, 22:41 - David;: #justiceforlorius
04/06/2018, 23:05 - Paul Dickinson: Arrange a little replay?
04/06/2018, 23:33 - David;: The concussion was also caused by Ramos. Hurricane Ramos.
04/06/2018, 23:34 - David;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bg4ZqHvUTa8
04/06/2018, 23:35 - David;: A real cunt
04/06/2018, 23:36 - Paul Dickinson: Barely touched him
05/06/2018, 00:04 - Damian Rumble: I think the term 'cunt' is often overused here... Especially when describing footballers.... But in this case Ramos thoroughly deserves it. In rugby you'd get cited and banned for this.
05/06/2018, 09:50 - David;: Fellaini to Arsenal.
05/06/2018, 09:51 - David;: Emery going full moyes if that happens
05/06/2018, 09:52 - David;: It's like you just have to buy fellaini to get over a long-term manager
05/06/2018, 11:01 - Rob;: I know
05/06/2018, 11:01 - Rob;: What is this
05/06/2018, 11:02 - Rob;: There was an anonymous quote from someone inside the club that the policy this summer is to buy 'men'
05/06/2018, 11:02 - Rob;: Which basically seems to translate to cheap ageing bastards
05/06/2018, 11:03 - Rob;: I dream of a team of cloggers
05/06/2018, 13:28 - David;: You basically want anyone who is the opposite of Ozil
05/06/2018, 13:29 - David;: 'Get me the player least like Ozil in world football'
05/06/2018, 19:28 - Damian Rumble: Over the last few weeks my inbox has been flooded by emails from the lib Dems regarding the Lewisham by election coming up. Apparently we think we have a chance of getting a 'good' result there. Given that only last year labour won with 68% and we only managed a measly 4.4% I'm really struggling to see why we're bothering... That said it's not exactly a high bar...
05/06/2018, 19:49 - David;: Probably based on remain voting figures and labour's ambivalence?
07/06/2018, 11:54 - Sam;: Fuck. Amazon getting PL games from season after next. Hopefully they‚Äôll include it with prime members
07/06/2018, 11:55 - Sam;: Confirmed: prime uk users will get it. They‚Äôve got 20 pl games
07/06/2018, 11:55 - Rob;: That'd be fucking great
07/06/2018, 11:55 - Rob;: Who's lost the, Sky or BT?
07/06/2018, 11:55 - Rob;: Hoping Sky as I have a by log in
07/06/2018, 11:55 - Jack G;: Will they get big games though?
07/06/2018, 11:56 - Jack G;: Or Fulham vs Huddersfield?
07/06/2018, 11:56 - Rob;: You support West Ham Jack...
07/06/2018, 11:56 - Sam;: Too early to stay which exact game yet of course. BT will have 52 games. Haven‚Äôt found out skys number yet
07/06/2018, 16:22 - Rob;: So they've bought all 10 matches in one bank holiday
07/06/2018, 16:22 - Rob;: And all 10 in a midweek round of fixtures
07/06/2018, 16:22 - Rob;: Quite a fun idea
07/06/2018, 16:23 - Rob;: Will surely just drive people to buy one month of prime, or take out a free trial
07/06/2018, 16:23 - Hamish Sinclair: They'll hopefully play it like bt sport do with the cl group stages where you have several matches going on at once
07/06/2018, 16:23 - Rob;: Just an advert for their other streaming offering I guess
07/06/2018, 16:24 - Rob;: Doubt many matches will go on at once, as you have to move them from 3pm Saturday to legally show them, so they'd have the choice of when to schedule them.

08/06/2018, 12:29 - David;: We still have some excuses to cling onto: too many foreign players; not enough chances for youngsters; intensity of premier league matches; they are all spoiled superstars; media climate and negativity; unrealistic expectations; climate; lack of good coaches
08/06/2018, 12:31 - David;: Oh plus: club rivalries taken into national team; small countries want it more
08/06/2018, 12:31 - Rob;: Ah good
08/06/2018, 12:34 - Rob;: Funny that we can't cope with club rivalries but countries like Spain acan compete with genuine ethnic divisions forged through hundreds of years of oppression
08/06/2018, 12:42 - David;: Surely the main problem is english players not going abroad rather than foreign players coming to England. Because that happens in the top clubs of Spain/Germany but they have spanish and german players in the prem/italy/france etc. to select from still

08/06/2018, 12:52 - Phill: Try playing arrogance and getting the knives out you cunt
08/06/2018, 12:52 - Sam;: Lol.
08/06/2018, 12:52 - Sam;: If we don‚Äôt get to the quarters we shit
08/06/2018, 12:53 - David;: Was thinking the other day how much of it is just down to being shite at pennos. Of the 11 major tournaments since 96 (so when we started knowing about it), we've only not qualified for 1 (08). Then we've only failed to make it out of the group twice (00 (where we beat Germany but still fucked it), 14 (which was in group with Uruguay and Italy)). Of the remaining 8 tournaments where we reached the knock out stage, 5 have been lost on penalty shootouts, the other 2 being losses to Brazil in 02 (who went on to win it) and Germany in 10. so Iceland stands out as the only time we've lost to a shite team at the knock out stages.
08/06/2018, 12:54 - David;: In other words 45% of the time we are knocked out on penalties
08/06/2018, 12:54 - Sam;: Rekt
08/06/2018, 13:49 - Damian Rumble: Thing is that if I manage any team playing England in the knockout. I know all I need to do is grind out a nil nil for a gaurenteed win on pens
08/06/2018, 18:30 - Rob;: William Hill are offering an interesting bet, ¬£10 on a team outright and you get a ¬£5 bet for every game they win
08/06/2018, 18:31 - Rob;: Ao you could get 6 free ¬£5 bets if your team gets to the final
08/06/2018, 18:31 - Rob;: An accountant friend is convinced she's guaranteed to make at least some money with her combination of bets
08/06/2018, 18:33 - Rob;: But I was thinking of signing up to two sites that give you a free ¬£10 bet, betting ¬£10 each on Brazil and Germany outright, then putting my free bets eachway on 3rd and 4th favourites
08/06/2018, 20:26 - David;: But with the free ¬£10 dont you also have to put money in?
08/06/2018, 21:27 - Rob;: Yeah you do, but the difference is that you definitely get ¬£10 in free bets, compared to William Hill's ¬£5 per win offer, which could be more, could be zero
08/06/2018, 22:31 - David;: Who do you think?
08/06/2018, 22:32 - David;: I mean, Brazil look pretty fucking good.
08/06/2018, 22:33 - David;: Reckon not Germany. Not Spain. France or Brazil.
08/06/2018, 22:36 - David;: Apparently Uruguay have a lot of good young players coming through. Outside shout
08/06/2018, 22:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Brazil or Germany surely
08/06/2018, 22:46 - David;: Germany squad actually doesnt look thay great to me. Where are the goals?
08/06/2018, 22:46 - David;: Also the butt hurt over Gundogan and Ozil with the Turkish president
08/06/2018, 22:47 - David;: I'm saying Brazil. Stupid forward line
08/06/2018, 22:47 - Paul Dickinson: Leaky defense still though?
08/06/2018, 22:48 - David;: Weeeeel, your thiago silva's, your marcelo's, your marquinhos' Ederson or allison in goal.
08/06/2018, 22:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Germany have gomez upfront who will basically do a lahm and score shit loads
08/06/2018, 22:50 - Hamish Sinclair: They always stick an 30-odd year old fox In the box in the team for tournaments
08/06/2018, 22:50 - Hamish Sinclair: *klose not lahm
08/06/2018, 22:50 - Paul Dickinson: What‚Äôs the latest on ü•ó
08/06/2018, 22:51 - David;: Also Brazil have casemiro and fernandinho shielding the defence.
08/06/2018, 22:51 - David;: No holes anywhere really
08/06/2018, 22:52 - Paul Dickinson: But the 7-1
08/06/2018, 22:52 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôd 7-1 to be a Brazilian
08/06/2018, 22:53 - David;: Looks like Salah will start at least a couple of the group stage matches. Might miss the first game, but they will probably inject him with painkillers until he doesnt know he even has a shoulder
09/06/2018, 00:35 - Rob;: Drew them in the work sweepstake, quite pleased as I set it up and included a prize for 3rd so have a chance
09/06/2018, 00:36 - Rob;: I like France player-wise
09/06/2018, 00:36 - Rob;: But will they just fall out with eachother?
09/06/2018, 00:37 - Rob;: Brazil are hard to look past. Will feel like they have something to prove after last time
09/06/2018, 00:39 - David;: Yeah. Brazil
09/06/2018, 00:39 - David;: I've heard they do football
09/06/2018, 00:40 - Rob;: Will Belgium ever donanything?
09/06/2018, 00:40 - Rob;: Not don anything
09/06/2018, 00:40 - Rob;: They'll don their kit
09/06/2018, 00:40 - David;: Could be the year it clicks, they are the right age
09/06/2018, 00:40 - Rob;: Do. Do anything
09/06/2018, 00:41 - Rob;: I think we have a quarter final in us. I'm saying it.
09/06/2018, 00:42 - David;: But can't see past them always being shit. Hazard, Lukaku, De Bruyne is a decent little outfit though
09/06/2018, 00:42 - David;: Yeah i think quarters, restore some pride then lose on penalties. Classic
09/06/2018, 01:00 - Rob;: But with a decent defence and keeper too. Possibly the best first XI
09/06/2018, 01:01 - David;: Issue with full backs? But yeah decent. What date do we play them?
09/06/2018, 01:02 - David;: I have this weird feeling we could do okay as they all play in the prem. No unknown quantities
09/06/2018, 01:02 - Rob;: Vertongan at left back is alright, who do they play leftM
09/06/2018, 01:02 - Rob;: 28th, last group game
09/06/2018, 01:02 - Rob;: Huge game
09/06/2018, 01:03 - David;: Could be massive
09/06/2018, 01:03 - Rob;: Watching in the British embassy to Belgium bar with Steve
09/06/2018, 01:03 - David;: In belgium?
09/06/2018, 01:04 - Rob;: Yeah yeah yeah
09/06/2018, 01:04 - David;: Nah
09/06/2018, 01:04 - Rob;: Yeah
09/06/2018, 01:04 - David;: Going specifically for the match?
09/06/2018, 01:06 - Rob;: A 4 day holiday to hang out with a mate during the world cup, but timed for that, yeah
09/06/2018, 01:07 - David;: Yeah nice. Weird sense incwhich you'd rather there was something at stake but that would require us fucking up first
09/06/2018, 01:08 - Rob;: Would imagine qualifying 1st or 2nd will rest on it, unless one side draws or loses a match
09/06/2018, 01:08 - David;: Do we already know who we will play if we finish 1st/2nd?
09/06/2018, 01:09 - Rob;: Don't think so
09/06/2018, 01:09 - David;: Like which group
09/06/2018, 01:09 - Rob;: Would probably affect bookies too much
09/06/2018, 01:10 - David;: But rob eriksen sent a little tweet to alli saying 'see you in the semi finals'. How would he know?
09/06/2018, 01:11 - Rob;: Who is Rob Eriksen?
09/06/2018, 01:13 - Rob;: Actually, we do know

09/06/2018, 01:14 - Rob;: We'd play group H
09/06/2018, 01:15 - Rob;: Japan, Senegal, Colombia or Poland
09/06/2018, 01:16 - David;: Ah that's ideal
09/06/2018, 01:16 - Rob;: Yeah
09/06/2018, 01:16 - David;: A big fucking vacuum of nothingness
09/06/2018, 01:17 - Rob;: For our ego to get sucked off by
09/06/2018, 01:19 - Rob;: Quarters would be teams for E or F
09/06/2018, 01:19 - Rob;: F has Germany
09/06/2018, 01:20 - David;: Ah and e has brazil
09/06/2018, 01:20 - David;: So quarters then
09/06/2018, 01:20 - Rob;: Yeah
09/06/2018, 01:20 - Rob;: I wish it was drawn after the group stage
09/06/2018, 01:21 - Rob;: Quite shit knowing this now

Modern students 'prefer work to drugs' - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-44443349
12/06/2018, 07:56 - Phill: These studies are bollocks though
12/06/2018, 07:57 - Phill: 1. I reckon a good percentage of people lie about drug use
12/06/2018, 07:57 - Phill: 2. Only twats actually respond to these surveys anyway
12/06/2018, 07:57 - Phill: 3. People coming down off a mad one aren't going to have the mental capacity to complete a survey for the university of Buckingham
12/06/2018, 07:58 - Rob;: Well yeah there is that. But if they're comparing them to past serveys then at least the survey doers are getting more uptight
12/06/2018, 07:59 - Phill: The results from this survey do not agree with another recent piece of research from the National Union of Students, which suggested that about two in five students were drug users.
12/06/2018, 08:00 - Phill: >not hoovering up drugs all day erry day
12/06/2018, 08:01 - Rob;: Having reached worryingly lazy levels at uni as it was I am quite glad I wasn't eating drugs
12/06/2018, 08:02 - Rob;: But maybe I just needed stimulants
12/06/2018, 08:02 - Phill: Yeah just offset the malaise with a problematic coke addiction
12/06/2018, 08:02 - Rob;: Should have had loads of cocaine, would have got that first

12/06/2018, 13:04 - David;: >rouge state
12/06/2018, 13:06 - David;: Also, I'd bet good money that the student survey thing is being skewed by socially conservative foreign (mainly asian) students who are all about getting a UK degree so they can appease their parents. I.e. I reckon it's largely down to the changing national composition of the student body rather than a change in the attitude of British students.
12/06/2018, 13:07 - Phill: Damo, u mad that Trump is going to win a legit Nobel prize, not like when Obama got one because he's a meme?

12/06/2018, 13:42 - Damian Rumble: It's ironic because weak enforcement was exactly trumps reason for bailing on the Iran deal

12/06/2018, 14:14 - Rob;: On the need to check notes from his meeting:¬†"I have one of the great memories of all time. I don‚Äôt have to do that."

On apologising if things don't go as planned:"I think he's gonna do these things. I may be wrong. I may stand before you in six months and say, hey, I was wrong," he said, before adding: "I don‚Äôt know that I‚Äôll ever admit that. But I‚Äôll find some kind of an excuse."

On why he thinks experts are wrong about denuclearisation taking 15 years:¬†"I think whoever wrote that is wrong... There will be a point at which when you are 20 percent through you can‚Äôt go back. I had an uncle who was a great professor for, I believe, 40 years at MIT. And I used to discuss nuclear with him all the time. He was a great expert. He was a great brilliant genius."

13/06/2018, 15:06 - Jack G;: Sacked their manager the day before the World Cup
13/06/2018, 15:10 - Sam;: Because he had just signed on for the next euros with Spain then instantly went back on it to join Real Madrid after the World Cup. So Spain pied him

14/06/2018, 11:30 - Rob;: Interesting that PSG have to make a ¬£60m transfer profit his year. Could mean a few big moves, especially if they buy big too
14/06/2018, 11:32 - Sam;: It‚Äôs a bit of a saga starting with a poor cup defeat to a lower league team team. 50 fans stormed training and beat the team up. The owner fined the whole squad and now they all want to cancel their contracts. Some PL quality in that squad.

I‚Äôm hoping for a cheeky veratti out of PSG
14/06/2018, 11:32 - Sam;: Um hello. Fixtures announced for next season
14/06/2018, 11:33 - Sam;: Arsenal v city opening day..

15/06/2018, 00:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Clattenburg is a prick
15/06/2018, 01:00 - Hamish Sinclair: That is the story
15/06/2018, 01:00 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm a bit delirious and sleep deprived tbh
15/06/2018, 01:00 - Hamish Sinclair: Bet on Jesse lingard for golden boot earlier
15/06/2018, 01:01 - David;: Ah. Yeah you should get some rest
15/06/2018, 01:01 - David;: What odds?
15/06/2018, 01:01 - David;: Must be decent
15/06/2018, 01:02 - Hamish Sinclair: 250/1
15/06/2018, 01:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Each way pays four places
15/06/2018, 01:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Only needs to have a couple of tap ins against Panama and he's nearly there
15/06/2018, 01:06 - David;: What do you get on Firmino?
15/06/2018, 01:07 - Hamish Sinclair: 66/1
15/06/2018, 01:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Same as radio mane
15/06/2018, 01:08 - David;: that seems great
15/06/2018, 01:08 - David;: might put a tenner on
15/06/2018, 01:08 - Hamish Sinclair: But he doesn't start
15/06/2018, 01:08 - Hamish Sinclair: That's pretty crucial
15/06/2018, 01:08 - David;: he plays his way into the team after first game with jesus anonymous. sorted
15/06/2018, 01:09 - David;: Is it neymar jesus and coutinho?
15/06/2018, 01:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah thinknso
15/06/2018, 01:11 - Paul Dickinson: Jesus anonymous
15/06/2018, 01:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh
15/06/2018, 01:11 - Hamish Sinclair: I've got a few quid on jesus
15/06/2018, 01:11 - Hamish Sinclair: And lukaku
15/06/2018, 01:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Figured he can probably stick 6 in against Panama and tunisia
15/06/2018, 01:11 - Paul Dickinson: Can‚Äôt gamble in the mighty USA state of Illinois
15/06/2018, 01:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Can't you find some Indians?
15/06/2018, 01:12 - Paul Dickinson: Unless you‚Äôre at a racetrack or very specific off track betting place of which there are a handful
15/06/2018, 01:12 - Paul Dickinson: And get the pleasure of paying tax on your winnings
15/06/2018, 01:13 - David;: Realistically it will be some shitty German won't it? What do I get on Julian Brandt for the golden boot?
15/06/2018, 01:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Can't find him
15/06/2018, 01:15 - Hamish Sinclair: But timo werner is 14/1
15/06/2018, 01:15 - Hamish Sinclair: One of the favourites
15/06/2018, 01:15 - David;: Reus?
15/06/2018, 01:15 - David;: probably shit odds
15/06/2018, 01:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Reus a 66/1
15/06/2018, 01:17 - David;: ah okay, there's my tenner
15/06/2018, 01:18 - David;: little marco
15/06/2018, 01:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Go 5quid each way
15/06/2018, 01:18 - David;: What's this each way thing?
15/06/2018, 01:19 - Hamish Sinclair: They pay out a quarter if he finishes within top 4 basicslly
15/06/2018, 01:19 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
15/06/2018, 01:19 - Paul Dickinson: >using a black highlighter
15/06/2018, 01:19 - David;: He's my man
15/06/2018, 01:20 - Paul Dickinson: Remember when you didn‚Äôt get your bet on Greece
15/06/2018, 01:20 - Hamish Sinclair: What happened?
15/06/2018, 01:20 - David;: But you get less good odds each way? There must be some drawback. I just want to purity - 10 pounds, to win the boot. On the nose. No funny business
15/06/2018, 01:20 - David;: Ah yeah
15/06/2018, 01:21 - David;: Well for Euro 2004 I did loads of research before and thought Greece were a good outside shout
15/06/2018, 01:21 - Hamish Sinclair: It costs double to go each way. So 5quid ew cost a 10quif
15/06/2018, 01:21 - David;: 75/1
15/06/2018, 01:21 - David;: Asked Tony to put a bet on for me being under 18. He thought it was too ridiculous so refused to place it.
15/06/2018, 01:22 - David;: Ah yeah but then I only win 330 quid rather than 660 when the inevitable happens. That would seem reckless.
15/06/2018, 01:24 - Paul Dickinson: Just bang it on the nose or boot if you will
15/06/2018, 01:24 - David;: (obviously Greece won that year)
15/06/2018, 01:27 - David;: https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/marco-reus-tipped-to-win-golden-ball-germany-world-cup-2018-cacau-507360.jsp
15/06/2018, 01:28 - David;: Um, hello? May as well start spending the winnings now
15/06/2018, 01:28 - Paul Dickinson: And you‚Äôre getting him at 66/1
15/06/2018, 01:28 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm sold
15/06/2018, 01:28 - David;: A steal
15/06/2018, 01:28 - Paul Dickinson: Try betfair exchange. Even better odds typically
15/06/2018, 01:44 - David;: 66/1 on betfair too. But my betfair account seems fucked. Not accepting my card. What site were you on Hamish?
15/06/2018, 01:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Sky bet
15/06/2018, 01:45 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd recommend not using them
15/06/2018, 07:24 - Rob;: Is this an autocorrect, or is Radio Mane already a chant? Because 'All we hear is, radio Mane' is excellent
15/06/2018, 07:25 - Phill: ALL WE HEAR IS RADIO MANE, RADIO BOBBY, RADIO SALAH
15/06/2018, 12:02 - Paul Dickinson: Do they have a Liverpool chant forum where you can propose new chants
15/06/2018, 12:03 - David;: What song is that?
15/06/2018, 12:04 - Paul Dickinson: Radio ga ga
15/06/2018, 12:04 - David;: Has to be a chant
15/06/2018, 12:08 - Rob;: Who's Raul Moat?
15/06/2018, 12:08 - Paul Dickinson: RADIO RAUL
15/06/2018, 12:09 - Phill: ALL WE HEAR IS RADIO RAOUL, RADIO MOATY, RADIO GAZZA
15/06/2018, 12:10 - Rob;: RADIO CHICKEN
15/06/2018, 12:10 - Rob;: RADIO FISHIN'
15/06/2018, 14:06 - Paul Dickinson: New rule for football. Balls not out until it touches the ground
15/06/2018, 14:06 - Paul Dickinson: You could have some incredible plays in the stands
15/06/2018, 14:07 - Damian Rumble: That's the rule in rugby. It works  very well.
15/06/2018, 14:07 - Phill: You gimp m8? One of the players pubes can be in touch and the ball is dead
15/06/2018, 14:09 - Damian Rumble: As long as the player was in play before they played the ball then it's good.
15/06/2018, 14:10 - Phill: Not the same as the ball not touching the ground
15/06/2018, 14:15 - Paul Dickinson: Headers and volleys from the back of the stands just to set up a good cross
15/06/2018, 14:15 - Paul Dickinson: Best players are those who can nimbly acrobat across searing
15/06/2018, 14:15 - Paul Dickinson: *seating
15/06/2018, 14:17 - David;: So could do keeoy ups around the back of the goal to the other side?
15/06/2018, 14:17 - David;: If you get fouled behind the goal is it a penno?
15/06/2018, 14:20 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah can do keepy ups. No, no pennos or free kicks
15/06/2018, 14:21 - Paul Dickinson: Would go for a corner
15/06/2018, 14:22 - David;: Could team member actually stay outside the stadoum and recieve a very long ball over the stands and would have to control it without it dropping and then return with abother huge punt
15/06/2018, 14:22 - David;: But, you'd get the element of surprise that tye other team doesnt know where the ball would come back in from
15/06/2018, 14:23 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah that would be one of the new tactics
15/06/2018, 14:25 - David;: Would like to also see a workd class professional game played on an infinitely wide field with no throw ins. See what tactics develop and how they deal with it
15/06/2018, 14:25 - David;: Like at school
15/06/2018, 14:25 - Paul Dickinson: Infinitely wide
15/06/2018, 14:26 - Paul Dickinson: He‚Äôs ran to Southampton
15/06/2018, 14:27 - David;: Yeah fine - as long as it didnt go behind the goal lines. They stretch out to infinity as well
15/06/2018, 14:29 - Paul Dickinson: Or if you go beyond the goal line an explosive collar goes off every player is forced to wear. Makes it tense. Don‚Äôt stray too far out of sight of where you know the goal line is
15/06/2018, 14:30 - David;: Yeah yeah. Generally more explosive collars would improve things
15/06/2018, 14:30 - David;: For off-sides, minor infringements
15/06/2018, 14:31 - Paul Dickinson: Stops it just descending into a farce if anything
15/06/2018, 14:32 - David;: Or playing on past 90 minutes if you are behind is allowed but every minute that passes generates a higher likelyhood all the teams collars will be triggered
15/06/2018, 14:32 - David;: So a steadily increasing but random chance and you have to balance that against how much you want the result
15/06/2018, 14:33 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
15/06/2018, 14:56 - Rob;: Remember getting Fraped?
15/06/2018, 14:57 - Rob;: That's all gone now. No one's fraping these days
15/06/2018, 14:59 - David;: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

New upskirting law blocked by Tory MP - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44496427
15/06/2018, 14:59 - David;: >Sir Christophern Chope
15/06/2018, 14:59 - David;: Grotty Chope
15/06/2018, 14:59 - David;: Gropey Chopey
15/06/2018, 15:02 - David;: Curious thing to take a stand against
15/06/2018, 15:32 - Damian Rumble: It's because most people access Facebook on thier phones now (which are less likely to be left unattended)
15/06/2018, 15:38 - Paul Dickinson: Are you going to go out and have a big afternoon of upskirting?
15/06/2018, 15:40 - David;: Its my natural right as an englishman to upskirt. Written into magna carta
15/06/2018, 15:42 - Paul Dickinson: Big night with the lads. Tinnies and upskirting
15/06/2018, 15:43 - Sam;: Prefer a challenge these days. Updress. Uptrouser.
15/06/2018, 15:44 - David;: Upskin

15/06/2018, 16:03 - David;: Mad night of upskirting round Chopey's place
15/06/2018, 17:15 - Rob;: It's been a little unfair that four of the majority Muslim nations at he world cup have played yesterday or today when it was Ramadan until today
15/06/2018, 17:16 - Rob;: Must have fucked preparation of they all observe it
15/06/2018, 17:17 - Sam;: No nation can have special treatment. It‚Äôs their choice to prepare sportsmen by not letting them even drink water
15/06/2018, 17:17 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
15/06/2018, 17:18 - Rob;: Agree, but it's definitely quite unfortunate
15/06/2018, 17:19 - Sam;: Oh yeah no question. At least they‚Äôre used it. Not their first Ramadan
15/06/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: England get 4 extra days of drinking water that they don't even need
15/06/2018, 17:21 - Rob;: An A&E nurse friend told me she hates Ramadan because she has to send away loads of people who've just tried to eat thhe three meals they've missed really quickly and feel really sick
15/06/2018, 17:21 - Rob;: Not their dirt Ramadan either but still fucking it up
15/06/2018, 17:22 - Rob;: *first
15/06/2018, 17:22 - Sam;: lol. Pace yourself lads
15/06/2018, 17:23 - Rob;: Like your big curry from Wales
15/06/2018, 17:23 - Rob;: Bug enough to deflect a humongous dose of psychedelics and stimulants
15/06/2018, 17:23 - Sam;: Just too big a curry ..
15/06/2018, 17:28 - Damian Rumble: Sam needs to observe Ramadan at Wales in preparation for the bloot
15/06/2018, 17:33 - Sam;: Lol yeah, simply dissolved
15/06/2018, 18:53 - Rob;: Is Iago Aspas the greatest example of the Liverpool shitening factor? A counterpoint to Salah
15/06/2018, 18:53 - Rob;: I didn't expect to see him in the Spain squad
16/06/2018, 16:00 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
17/06/2018, 16:46 - Sam;: Germany looking a bit shit
17/06/2018, 16:47 - David;: Yeah this is great
17/06/2018, 16:47 - Paul Dickinson: Dumpney
17/06/2018, 16:47 - David;: Looking very open at the back for a german side
17/06/2018, 16:47 - Paul Dickinson: Dumpany
17/06/2018, 16:47 - David;: Germano
17/06/2018, 16:47 - David;: Germanot
17/06/2018, 16:56 - Sam;: Midfield looking slow. Mexico burning rubber on dem counters
17/06/2018, 16:58 - David;: Southgate just said only 4 other people have plaued for and managed England. Who are they?
17/06/2018, 17:03 - Sam;: Hoddle
17/06/2018, 17:03 - Sam;: Keegan
17/06/2018, 17:05 - Sam;: Bobby robson?
17/06/2018, 17:06 - David;: Yeah. Did venables ever get a grotty little cap?
17/06/2018, 17:06 - David;: Walter winterbottom?
17/06/2018, 17:07 - Sam;: Venables is a good shout

17/06/2018, 20:27 - Paul Dickinson: Shiiiiitttttinoooo
17/06/2018, 20:58 - David;: All favourite's drop points apart from France
17/06/2018, 20:58 - David;: Life
17/06/2018, 21:00 - Rob;: It could actually make finishing first in the group a bit tricky
17/06/2018, 21:01 - David;: But not for us because we know we play group h
17/06/2018, 21:01 - Rob;: Increase the chances of meeting a favourite, who might then suddenly be really good
17/06/2018, 21:01 - David;: So irrelevant
17/06/2018, 21:02 - David;: It could put a slightly stronger team between them and us in the last 16

17/06/2018, 21:33 - Paul Dickinson: Damian brain can‚Äôt compute
17/06/2018, 21:33 - Rob;: He's just the world cup's smallest keeper

18/06/2018, 08:14 - Phill: Just driving up to Scotland, pulled into Keele services for a shit
18/06/2018, 08:14 - Phill: A queue for the shitting

18/06/2018, 13:17 - David;: Managing england got me right up for it. Realising how shit we are. Nothing to lose
18/06/2018, 13:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Capello, such a cunt
18/06/2018, 13:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Sven, lad
18/06/2018, 13:20 - David;: Was getting deep into Germany's historic world cup performance. It's silly. They've got to quarters or better in 17 out of 18 world cups. 67% of the time they get 3rd place or better.
18/06/2018, 13:20 - Sam;: Hoddle the genius. But just couldn‚Äôt leave the disableds alone
18/06/2018, 13:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh, but how much of our performance was down to the faith healet
18/06/2018, 13:21 - Hamish Sinclair: I want terry back. The klopp of the 90s
18/06/2018, 13:21 - David;: Yeah hiddle the one that got away. Sven basically 'sure i was shagging ulrika, what of it?'
18/06/2018, 13:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Sniffing around ulrika
18/06/2018, 13:21 - Hamish Sinclair: üêΩ
18/06/2018, 13:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Listening to 3 lions 98 version, starts with the "Gareth Southgate the whole of England is with you" commentary
18/06/2018, 13:22 - David;: Capello was a cunt. 'Yeah 66 mate, nothing i could do'
18/06/2018, 13:23 - David;: Yeah - the emotion. The resonance
18/06/2018, 13:23 - David;: It would be the perfect redemption story
18/06/2018, 13:29 - Rob;: I've enjoyed Kane's attitude of wanting to get out there to enjoy it and score goals
18/06/2018, 13:30 - Rob;: Not communicating fear
18/06/2018, 15:35 - Sam;: Just watching itv highlights package for yesterday. Slaven Bilic talking about the Switzerland equaliser, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre sounding quite neutral on whether it‚Äôs a foul slaven?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo be fair I don‚Äôt care really‚Äù
18/06/2018, 15:35 - Sam;: Cheers slaven
18/06/2018, 15:35 - Sam;: Getting paid for that
18/06/2018, 17:41 - Sam;: Wolves have snuffled the first truffle from the sporting Lisbon melt down. Rui patricio. Ridiculous for a promoted team to get a keeper like that
18/06/2018, 17:51 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
18/06/2018, 17:51 - Hamish Sinclair: No-one has ever shown me an angle of this shot where it doesn't go in
18/06/2018, 18:18 - David;: >this jinxing of everything
18/06/2018, 18:18 - David;: Why? No chance now, forget it
18/06/2018, 18:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh yehyeh
18/06/2018, 18:19 - Phill: Why the fuck did the BBC do that?
18/06/2018, 18:19 - Sam;: After all the talk of keeping it low key
18/06/2018, 18:20 - Sam;: To only talk us up but put together a highly produced video. Telling the team there‚Äôs no pressure lads, except for the pressure to win the tournament
18/06/2018, 18:21 - Phill: Maguire looks like a Sinclair/Thornton love child
18/06/2018, 18:22 - Hamish Sinclair: A very chinny mug
18/06/2018, 18:22 - Sam;: Lol.
18/06/2018, 18:25 - David;: Hate Capello chucking his way through how shit he was
18/06/2018, 18:25 - David;: *chuckling
18/06/2018, 18:27 - Phill: Sven and Lembit Opik should cowrite a book on how to smash foreign fluff
18/06/2018, 18:28 - David;: Although Sven predominantly smashing a fellow ex-pat?
18/06/2018, 18:29 - Phill: Dat 2006 team. So much quality. So much failure.
18/06/2018, 18:29 - Hamish Sinclair: He equivalent of bug Sam managing Sweden and also smashing Claudia winkelman
18/06/2018, 18:31 - David;: Somehow that would be even grottier
18/06/2018, 18:31 - Phill: Neil Warnock managing Bosnia, smashing Cat Deely
18/06/2018, 18:32 - Phill: "that's fer fuckin muscat that"
18/06/2018, 18:33 - David;: Nice to be playing in biblical conditions
18/06/2018, 18:34 - Paul Dickinson: lol muscat
18/06/2018, 18:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Sliti
18/06/2018, 18:38 - David;: Good that he's not of asian descent. Would be awkward.
18/06/2018, 18:42 - David;: Young>Rose
18/06/2018, 18:43 - David;: Who was rating the training kit? I agree better than home shirt

18/06/2018, 19:04 - Rob;: Jesse
18/06/2018, 19:04 - Phill: Why can't sterling finish ever
18/06/2018, 19:04 - David;: Only for england though
18/06/2018, 19:05 - Phill: He does miss some sitters for city too
18/06/2018, 19:05 - Sam;: We‚Äôre Looking dynamic up front though
18/06/2018, 19:05 - Rob;: He scored loads but with a poor conversion rate for city
18/06/2018, 19:05 - Rob;: Great start anyway
18/06/2018, 19:05 - David;: Yeah, great start
18/06/2018, 19:07 - David;: Fallnisia
18/06/2018, 19:11 - David;: Blarry Dwayne
18/06/2018, 19:11 - Jack G;: Blarry

18/06/2018, 19:12 - Phill: They need feeding!
18/06/2018, 19:12 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
18/06/2018, 19:12 - David;: Not being crushed by butt hurt
18/06/2018, 19:13 - Sam;: Hamish is gallons of pint thrown at the ceiling?
18/06/2018, 19:13 - Hamish Sinclair: This is the ceiling above where I'm stood
18/06/2018, 19:13 - Rob;: Managing in a waistcoat, like you're halfway through a wedding
18/06/2018, 19:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Beer everywhere
18/06/2018, 19:13 - David;: Yeah, got a best man speech to get too afterwards
18/06/2018, 19:13 - Phill: Hoover it up won't you sambo?
18/06/2018, 19:14 - Rob;: 'Stones has headed the keepers' arm off' - Calum
18/06/2018, 19:14 - Sam;: Lol. Sup it up like Kev
18/06/2018, 19:14 - Hamish Sinclair: He's just a shit mo Salah
18/06/2018, 19:15 - Paul Dickinson: Kane the predator
18/06/2018, 19:15 - David;: This particular keeper. Does he know what life is?
18/06/2018, 19:15 - David;: We should just take shots everywhere
18/06/2018, 19:15 - Sam;: Looks totally unprepared
18/06/2018, 19:16 - Sam;: Probably didn‚Äôt think he‚Äôd play a single minute
18/06/2018, 19:16 - Sam;: Just there for the bants
18/06/2018, 19:18 - Sam;: Hendo is having a great game
18/06/2018, 19:18 - Phill: Obviously ...
18/06/2018, 19:18 - David;: Was probably hunting for whatties on tinder on the bench
18/06/2018, 19:18 - Sam;: Someone says get your gloves on and he just says, why?
18/06/2018, 19:19 - Phill: Whatty Cup 2018
18/06/2018, 19:20 - David;: Walker the barn owl
18/06/2018, 19:20 - David;: An angry barn own apoears to be playing at centre back
18/06/2018, 19:26 - David;: Fucking walker
18/06/2018, 19:26 - David;: Why not clear that?
18/06/2018, 19:29 - Sam;: He‚Äôs not looking clever enough for that position. Should let him play right side over trippier
18/06/2018, 19:29 - David;: Um, yes. Hello
18/06/2018, 19:29 - David;: Been saying this
18/06/2018, 19:30 - Sam;: Well now it‚Äôs proven
18/06/2018, 19:31 - David;: Barn owls dont make natural centre backs
18/06/2018, 19:31 - David;: They are more at home swooping for voles
18/06/2018, 19:32 - Sam;: Southgate should know that really
18/06/2018, 19:33 - David;: Ah
18/06/2018, 19:33 - David;: Case in point
18/06/2018, 19:33 - Rob;: Ah maybe
18/06/2018, 19:33 - Rob;: Stupid
18/06/2018, 19:34 - Sam;: Fuck sake
18/06/2018, 19:35 - David;: Yeah. Idiotic
18/06/2018, 19:35 - David;: No danger there
18/06/2018, 19:35 - Phill: >wanker
18/06/2018, 19:36 - David;: Vile wanker
18/06/2018, 19:36 - Sam;: The press won‚Äôt hang him out to dry though of course..
18/06/2018, 19:37 - David;: Ah fuck, alli
18/06/2018, 19:40 - Sam;: Fucking penalty
18/06/2018, 19:41 - David;: We alctually do pressing now at least
18/06/2018, 19:42 - Sam;: Tunisia are a dirty bunch of fuckers
18/06/2018, 19:42 - David;: Lingard! Fucking learn shooting
18/06/2018, 19:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Pings are could have had 4
18/06/2018, 19:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Just saying
18/06/2018, 19:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Lingaard
18/06/2018, 19:46 - Rob;: That's a class touch by lingard though, insanely hard to turn it into a finish too
18/06/2018, 19:46 - David;: Yeah i more meant shot before that one was just unlucky
18/06/2018, 19:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Morally I should be able to cash in right now
18/06/2018, 19:47 - David;: What bet?
18/06/2018, 19:47 - David;: Oh golden boot
18/06/2018, 19:47 - David;: Madness
18/06/2018, 19:48 - Rob;: VARdy would change this
18/06/2018, 19:53 - Sam;: Loving Southgates celebration, not doing a pretend no reaction
18/06/2018, 20:11 - Sam;: Second VAR penno we should have had
18/06/2018, 20:18 - Phill: We're really lacking a coutinho
18/06/2018, 20:18 - Phill: A Silva
18/06/2018, 20:19 - Phill: A kroos
18/06/2018, 20:20 - Sam;: Fuck this ref
18/06/2018, 20:21 - David;: Is this a loftus cheek moment?
18/06/2018, 20:22 - Sam;: Yeah. Strength and guile in the top third to help Kane out . Alli needs to come off
18/06/2018, 20:23 - Rob;: It's starting to get away from us
18/06/2018, 20:23 - Rob;: V A R D Y
18/06/2018, 20:23 - David;: Yeah
18/06/2018, 20:23 - Sam;: Rashford or vardy on for Stirling
18/06/2018, 20:23 - David;: Its not set up for vardy he wont get space
18/06/2018, 20:23 - David;: Rashford or L-C
18/06/2018, 20:24 - Rob;: I feel he could create space though, we need to be more direct
18/06/2018, 20:25 - Sam;: This is where I need some bollocks from Southgate. Change the game
18/06/2018, 20:25 - Rob;: Double change - take off a centre half, get another wide player on and swap Dele or Stirling for VARdy
18/06/2018, 20:27 - Sam;: Thank you jebus
18/06/2018, 20:31 - Sam;: Get alli off NOW
18/06/2018, 20:38 - Phill: Finally
18/06/2018, 20:39 - Sam;: Why can every fan the need for those subs at 60 mins but not the fucking manager.
18/06/2018, 20:39 - Phill: This is the quintessential England FC experience
18/06/2018, 20:40 - Rob;: Already thing he players who aren't on the pitch
18/06/2018, 20:40 - Rob;: *ruing
18/06/2018, 20:40 - Rob;: The ox might have done something
18/06/2018, 20:42 - Sam;: I can‚Äôt do England supporting it‚Äôs too fucking frustrating
18/06/2018, 20:44 - David;: The fucking time wasting
18/06/2018, 20:44 - David;: Ref a flimsy piece of shit that just allows it
18/06/2018, 20:45 - Phill: 10 mins added time surely
18/06/2018, 20:46 - Phill: Dummying for dummies
18/06/2018, 20:47 - Phill: Keown pissing me off
18/06/2018, 20:47 - Phill: MUH TEMPERATURE
18/06/2018, 20:48 - Phill: MUH MIDGES
18/06/2018, 20:48 - Rob;: It's the hope that kills you
18/06/2018, 20:49 - Phill: >4
18/06/2018, 20:50 - Sam;: JUSTICE
18/06/2018, 20:50 - Phill: Hhhhhhoonkkkkkkkk
18/06/2018, 20:50 - Jack G;: Blarry2
18/06/2018, 20:50 - Phill: JUSTICE FOR THE 96
18/06/2018, 20:50 - Phill: JUSTICE FOR GRENFELL
18/06/2018, 20:50 - Rob;: HONKING HONKING HONK
18/06/2018, 20:51 - Rob;: JUSTICE FOR BENTALEB
18/06/2018, 20:51 - Phill: JUSTICE FOR HARAMBE
18/06/2018, 20:53 - Sam;: Fuck Tunisia fuck the ref and fuck Teresa may
18/06/2018, 20:53 - Sam;: Shove that up your time wasting
18/06/2018, 20:53 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
18/06/2018, 20:55 - Rob;: That was meant to be the punt chant
18/06/2018, 20:55 - Paul Dickinson: Golden boot Kane
18/06/2018, 20:56 - Paul Dickinson: Fuck Wayne Rooney as well. Kane has more World Cup goals
18/06/2018, 21:01 - Damian Rumble: I can't deal with this. What is football
18/06/2018, 21:02 - Sam;: Knew Dickinson would shoe horn in a dig at Wayne
18/06/2018, 21:16 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
18/06/2018, 21:16 - Phill: Sambo, thoughts on the new love island whatties?
18/06/2018, 21:17 - Sam;: Decent. Very cheeky. Still don‚Äôt think Alex can bag one.
18/06/2018, 21:17 - Phill: But she needs the Penis-cillin
18/06/2018, 21:22 - Sam;: But can he administer the dose.
18/06/2018, 21:25 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/06/2018, 21:25 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/06/2018, 15:51 - Paul Dickinson: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-stoke-staffordshire-44532905
19/06/2018, 15:52 - Paul Dickinson: Are people in stoke on Trent just grotty or no one can afford anything in the uk anymore?
19/06/2018, 17:23 - David;: I think we could very easily lose to Senegal
19/06/2018, 17:25 - Phill: Sam Becca's fuming about the sick because you left some on the cabinet. ü§¢üßÄ
19/06/2018, 17:25 - Rob;: Lol
19/06/2018, 17:25 - Phill: Just got back into civilisation and received a text from her at 9am saying "tell Sam he's a cunt"
19/06/2018, 17:25 - Paul Dickinson: A little gift left behind
19/06/2018, 17:25 - Damian Rumble: Is that from New year's?
19/06/2018, 17:26 - Phill: Nah he came over recently and vommed
19/06/2018, 17:26 - Phill: A grotty little chunder
19/06/2018, 17:26 - Damian Rumble: Can't take him anywhere...
19/06/2018, 17:26 - Sam;: Becca and I were texting today. It‚Äôs all smoothed over
19/06/2018, 17:27 - Phill: Well at least it's not all vomited over that's fine
19/06/2018, 17:27 - David;: How did it get concealed in the cabinet?
19/06/2018, 17:27 - Paul Dickinson: Did you leave it in a bowl in the cabinet
19/06/2018, 17:28 - Paul Dickinson: With some garnish on it
19/06/2018, 17:28 - David;: ...after also covering the tripod, files, bed. Such range
19/06/2018, 17:28 - Phill: Not sure, I think the splatter was probably quite large
19/06/2018, 17:28 - David;: Like a cluster bomb
19/06/2018, 17:28 - Phill: Sepp Splatter
19/06/2018, 17:29 - David;: Vomdurschtechnik
19/06/2018, 17:32 - Phill: Lol Damo, hang on, was he sick on New year's? Didn't even know...
19/06/2018, 17:33 - David;: Is that a 100% hit rate? A vom per game ratio of 1.
19/06/2018, 18:43 - Phill: Thus Salah mini doc
19/06/2018, 18:43 - Phill: My dick!
19/06/2018, 18:58 - Paul Dickinson: Salad going to be playing?
19/06/2018, 19:02 - Rob;: He is
19/06/2018, 19:06 - David;: How much steroids have the russians had pumped into their eyeballs? Must be considerable
19/06/2018, 19:10 - Rob;: I'd wondered if their tumble down the rankings might have been down to less doping following the investigation into the Olympics
19/06/2018, 19:18 - David;: Hamish this game had corners all over it
19/06/2018, 19:38 - Rob;: Watching great players in mediocre international teams isn't overly fun
19/06/2018, 19:39 - Rob;: Almost curse of the commentator there
19/06/2018, 19:40 - David;: Hmm quite enjoying this. The home atmosphere - feels like in the 2nd round of games there is more at stake and intensity will be higher
19/06/2018, 19:40 - David;: Also obvious team to support here
19/06/2018, 19:40 - Rob;: I just mean the disappointment of not getting to see them at their best
19/06/2018, 19:41 - Rob;: The game is interesting
19/06/2018, 19:41 - David;: Probably also because he is not fully fit
19/06/2018, 19:41 - Rob;: Cue the great chance obviously
19/06/2018, 20:20 - Phill: Russia have definitely installed magnets under the pitch or some shit
19/06/2018, 20:20 - Rob;: Paddy Power are giving 10k to LGBT causes for every Russian goal scored, so there's that at least
19/06/2018, 20:20 - Rob;: The charity troll
19/06/2018, 20:25 - David;: It will just be all the drugs surely?
19/06/2018, 20:25 - Phill: And the magnets...
19/06/2018, 20:26 - David;: All the steroids and magnets an oil field can buy
19/06/2018, 20:26 - David;: Is this egypt definitely out?
19/06/2018, 20:26 - David;: SAD
19/06/2018, 20:27 - Rob;: Not quite technically
19/06/2018, 20:28 - David;: Oh yeah they wpuld rely on saudi beating uruguay
19/06/2018, 20:28 - David;: Ah
19/06/2018, 20:28 - Paul Dickinson: Odds on Russia winning the World Cup? Have people incorporated meddling and match fixing into the odds?
19/06/2018, 20:29 - Rob;: Decent VAR for once
19/06/2018, 20:29 - David;: Nah putin will just orchestrate the maximum plausible performance i reckon. Heroic loss in semis
19/06/2018, 20:30 - David;: So it doesnt look fixed. Maybe even then put them on the wrong end of a var decision so he can claim they were robbed.
19/06/2018, 20:30 - David;: 'Nothing is true and everything is possible'
19/06/2018, 20:34 - Rob;: Huge pen?
19/06/2018, 20:35 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
19/06/2018, 20:36 - Phill: Just need to the earth's axis to switch in the next 2 mins then Egypt can win
19/06/2018, 21:36 - Sam;: BREAKING: Wilshire arsenal departure confirmed
19/06/2018, 21:37 - Phill: Pls not Liverpool pls not Liverpool
19/06/2018, 21:37 - David;: To be snuffled up on a bosman as well.
19/06/2018, 21:38 - David;: Arsenal do a good line in letting contracts run down
19/06/2018, 21:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/06/2018, 21:41 - Rob;: So in his statement he said he'd agreed the deal we'd offered, but met with Emery who told him he wouldn't play. Pretty bold move
19/06/2018, 21:42 - Phill: Emery is going to be shit
19/06/2018, 21:42 - Phill: Sounds like a massive cunt
19/06/2018, 21:42 - David;: A cunt might be who they need
19/06/2018, 21:43 - Rob;: Wenger hasn't been enough of a cunt for a decade
19/06/2018, 21:43 - Rob;: I've always said that
19/06/2018, 21:43 - David;: However, the transition from not cunt to cunt might be grating for players used to a cunt-free environment.
19/06/2018, 21:44 - Phill: Yeah imagine your boss at work left, and was replaced by an absolute cunt
19/06/2018, 21:44 - Phill: Notice. In.
19/06/2018, 21:44 - David;: What if you wanted to start winning industry awards again?
19/06/2018, 21:45 - David;: The hydrology championship
19/06/2018, 21:45 - Phill: Go to a company that wins the awards but isn't run by a cunt?
19/06/2018, 21:47 - Rob;: It would probably more cuntish to say he would play and then not play him
19/06/2018, 21:47 - David;: Yeah, to be honest seems like he hasn't been a cunt just honest
19/06/2018, 21:47 - Phill: Yeah it's brutal, but I don't think it's going to work very well until he's turned over the squad
19/06/2018, 21:47 - David;: But it's sort of fucked you in terms of losing him on a free
19/06/2018, 21:48 - Phill: So many sensitive players at arsenal. You can tell.
19/06/2018, 21:48 - David;: I mean it's Wilshere's choice to fuck off rather than fight for the place.
19/06/2018, 21:48 - David;: Also, know's he's in a strong position with wage demands now because no transfer fee.
19/06/2018, 21:48 - Rob;: And he'd basically already done that that year he went to Bournemouth
19/06/2018, 21:49 - David;: Don't actually know his level - your evertons, your southamptons?
19/06/2018, 21:50 - David;: If he wants to play. Obviously he could rot in the chelsea of city teams but then he would look ridiculous having left to play
19/06/2018, 21:50 - Rob;: I don't think he'll go to a big team
19/06/2018, 21:51 - Rob;: He's a West ham fan, he could go there
19/06/2018, 21:51 - Paul Dickinson: Fragile arsenal mentality
19/06/2018, 21:51 - David;: Pillow FC
19/06/2018, 21:51 - Paul Dickinson: Dough United
19/06/2018, 21:51 - David;: Horlicks and Warm Milk Athletic
19/06/2018, 21:56 - Phill: Tonight's Love Island
19/06/2018, 21:56 - Phill: New blonde one
19/06/2018, 21:56 - Phill: <Media omitted>
19/06/2018, 21:59 - David;: Adam
19/06/2018, 21:59 - David;: Whatty hunting.
19/06/2018, 22:04 - Phill: >Adam
19/06/2018, 22:04 - Phill: But also
19/06/2018, 22:04 - Phill: >not being Adam
19/06/2018, 22:04 - Phill: An enigma
19/06/2018, 22:05 - David;: wrapped inside a riddle, wrapped inside a cunt
19/06/2018, 22:05 - Phill: Yeah he's a massive cunt. But so much of a cunt that he doesn't care. And afterall, if you don't care, what's the problem?
19/06/2018, 22:06 - David;: Not being Adam > Being Adam > Not being Adam
19/06/2018, 22:07 - Phill: Adam. Need to think about the philosophy of Adam later.
19/06/2018, 22:07 - Phill: What is Adam?
19/06/2018, 22:07 - Phill: To Adam or not to Adam. That is the question.
19/06/2018, 22:07 - David;: Are we destined to repay the sins of Adam?
20/06/2018, 13:08 - Rob;: All the co2 is in the wrong place
20/06/2018, 13:08 - Rob;: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

Beer could fall flat for World Cup as CO2 runs short - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-44545010
20/06/2018, 13:08 - Rob;: If we could just get it out of the atmosphere and into our beer
20/06/2018, 13:11 - Stefan;: Isn't that what carbon capture & storage is for - cheap fizzy lager?
20/06/2018, 13:17 - / James Ball: Guinness will be alright as that uses nitrogen. Coke would also have issues
20/06/2018, 13:21 - Rob;: I love that due to unrelated issues the UK currently has 4 CO2 production factories that aren't functioning, out of about 7
20/06/2018, 13:21 - David;: Niche knowledge there
20/06/2018, 13:22 - David;: >not knowing the gas used in soft drinks on the uk market
20/06/2018, 14:09 - Paul Dickinson: Um hello David. Have you heard of a little player by the name of Cristiano Ronaldo? How golden are his boots looking?
20/06/2018, 14:13 - David;: Nah. Reuss is the man to watch
20/06/2018, 14:13 - David;: Egg fried Reus
20/06/2018, 14:14 - Damian Rumble: How many goals has Reus scored so far?
20/06/2018, 14:15 - David;: He's biding his time. The really great players grow into the tournament
20/06/2018, 14:16 - Paul Dickinson: He‚Äôs waiting for the quarters and semis to really show off?
20/06/2018, 14:17 - David;: Yeah no point doing it against the minnows, not a challenge for him
20/06/2018, 14:22 - David;: I mean can Ronaldo do it on a wet night in Stalingrad?
20/06/2018, 14:35 - David;: Is the group stage goal difference or head to head?
20/06/2018, 14:41 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
20/06/2018, 14:43 - David;: I mean ronaldo is a huge cunt
20/06/2018, 14:44 - David;: I would love if he VARed himself into a booking
20/06/2018, 14:59 - Sam;: World Cup is goal difference, the euros are done on head to head
20/06/2018, 15:40 - Paul Dickinson: Predictions on Uruguay v Saudi?
20/06/2018, 15:42 - Damian Rumble: Biting
20/06/2018, 15:46 - Sam;: 4-0 Uruguay
20/06/2018, 15:51 - Paul Dickinson: I reckon a goal within the first 5mins for Saudi
20/06/2018, 15:59 - Sam;: Nah, Suarez to clear off the line by biting the ball and popping it. Then shaking the flat ball around in his mouth like a fucking dog
20/06/2018, 16:00 - David;: If you did get a good bite grip on a ball could you just run up the other end and spit it into the net?
20/06/2018, 16:01 - David;: I mean teeth are part of the head. It's just like a very good header
20/06/2018, 16:01 - Rob;: I think as long as it hasn't popped that wouldn't be illegal
20/06/2018, 16:02 - Paul Dickinson: Or just inhale deeply and suck it onto the snout and carry it
20/06/2018, 16:05 - Damian Rumble: But does that mean other players are allowed to also 'head' the ball whilst in transit?
20/06/2018, 16:29 - David;: Yeah but you can just duck and weave like a growling hound so they won't get close
20/06/2018, 16:54 - Rob;: And it would be dangerous play for the opponents to raise their feet that high. It's foolproof.
20/06/2018, 17:06 - Paul Dickinson: players should shit themselves during a game
20/06/2018, 17:06 - Paul Dickinson: Tactic
20/06/2018, 17:07 - David;: Lineker already did that
20/06/2018, 17:07 - David;: Way ahead of his time
20/06/2018, 17:08 - Paul Dickinson: No one wants to get near old shit pants
20/06/2018, 17:08 - Paul Dickinson: Free run through to goal
20/06/2018, 17:10 - Rob;: Shat himself for his country
20/06/2018, 17:33 - Paul Dickinson: Snarling crawling around covered in excrement
20/06/2018, 17:33 - Paul Dickinson: Ball firmly held via the perennium
20/06/2018, 17:34 - Paul Dickinson: 100% pass rate and 3 assists per game
20/06/2018, 19:07 - Sam;: Unlikely but if Iran get a little result here Spain could be in trouble
20/06/2018, 19:08 - David;: Ronaldo broke them
20/06/2018, 19:12 - David;: Got 8-1 on a 0-0 draw
20/06/2018, 19:12 - Paul Dickinson: Can Spain not do football anymore?
20/06/2018, 19:13 - David;: They still appear to have footballers
20/06/2018, 19:13 - David;: I mean, madrid did just win the CL
20/06/2018, 19:14 - David;: The iranians do a good drone atmosphere. Like playing in a swarm of hornets
20/06/2018, 19:15 - David;: Did you see alan sugars grotty little tweet about senegal?
20/06/2018, 19:16 - Stefan;: Yeah followed by his little hissy fit when people pointed out how grotty it was
20/06/2018, 19:30 - Sam;: And he‚Äôll have learnt nothing from it, just reaffirm ed his belief that PC has gone mad. You can‚Äôt anything these days.
20/06/2018, 19:30 - Sam;: *say
20/06/2018, 19:31 - Rob;: Love that he was like 'sorry you didn't get my great joke'
20/06/2018, 19:31 - David;: Fine go imply a national football team are flogging trinkets on a beach
20/06/2018, 19:32 - David;: Coming from sugar as well. Didnt he start out flogging things from a van?
20/06/2018, 19:33 - David;: I can already cash out for profit on my 0-0.
20/06/2018, 19:34 - Sam;: Lol. Decent profit or like 5%?
20/06/2018, 19:34 - David;: Currently 4p
20/06/2018, 19:34 - David;: It just goes up from here though
20/06/2018, 19:35 - David;: Big fan of the iranian defence
20/06/2018, 19:35 - Sam;: I reckon they‚Äôll tempt you at half time.
20/06/2018, 19:36 - David;: 12p now
20/06/2018, 19:48 - Paul Dickinson: 12 pence profit?
20/06/2018, 19:48 - David;: Up to a heady 50p now
20/06/2018, 19:49 - Hamish Sinclair: How much did you put on?
20/06/2018, 19:49 - David;: That's just mine if i want it
20/06/2018, 19:49 - David;: Just the ¬£1. So ¬£8 is the max i'm looking at here. High octane betting
20/06/2018, 19:49 - Sam;: I‚Äôm really noticing the drone-sphere now. Oppressive, always making it feel like it‚Äôs the 90th minute
20/06/2018, 19:50 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah yeah yeah
20/06/2018, 19:50 - Paul Dickinson: The drone sphere?
20/06/2018, 19:50 - Phill: IRAN GOAT
20/06/2018, 19:50 - David;: Drone warfare
20/06/2018, 19:50 - David;: Spanish cant deal with it. Saw this right from the start
20/06/2018, 19:51 - Paul Dickinson: Hence why you put so much money on it
20/06/2018, 19:51 - Phill: Dave you should stick a little bet on Adam to win Love Island
20/06/2018, 19:51 - Phill: More than 10 whatties
20/06/2018, 19:53 - Sam;: Ice cold Pepsi max is GOAT
20/06/2018, 19:54 - Phill: Love how wound up Roy Keane is
20/06/2018, 19:56 - Phill: Lol these allegations are savage
20/06/2018, 19:56 - Phill: "they're cheating"
20/06/2018, 19:56 - Phill: "I didn't expect any more to be honest"
20/06/2018, 19:56 - Phill: "I hope Spain beat them now because it's so annoying"
20/06/2018, 19:57 - Paul Dickinson: He‚Äôs saying Iran are cheating?
20/06/2018, 19:58 - David;: Just the drone defence. Nothing illegal about that
20/06/2018, 19:58 - Sam;: They‚Äôre fucking jokers on itv. Wrighty asking, what‚Äôs he doing in the woods? About Southgate falling over on a run
20/06/2018, 19:59 - David;: Implying cottaging?
20/06/2018, 19:59 - Paul Dickinson: What is this drone defense?!
20/06/2018, 19:59 - Sam;: The noise Paul
20/06/2018, 19:59 - Sam;: Like the vuvuzela
20/06/2018, 19:59 - David;: Drone + defence = drone defence
20/06/2018, 19:59 - Paul Dickinson: The sound of a drone
20/06/2018, 20:00 - Paul Dickinson: Not actual drones
20/06/2018, 20:00 - Sam;: üòÇ
20/06/2018, 20:00 - Sam;: Nah mate
20/06/2018, 20:00 - David;: Are you watching? The drone is overwhelming
20/06/2018, 20:00 - Paul Dickinson: No, I‚Äôm at work
20/06/2018, 20:00 - Paul Dickinson: So they‚Äôre human vuvuzelas
20/06/2018, 20:00 - David;: Well there is drone.
20/06/2018, 20:00 - Paul Dickinson: Like a hum
20/06/2018, 20:01 - Sam;: Yeah
20/06/2018, 20:01 - Paul Dickinson: Hum defence
20/06/2018, 20:01 - David;: Yeah, constantly in the background from the Iran fans.
20/06/2018, 20:01 - Sam;: But not a cheerful little jack hum
20/06/2018, 20:01 - David;: Like a swarm of hornets in a nearby glade
20/06/2018, 20:01 - Sam;: A fucking honk in your ear for 90 mins
20/06/2018, 20:01 - David;: Threatening
20/06/2018, 20:03 - Paul Dickinson: And this is cheating?
20/06/2018, 20:03 - Sam;: No no
20/06/2018, 20:04 - Sam;: The cheating is referring to the gamesmanship on the pitch
20/06/2018, 20:04 - Paul Dickinson: And what are they doing?
20/06/2018, 20:05 - Paul Dickinson: I thought it was just a game of footeh
20/06/2018, 20:05 - Sam;: Classic stuff. Feigning injury, wasting time, gabbing the refs bollocks
20/06/2018, 20:05 - David;: Backed up by drone
20/06/2018, 20:06 - David;: The two form a complementary strategy
20/06/2018, 20:06 - David;: The drone defence if you will
20/06/2018, 20:06 - Paul Dickinson: Grabbing the refs bollocks
20/06/2018, 20:07 - Paul Dickinson: Like the time sian Massey got rogered mid game
20/06/2018, 20:07 - Sam;: Lel. Need an image, was it vermaelen?
20/06/2018, 20:08 - Sam;: https://goo.gl/images/5YshzQ
20/06/2018, 20:09 - Sam;: >a fumble
20/06/2018, 20:09 - Paul Dickinson: Stuck it right in. Not a second thought
20/06/2018, 20:09 - David;: I mean what did she expect?
20/06/2018, 20:10 - Paul Dickinson: Caught a bit of the game in the lunch room. Heard the humming
20/06/2018, 20:11 - David;: That'll be the drone there raaab
20/06/2018, 20:11 - Paul Dickinson: Sorry the drone
20/06/2018, 20:12 - Sam;: Fuck
20/06/2018, 20:12 - David;: Shit the bed
20/06/2018, 20:12 - Sam;: Iran nearly scoring
20/06/2018, 20:12 - David;: That fucks my ¬£8 too of course
20/06/2018, 20:12 - Jack G;: Better cash out
20/06/2018, 20:13 - Sam;: Fucked it dave
20/06/2018, 20:13 - David;: Ah. Weeel
20/06/2018, 20:13 - David;: I also have a quid on spain winning + iniesta scoring at 5-1 so if iniesta scores i'm fine
20/06/2018, 20:14 - David;: Easy
20/06/2018, 20:14 - Jack G;: So many own goals this World Cup
20/06/2018, 20:16 - Sam;: Now that Iran are trying they actually have a half decent attack..
20/06/2018, 20:16 - David;: Can they turn drone into attack?
20/06/2018, 20:16 - David;: Spain are the international version of Arsenal
20/06/2018, 20:21 - David;: Hooooonk
20/06/2018, 20:21 - Sam;: VAR to call it...
20/06/2018, 20:21 - David;: They have celebrated so hard if this is dissallowed
20/06/2018, 20:22 - David;: The guy was kissing the turf
20/06/2018, 20:22 - David;: Thanking allah
20/06/2018, 20:23 - David;: Shit storm
20/06/2018, 20:23 - Sam;: It was offside on review, pretty obvious
20/06/2018, 20:23 - Paul Dickinson: Fuck VAR
20/06/2018, 20:24 - Sam;: Iran come out to play - hoddle
20/06/2018, 20:24 - Sam;: When the bats come out Iran come out to play
20/06/2018, 20:25 - David;: Lol
20/06/2018, 20:26 - David;: They still have the drone on their side. That's a major asset
20/06/2018, 20:26 - Paul Dickinson: Not hearing much drone
20/06/2018, 20:26 - Sam;: It‚Äôs flagging a bit
20/06/2018, 20:26 - Sam;: Need an equaliser to bring the energy back
20/06/2018, 20:27 - Paul Dickinson: Grab the refs bollocks
20/06/2018, 20:27 - David;: Unrestricted drone warfare
20/06/2018, 20:28 - David;: Chaos
20/06/2018, 20:29 - Sam;: That melee
20/06/2018, 20:29 - David;: Bundle!
20/06/2018, 20:29 - Sam;: Costa just hacking bodies
20/06/2018, 20:31 - David;: I'm still gwtting froust withdrawal from the weekend. Upset i can't watch every match
20/06/2018, 20:31 - Sam;: At least you got the only day with four consecutive games
20/06/2018, 20:32 - David;: Yeah, which we extended with 2 more 90 minute reruns
20/06/2018, 20:33 - David;: Ah. Iniesta went off. So bets fucked
20/06/2018, 20:33 - David;: Mugs game.
20/06/2018, 20:33 - Paul Dickinson: When‚Äôs the next froust scheduled?
20/06/2018, 20:33 - David;: Wales
20/06/2018, 20:34 - Paul Dickinson: Rotting about developing duck butter in the eye of the froust
20/06/2018, 20:38 - Paul Dickinson: Just 20 days to go
20/06/2018, 20:39 - David;: Yeah. Have a job interview and presentation to prepare and give the week before
20/06/2018, 20:39 - Paul Dickinson: What‚Äôs the job?
20/06/2018, 20:39 - David;: Plus chapter to submit. Will need to bloot after that.
20/06/2018, 20:39 - David;: Teaching fellow in political economy
20/06/2018, 20:39 - David;: At warwick still
20/06/2018, 20:41 - Paul Dickinson: Bbc needs to stop reporting on memes as news
20/06/2018, 20:41 - Paul Dickinson: The bbc is shit now
20/06/2018, 20:41 - Sam;: Fuuuk. Iran should have scored
20/06/2018, 20:42 - David;: That was the moment
20/06/2018, 20:46 - David;: Prem teams should hoover up the iranian defenders
20/06/2018, 20:46 - Phill: Or get rid of their Spanish players
20/06/2018, 20:47 - Jack G;: Or get their fans to employ the drone defence
20/06/2018, 20:48 - David;: Ever banega to arsenal?
20/06/2018, 20:48 - David;: Ah yeah maybe its more the drone tactic they need to replicate
20/06/2018, 20:48 - Phill: Nah, never have..
20/06/2018, 20:57 - Paul Dickinson: Boring Spain
20/06/2018, 20:57 - Paul Dickinson: The prawn spainwich brigade
21/06/2018, 07:36 - Rob;: Just read that...
21/06/2018, 07:36 - Rob;: Spain are above Portugal in Group B because of Adrien Silva's injury-time yellow card earlier. It comes down to fair play because their goal difference and head to head are identical
21/06/2018, 10:05 - Sam;: Yeah, there‚Äôs a big list they go through to find a separator
21/06/2018, 10:56 - Rob;: I do hope bassoon is on that list
21/06/2018, 10:56 - Rob;: Corners?
21/06/2018, 10:57 - David;: Could it be the case that 2 teams were playing only to get each other booked?
21/06/2018, 10:57 - David;: Actually no because the head to head would always be at stake.
21/06/2018, 10:58 - David;: Would be good though.
21/06/2018, 10:58 - David;: Cards become goals
21/06/2018, 10:58 - David;: Celebrated wildly
21/06/2018, 11:40 - Sam;: Bernd Leno is a big signing in my grotty little book
21/06/2018, 11:45 - Rob;: I am intentionally withholding judgement and have not watched any videos, but I like that we're identifying a keeper about to come into his prime. We've sacked our old goalkeeper coach, which was probably long overdue considering that he seemed to introduce the same deficiencies into young keepers
21/06/2018, 11:46 - Rob;: The reaction hasn't been 100% positive, but then fans tend to prefer big names to taking chances
21/06/2018, 11:48 - David;: Looks decent
21/06/2018, 11:49 - David;: Lucas Torreira next apparently
21/06/2018, 11:49 - Rob;: Yes I like the look of him too
21/06/2018, 11:49 - Jack G;: Also, it‚Äôs good that you have someone to replace Per as a BFG now that he‚Äôs retired
21/06/2018, 11:51 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/06/2018, 11:51 - David;: I mean, what a massive bell end.
21/06/2018, 11:52 - David;: It's fucking all about him. I refuse to care, fuck off Emre.
21/06/2018, 11:52 - Sam;: Rubbing your nose it.
21/06/2018, 11:53 - Sam;: He‚Äôs been more than replaced though with fabo and keito
21/06/2018, 11:53 - David;: Fabo, Keito, Hendo. Decent
21/06/2018, 11:53 - David;: with Oxo
21/06/2018, 11:53 - David;: Milno
21/06/2018, 11:53 - Sam;: Robust
21/06/2018, 11:54 - David;: I think lallana might be broken though
21/06/2018, 11:54 - Sam;: Emre can you piss off?

Yeah, banana‚Äôs split
21/06/2018, 11:54 - David;: Probably need one more more creative midfielder if the Ox is out, now Coutinho is gone
21/06/2018, 12:04 - Rob;: With this I think it means Xhaka will be made into a passer rather than a defensive mid, which will play to his strengths and compensate for his lack of concentration.
21/06/2018, 12:08 - David;: Is Torreira just a blocking man?
21/06/2018, 12:08 - Rob;: Ever Benega looks like it might happen. I hope as a Cazorla replacement, rather than a replacement for anyone else
21/06/2018, 12:08 - David;: But wilshere gone as well
21/06/2018, 12:08 - Rob;: A mascherano type I think
21/06/2018, 12:09 - David;: Yeah, aka blocking man 1.0
21/06/2018, 12:09 - David;: You need that
21/06/2018, 12:10 - Rob;: Torreira replacing old Xhaka, new xhaka replacing Wilshere, Banega replacing Cazorla. Maitland Niles and Eleneny as cover
21/06/2018, 12:12 - David;: So first choice would be torreira, xhaka, banega after all this?
21/06/2018, 12:12 - Jack G;: What about Ramsey?
21/06/2018, 12:12 - Rob;: Yeah Ramsey first choice
21/06/2018, 12:13 - David;: Oh, behind banega?
21/06/2018, 12:13 - Rob;: I think Banega would be a squad player
21/06/2018, 12:13 - David;: So Never Banega?
21/06/2018, 12:13 - Rob;: Sometimes Banega
21/06/2018, 12:14 - Jack G;: Banega in Europa
21/06/2018, 12:14 - Rob;: I hope ozil is moved wide. You can do proper pressing with Ramsey at number 10
21/06/2018, 12:15 - David;: Ever Banega in England? No, i've only Banega in Europe
21/06/2018, 12:16 - David;: How does Lacazette play with Aubameyang?
21/06/2018, 12:17 - Rob;: They did play pretty well with each other at the end of last season. Lacazette starting wide and popping up in the middle whenever Aubemeyang dropped off
21/06/2018, 12:17 - Rob;: I would start like that, with ozil in the other wide spot, and Ramsey, Torreira and Xhaka behind
21/06/2018, 12:27 - David;: Hmm i'd be worried about lack of width if that is the starting team
21/06/2018, 12:28 - David;: Especially if 4 at back still so no wing backs
21/06/2018, 12:30 - Jack G;: Bring back the 4-1-2-1-2 worked for AC Milan back in the day. Very diamond
21/06/2018, 12:30 - Rob;: We don't currently have a natural wide player, it's all number 9s or 10s Hopefully that will be rectified
21/06/2018, 12:32 - David;: Rogers played that year we came 2nd with coutinho at front of diamond behind suarez/sturridge.
21/06/2018, 12:36 - David;: There's a very Mads Mikkelsen vibe to Emery
21/06/2018, 12:45 - Rob;: I can't wait for 442 and strike partnerships again
21/06/2018, 12:46 - David;: Arguably a good solution to the high press? Play over the press with quick and strong forwards latching onto the balls to exploit the space
21/06/2018, 12:50 - Rob;: I think you need two absolute worldwide in the centre of midfield for it against the top sides
21/06/2018, 12:51 - Rob;: *worldies
21/06/2018, 12:55 - David;: Thing is, with 2nd striker and wingers pushed forward it basically ends up as 4-2-3-1
21/06/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: Yeah, those two systems are very similar
21/06/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: But what I like about 442 is the partnerships. Partnerships all over the pitch
21/06/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: Mostly this is nostalgia
21/06/2018, 13:37 - Paul Dickinson: 5 corners in aus v Denmark so far
21/06/2018, 13:39 - David;: What would happen to have a heaviky unbalanced formation with both wingers on one side ofthe pitch. Just aim to outnumber them on one side and always play the ball out to that side. Or when you get the ball everyone runs over to one side of the pitch suddenly?
21/06/2018, 13:41 - David;: Or keep cycling through formations, changing to a new one every 5 minutes in a pre-defined pattern? Other team wouldnt know how to deal with it.
21/06/2018, 14:04 - Paul Dickinson: Is this so mental it will work?
21/06/2018, 14:07 - David;: Or surround the person on the ball with a huddle of people so can't be tackled, and then just slowly walk up the pitch in a phallanx?
21/06/2018, 14:09 - Paul Dickinson: Nonsense. Snarling shitting hound crawling the ball is a much better tactic
21/06/2018, 15:56 - Paul Dickinson: I hear they have redone the Chequers? Have they fucked it?
21/06/2018, 15:56 - Paul Dickinson: There‚Äôs nothing traditional left
21/06/2018, 16:10 - Damian Rumble: I'm going there on Friday to check it out
21/06/2018, 16:14 - Damian Rumble: A victory for Peru would make this group very spicy...
21/06/2018, 16:15 - Paul Dickinson: Report back with pictures
21/06/2018, 16:17 - Rob;: But the dank
21/06/2018, 16:17 - Rob;: The dank
21/06/2018, 16:24 - Paul Dickinson: Group F could also get interesting when they play again
21/06/2018, 17:37 - David;: Lol. Burger king

21/06/2018, 18:54 - Phill: 3-2 Argentina Messi hattrick

21/06/2018, 18:56 - Sam;: Biggest game since Spain porty yeah. I‚Äôd lov it if Croatia beat them. Lov it
21/06/2018, 18:57 - Sam;: Have you seen that Adam has been used as an example of emotional abuse by women‚Äôs aid? The size of the world of pain he‚Äôs in for when he returns.
21/06/2018, 18:57 - Paul Dickinson: Argie bargie arsehole
21/06/2018, 18:59 - Sam;: Not only do the VAR team wear a kit, they change the fucking colour. Red tonight..
21/06/2018, 19:01 - Paul Dickinson: The var team

21/06/2018, 19:08 - David;: Right so i need over 3 goals, over 3 card and over 10 corners. Then i'm ¬£60 to the good.
21/06/2018, 19:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah the corner trap
21/06/2018, 19:08 - David;: Yeah i'm riding the corner rush
21/06/2018, 19:08 - Hamish Sinclair: 1 do fat
21/06/2018, 19:08 - David;: Back on the corner wagon
21/06/2018, 19:09 - Hamish Sinclair: Messi to have 4 +shots on target is 7/1
21/06/2018, 19:09 - Hamish Sinclair: Can see him just trying to bloot them from 70mins onwards
21/06/2018, 19:09 - Phill: 1 do fat

21/06/2018, 19:17 - David;: Looking spicy. Confident about meeting my card quota
21/06/2018, 19:21 - David;: The argentina defence. How are they so bad? Suddenly otamendi looks a liability
21/06/2018, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Is it 3 yellows?
21/06/2018, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Does a straight red count as 2?
21/06/2018, 19:22 - David;: Just 3 cards it said
21/06/2018, 19:22 - David;: Think red would be 1 towards that?
21/06/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Mercado for Argentina is that really cunty right back that plays for sevilla
21/06/2018, 19:28 - Paul Dickinson: Muscat
21/06/2018, 19:29 - David;: How the fuck has he missed that
21/06/2018, 19:37 - David;: How fucked are argentina if they don't win this?
21/06/2018, 19:45 - David;: Not a corner heavy game so far

21/06/2018, 20:12 - Sam;: Mental
21/06/2018, 20:13 - David;: Needing a goal. Take off only goalscorer of tournament
21/06/2018, 20:13 - Sam;: Beckham predicted an Argentina England final..
21/06/2018, 20:14 - David;: It brings to mind Raul Meireles' volley for liverpool in the 2012-13 season.
21/06/2018, 20:15 - David;: Here we go. Another card there as well
21/06/2018, 20:16 - Hamish Sinclair: How many corners do you still need?

21/06/2018, 21:13 - David;: Divides opinion.
21/06/2018, 21:15 - Sam;: But the game is to be the last couple standing. Everyone hates him and all new girls will know he‚Äôs a prick

22/06/2018, 13:23 - David;: But doubt is a key part of faith
22/06/2018, 13:24 - David;: Did they watch any of the football this season? Are they aware of firmino?
22/06/2018, 14:05 - Jack G;: I think it‚Äôs because Neymar and Jesus are best mates
22/06/2018, 14:13 - David;: But firmino is mates with coutinho
22/06/2018, 14:36 - Sam;: Big bollocks from the ref there
22/06/2018, 14:36 - David;: VAR!
22/06/2018, 14:36 - Sam;: Right decision
22/06/2018, 14:36 - David;: Should book him
22/06/2018, 14:36 - Sam;: Hate to see a pen for such slight contact
22/06/2018, 14:36 - David;: Yeah great decision
22/06/2018, 14:37 - Sam;: It‚Äôs like you can‚Äôt force a decision from the ref now because he can just review it
22/06/2018, 14:37 - David;: Love it. The bell ends have lost
22/06/2018, 14:38 - David;: Loving this. Cards now as well.
22/06/2018, 14:38 - Sam;: Brazil will dive everywhere now

22/06/2018, 17:07 - Sam;: You Musa be a having a laugh
22/06/2018, 17:11 - Rob;: Goalgeria
22/06/2018, 17:11 - Rob;: Letting Agentina off the hook
22/06/2018, 17:27 - Jack G;: Argentina are a shambles though. Could they handle Musa?
22/06/2018, 17:34 - Sam;: The moose
22/06/2018, 17:34 - David;: The mad moose
22/06/2018, 17:36 - David;: Have lileicester sold him then?
22/06/2018, 17:36 - Rob;: If Nigeria win here and beat Argentina, Argentina could finish bottom
22/06/2018, 17:37 - David;: But if argentina beat nigeria is it back in their hands now?
22/06/2018, 17:37 - Rob;: Yeah
22/06/2018, 17:38 - Rob;: No, wait, bother them and Iceland could get 4 points, so no
22/06/2018, 17:38 - Rob;: Going to be a huge last day in that group
22/06/2018, 17:40 - David;: So it would GD because they have same head to head
22/06/2018, 17:40 - David;: So still in their hands in that they can improve their own goal difference
22/06/2018, 17:40 - Rob;: Yeah
22/06/2018, 17:41 - Rob;: But if Iceland don't lose by 3 they will start 1 better off
22/06/2018, 17:41 - Rob;: It could feasibly go down to cards
22/06/2018, 17:41 - David;: Yes, but facing a better team
22/06/2018, 17:42 - Rob;: Who have already qualified though
22/06/2018, 21:25 - Damian Rumble: Chequers is exactly the same. Badger and all.
22/06/2018, 22:11 - Phill: Dave, Becca wants to know who your favourite bit of whattie is on love island?
22/06/2018, 22:35 - Paul Dickinson: BREAKING: Chicago cubs owners express interest in buying AC Milan
22/06/2018, 22:35 - Phill: Red Sox own Liverpool
23/06/2018, 10:39 - Sam;: Aren‚Äôt AC owned by Chinese who‚Äôve spent loads on their debt, then on players.
23/06/2018, 10:56 - David;: The messi of the alps
23/06/2018, 10:57 - David;: But actually more goals than messi at this world cup now
23/06/2018, 11:11 - David;: ‚ÄúSeveral people afterwards told him how inappropriate and hurtful his use of the N-word was, and Jonathan apologised to those that had been in the meeting,‚Äù Mr Hastings wrote.

‚ÄúWe hoped this was an awful anomaly never to be repeated.‚Äù

However, a few days later the term was used again - this time at a meeting of black employees at the company.
23/06/2018, 11:11 - David;: ah
23/06/2018, 11:24 - Stefan;: Racially abuse me once, shame on you

23/06/2018, 12:46 - Paul Dickinson: Can I get an 8 ball of coke please
23/06/2018, 12:47 - Paul Dickinson: 3.5 grams

23/06/2018, 12:55 - Phill: I'm getting half an ounce of weed so everyone can just grab some
23/06/2018, 12:58 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôll go halves on ket with you Phil
23/06/2018, 12:58 - Phill: Alright well if we get 3 grams then we can split it 50/50 and get 1.5 each
23/06/2018, 13:00 - Phill: 3 GRAMS OF KET

23/06/2018, 13:17 - Stefan;: He doesn't do half grams
23/06/2018, 13:21 - Paul Dickinson: Doesn‚Äôt do 8 balls of coke? I‚Äôll get 3 in that case
23/06/2018, 13:21 - Paul Dickinson: 3g
23/06/2018, 13:58 - Stefan;: Ok
23/06/2018, 13:58 - Stefan;: Ket is ¬£40

23/06/2018, 15:15 - Hamish Sinclair: üëçket
23/06/2018, 16:47 - David;: 8 corners already this match. You don't see that
23/06/2018, 17:05 - Phill: I always find it surprising that Korea don't have some skillful wanderkid
23/06/2018, 17:05 - Phill: Their stereotype demands it
23/06/2018, 17:55 - David;: Ozil. Dropped
23/06/2018, 17:55 - David;: Finally
23/06/2018, 17:57 - David;: Reus starting. It begins.

23/06/2018, 18:19 - Phill: This particular one is a tempranillo
23/06/2018, 18:20 - Phill: With some aragones and castelao
23/06/2018, 18:21 - David;: Don't rate tempranillo usually, but always had it from Spain. Willing to be convinced
23/06/2018, 18:21 - Phill: Will bring some value Portuguese wine to Wales
23/06/2018, 18:22 - Phill: No I'm not usually a fan of tempranillo either
23/06/2018, 18:22 - Phill: Too full-bodied and smoky
23/06/2018, 18:22 - David;: Shall we do another order where we get a couple of cases of red between those who drink wine?
23/06/2018, 18:23 - Phill: Yeah it makes sense.
23/06/2018, 18:23 - David;: Yeah exactly. Spice and alcohol everywhere. Stay
23/06/2018, 18:23 - Phill: Because i will gump it.
23/06/2018, 18:24 - Phill: Ket. Acid. Weed. Red.

23/06/2018, 19:40 - Hamish Sinclair: I have lukaka golden booy
23/06/2018, 19:41 - Phill: Maybe even Croatia as an outside shot
23/06/2018, 19:41 - Sam;: Booooy
23/06/2018, 19:41 - Hamish Sinclair: He's banging them in
23/06/2018, 19:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Croatia look great
23/06/2018, 19:41 - Phill: Dat midfield
23/06/2018, 19:41 - Hamish Sinclair: France obviously still in with a massive shout
23/06/2018, 19:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Who can England get in the next round realistically?
23/06/2018, 19:44 - Rob;: It's the winner or runner up of Poland/Colombia/Japan/Senegal
23/06/2018, 19:44 - Sam;: It is known. Group h
23/06/2018, 19:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Shit, hope we avoid senegal

23/06/2018, 20:29 - Phill: I disagree
23/06/2018, 20:32 - Sam;: Sweden have made him look average. And his injury record is bad
23/06/2018, 20:40 - Rob;: And cards or corners bets in this?
23/06/2018, 20:40 - Sam;: Any objection now phil?
23/06/2018, 20:40 - Phill: No. I hope united sign him. Because he's shit.
23/06/2018, 20:41 - Sam;: Lel
23/06/2018, 20:42 - Sam;: Dubious process for giving the second yellow though. A long gap between foul and card
23/06/2018, 20:42 - Phill: Don't care. Fuck Germany.
23/06/2018, 20:43 - Sam;: Obvs

24/06/2018, 11:22 - David;: Also dat heat
24/06/2018, 11:22 - David;: How are we always playing in tropical conditions in fucking russia?
24/06/2018, 11:22 - Phill: Where in Russia is it?
24/06/2018, 11:23 - David;: East of moscow

24/06/2018, 11:23 - Phill: Continental weatge
24/06/2018, 11:23 - Phill: Climate even
24/06/2018, 11:24 - Phill: Hits 30+ regularly in Finland over the summer
24/06/2018, 11:25 - Phill: We just get mugged off by the whims of the jet stream here
24/06/2018, 11:49 - Sam;: Just looking at England‚Äôs tournament record in 80‚Äôs. Fucking hell. Lost all three group games in Euro 88
24/06/2018, 11:52 - Sam;: Fuck. I just looked at the 70‚Äôs. Christ
24/06/2018, 11:52 - Sam;: At least there‚Äôs a QF in the 80‚Äôs
24/06/2018, 12:14 - Rob;: So we've actually lived through one of the best periods
24/06/2018, 12:14 - Rob;: Three quarters and a semi
24/06/2018, 12:15 - Rob;: Including Euros
24/06/2018, 12:15 - Damian Rumble: When was the last time we failed to qualify for the world cup?
24/06/2018, 12:16 - Rob;: 94?

24/06/2018, 12:23 - Damian Rumble: In other news...

24/06/2018, 12:24 - Damian Rumble: We're in tier A in a pool with Spain and Croatia
24/06/2018, 12:24 - Damian Rumble: Wales, NI, RoI all in tier B
24/06/2018, 12:26 - Damian Rumble: First matches 6th September
24/06/2018, 12:28 - Sam;: I think it‚Äôll be quite good. Instantly better than friendlies
24/06/2018, 12:31 - Sam;: Nearly game time!
24/06/2018, 12:31 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
24/06/2018, 12:36 - Jack G;: Lol Cesc with the burn on Spurs
24/06/2018, 12:36 - Sam;: Yeah, has to get it in
24/06/2018, 13:07 - David;: We really were a piece of shit in the 70s and 80s. Relebtlessly losing everything
24/06/2018, 13:08 - David;: Italia 90 only time we've made it to world cup semis since 66
24/06/2018, 13:08 - David;: Honk. Stones
24/06/2018, 13:08 - Jack G;: Hooooonnnk
24/06/2018, 13:08 - Phill: Honk honk honk

24/06/2018, 13:09 - Jack G;: The Panama guy wrestling Maguire too though lol
24/06/2018, 13:09 - Hamish Sinclair: Jordan Henderson honking that incredibly hard
24/06/2018, 13:10 - David;: When was the last time a defender scored in the world cup?
24/06/2018, 13:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Upson against Germany 2010
24/06/2018, 13:10 - David;: üëç
24/06/2018, 13:16 - David;: We are essentially being outplayed here though
24/06/2018, 13:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh. We are shit in posession
24/06/2018, 13:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Ref is a prick tho.  Basically allowing them to be really physical and then blowing against every touch against them
24/06/2018, 13:17 - David;: Yeah they go down under no pressure. But we are being naive in the way we're pressing
24/06/2018, 13:18 - David;: If you even step close to a player behind them the ref will give a foul
24/06/2018, 13:19 - Jack G;: Our build up looks so slow. Is the heat making them conserve energy?
24/06/2018, 13:19 - Jack G;: Honk
24/06/2018, 13:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Really hate a team that gives it out physically and then roles around looking for yellow cards when it's done back to them
24/06/2018, 13:20 - Damian Rumble: Poor Jessie is getting totally bullied in this game.
24/06/2018, 13:22 - Jack G;: Dat pen

24/06/2018, 13:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Top corner
24/06/2018, 13:23 - Rob;: Ah, this projector steam is well behind. Pen just went in
24/06/2018, 13:24 - Rob;: I'm getting delay
24/06/2018, 13:24 - Sam;: Lol.. where are you watching? Just get on iPlayer
24/06/2018, 13:25 - David;: There must have been a horrific injury they need to stop you seeing
24/06/2018, 13:25 - David;: We've all seen it hours ago. Kane's head falls off
24/06/2018, 13:27 - David;: So if we rack up better GD than belgium here a draw is enough to top group?
24/06/2018, 13:27 - Hamish Sinclair: üëç
24/06/2018, 13:28 - David;: We'd need 3 more goals for that though
24/06/2018, 13:29 - Rob;: A friend's party, they've set it up via the BBC website I think
24/06/2018, 13:35 - David;: Fuck
24/06/2018, 13:35 - David;: Fuck
24/06/2018, 13:35 - Jack G;: Fuck me
24/06/2018, 13:35 - Sam;: What a fucking goal
24/06/2018, 13:35 - Jack G;: Blingard

24/06/2018, 13:40 - Sam;: Dat set play. Brilliant

24/06/2018, 13:45 - Jack G;: Goal difference sorted
24/06/2018, 13:45 - David;: This is insane
24/06/2018, 13:46 - David;: Still need another because they have s ored more
24/06/2018, 13:46 - Sam;: Is this real life
24/06/2018, 13:46 - Paul Dickinson: It is Panama
24/06/2018, 13:46 - Paul Dickinson: The canal
24/06/2018, 13:46 - Jack G;: Belgium vs England will be great. Doesn‚Äôt really make much difference either way so just an exhibition basically
24/06/2018, 13:47 - Phill: >not wanting to beat Belgium to maintain momentum
24/06/2018, 13:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah need to win it to avoid senegal
24/06/2018, 13:47 - Jack G;: True
24/06/2018, 13:47 - Jack G;: Senegal look slick
24/06/2018, 13:47 - Stefan;: This is liquid football

24/06/2018, 14:15 - David;: Love that even stones goal was set up by sterling missing a sitter
24/06/2018, 14:16 - Sam;: It‚Äôs time for rashford. One more goal and we‚Äôre top
24/06/2018, 14:17 - Jack G;: Yeah Lingard off for Rashford. He‚Äôs been knocked about a lot, needs a rest

24/06/2018, 14:19 - Jack G;: Golden Kane
24/06/2018, 14:20 - David;: Hat trick with his perrenium
24/06/2018, 14:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Everyone so keen to give that to kane but pretty sure it's on target
24/06/2018, 14:21 - Phill: Doesn't matter for friendly fire
24/06/2018, 14:21 - Rob;: Yeah, but one can't use his hands
24/06/2018, 14:21 - Jack G;: Kane will claim it definitely though
24/06/2018, 14:21 - Jack G;: He‚Äôd claim anything
24/06/2018, 14:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Kanes claimed lingaard aswell
24/06/2018, 14:28 - David;: Trippier off but not Trent. Mental
24/06/2018, 14:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Think they're trying to get rose match fit
24/06/2018, 14:30 - David;: Is that the shittest hat trick at a world cup? 2 pens and a perrenium deflection?
24/06/2018, 14:31 - Jack G;: Very Dirk Kuyt
24/06/2018, 14:32 - Sam;: Yeah but those pens..
24/06/2018, 14:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh I've got a lot of time for those pens
24/06/2018, 14:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Dem pens doe
24/06/2018, 14:35 - David;: Like the vibe of their manager just being like 'yeah we are shit'. Before the game he was saying he thought they would be beaten 3-0 again.
24/06/2018, 14:35 - David;: And said he thought they played really well against belgium. Nothing he woukd change
24/06/2018, 14:36 - Sam;: Fuck sake.
24/06/2018, 14:38 - Rob;: A second keeper would save that. #naiive
24/06/2018, 14:40 - Rob;: Does this mean the Eng-Bel game will come down to bookings if it's a draw
24/06/2018, 14:40 - Rob;: Goading will become a huge tactic
24/06/2018, 14:40 - Rob;: The name-calling
24/06/2018, 14:40 - Jack G;: Yeah
24/06/2018, 14:41 - David;: Yeah only cards in it
24/06/2018, 14:42 - Sam;: We‚Äôre winning 2 to three on cards right?
24/06/2018, 14:45 - Sam;: The fifa live table has us top, sky sports has us second..
24/06/2018, 14:45 - Jack G;: Vardy vs Lukaku in a street fight for top spot
24/06/2018, 14:46 - Rob;: Technically all the goals scored etc measurements come in at the end so most auto-tables just use the alphabet during the tournament
24/06/2018, 14:47 - Rob;: Baloy D'or
24/06/2018, 14:47 - Sam;: Not fifa it seems..
24/06/2018, 14:48 - Rob;: Yeah makes sense for the tournament runners to take the time to get it right
24/06/2018, 15:09 - Phill: Il just leave this here...
24/06/2018, 15:09 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/06/2018, 15:12 - David;: Weeeel. It was the expectation management we needed. Kept our feet on the ground.
24/06/2018, 15:13 - Rob;: After a decade of Phil-bet ribbing, you have to respect that
24/06/2018, 15:15 - Phill: Wander what the odds would have been
24/06/2018, 15:43 - Damian Rumble: Lol
24/06/2018, 16:39 - Sam;: 6-1 just hit me again. I‚Äôm in World Cup dreamland üòçüòç

24/06/2018, 16:39 - Rob;: Never stop me dreaming
24/06/2018, 16:39 - Rob;: Best world cup
24/06/2018, 17:12 - David;: Being doing some more google translate of world cup stories
24/06/2018, 17:12 - David;: From Le Monde: 'Following a hanging of Lingard in the surface, Kane turned the penalty and put the English away. After a marvel of striking Lingard in the skylight Panamanian, the scenario of the start of the meeting has been repeated. Successively, Stones of the head and Kane, of a shell on penalty, allowed the English to join the locker room by leading 5-0.'
24/06/2018, 17:13 - David;: Repeated attempts to Manchester
24/06/2018, 17:14 - David;: 'The scorer of the Three Lions took advantage of the second period to become the third Englishman to sign a hat-trick (not a hat-trick, damage to Panama) in the World Cup (after Hearst and Linecker), after diverting a shot from Loftus-Cheek in the cages of Panama. And to take the lead of the top scorers of the competition alone: ‚Äã‚Äãwith five goals scored in two games, "Prince Harry" joined Just Fontaine in the history of the World Cup.'
24/06/2018, 17:15 - David;: >a hat-trick (not a hat-trick)
24/06/2018, 17:18 - David;: >the scenario at the start of the meeting
24/06/2018, 17:18 - David;: Rob how could we make a blog or something that was all translated football stories?
24/06/2018, 17:19 - Rob;: We probably could
24/06/2018, 17:20 - Rob;: And I think you would stumble on some lovely phrases
24/06/2018, 17:20 - David;: It seems to produce a weird sort of poetry
24/06/2018, 17:21 - Rob;: The skylight Panamanian is like a novel title
24/06/2018, 17:21 - Rob;: Perhaps a Twitter account where we select the best phrases
24/06/2018, 17:22 - Phill: Yeah Twitter would be more reactive. You could use hashtags that are trending during the game to get exposure
24/06/2018, 17:23 - David;: It's particularly good with sports stories where there are so many idioms and weird culturally specific phrases
24/06/2018, 17:24 - Rob;: Yeah, it's idioms Taht Google can't deal with
24/06/2018, 17:24 - David;: But it has to do something with them
24/06/2018, 17:25 - Rob;: It sort of honours the otiginal creativity of idioms, returns the spark they had before they were over used
24/06/2018, 17:28 - David;: I like trying to work out what they could possibly be getting at
24/06/2018, 17:32 - Rob;: Skighlight = hope?
24/06/2018, 17:32 - David;: "The Panamanians had to bring back a positive result to hope to come out of the chicken phases. But the match started badly for the players led by Hern√°n Dar√≠o G√≥mez. In the 8th minute, on a corner right corner hit by Trippier, John Stones stood out perfectly to place a head in the small opposite net. Imparable for Penedo, the Panamanian porter. Panama, which evolved with a very dense and very low block, posed problems for the British in construction. Gareth Southgate's men chained the long balloons deep to find Sterling and Lingard."
24/06/2018, 17:32 - Rob;: Oh a heavenly strike?
24/06/2018, 17:32 - David;: 'the chicken phases'
24/06/2018, 17:32 - Rob;: The cowardly beginning?
24/06/2018, 17:33 - David;: 'chained the long balloons deep'
24/06/2018, 17:33 - Rob;: Very Blan Y Cwm
24/06/2018, 17:34 - David;: Harry Kane took the opportunity to score his third goal of the competition (22nd). Lingard was then highlighted by shaking the nets.The Manchester United player found a stint with Sterling before attempting a slightly coiled right foot shot that deceived Penedo (36 '). In the wake, on a nice free kick and a beautiful combination in three times, the head of Sterling came knocking on the Panamanian goalkeeper who pushed the ball. John Stones, still him, followed well and scored his second goal of the day (40th). Just before the break, on a corner, Godoy girded, took Harry Kane to the ground, before giving him a shot: penalty. Harry Kane did justice himself and scored his second goal of the day, too, shooting in the same hole as his first penalty.
24/06/2018, 17:35 - David;: 'the head of sterling came knocking'. 'John Stones, still him' lol
24/06/2018, 17:35 - David;: 'shooting in the same hole'
24/06/2018, 17:39 - David;: "The Three Lions crushed Panama (6-1) and composted their tickets for the second phase of the 2018 World Cup."
24/06/2018, 19:32 - Rob;: From my mate Freddie, 'The skylight thing is interesting: apparently in Brazil they talk about a shot going ‚Äúwhere the owl sleeps‚Äù if it goes in the top corner. Could be similar?
24/06/2018, 19:34 - Rob;: 'Where the owl sleeps', another novel
24/06/2018, 19:36 - Phill: This was on radio 4 recently

24/06/2018, 20:48 - Rob;: I've developed a system where I can watch it from the hammock on the balcony

24/06/2018, 21:04 - Rob;: Did Roy just burp live on air?
24/06/2018, 21:06 - Rob;: Ah no, just a huge on-mic cough from elsewhere
25/06/2018, 13:46 - David;: This format change. The simulteneous games. Did you take half days deliberately for that purpose?
25/06/2018, 13:54 - Sam;: Its always been simultaneous. You‚Äôve always been the caretaker
25/06/2018, 13:56 - Damian Rumble: Eurasia has always been at war with Oceania...
25/06/2018, 14:07 - David;: So now we get 90 minutes more football but 90 minutes less gumpable football.
25/06/2018, 14:07 - David;: The absorbtion rate of the world cup into my eyeballs has gone down in efficiency
25/06/2018, 14:08 - David;: By fully 50%
25/06/2018, 14:10 - Rob;: It's just a convenient time in the mag schedule, plus I clocked the weather was going to be great and games are still at a high frequency
25/06/2018, 14:49 - David;: Want Russia to get schooled by Uruguay
25/06/2018, 15:09 - Rob;: Hoooonkkk

8-ball of coke
8-ball of coke
25/06/2018, 18:52 - Rob;: Which game to watch?
25/06/2018, 18:52 - Rob;: Going to have to double screen this
25/06/2018, 19:07 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
25/06/2018, 19:12 - Paul Dickinson: Could you have got a smaller tv stand?
25/06/2018, 19:15 - Rob;: All the furniture was a piece of shit when I got here. Have a new one on the way actually

25/06/2018, 19:19 - David;: Ronaldo vs the drones
25/06/2018, 19:39 - Damian Rumble: Portugal are shite. How did this team win the euros?
25/06/2018, 19:50 - Phill: Quaresma finesse
25/06/2018, 19:57 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/06/2018, 20:12 - Paul Dickinson: No one can score penalties anymore. More of a hindrance to have them
25/06/2018, 20:14 - / James Ball: You at Red Lion in Norton, Phil?
25/06/2018, 20:22 - Phill: <Media omitted>

25/06/2018, 20:49 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/06/2018, 20:51 - Rob;: This is the biggest farce
25/06/2018, 20:51 - Rob;: Is this sending Spain out if it goes in?
25/06/2018, 20:52 - Rob;: Ah Spain just equalised, so no
25/06/2018, 21:00 - Rob;: Mental refereeing
25/06/2018, 21:04 - Damian Rumble: Two appalling penalty decisions but at least they were consistently awful.
25/06/2018, 21:04 - Phill: Best world cup
25/06/2018, 21:04 - Phill: The GOAT Cup
25/06/2018, 21:05 - Paul Dickinson: Is this the best since France 98?
25/06/2018, 21:15 - Rob;: Being an adult is making me appreciate it more
25/06/2018, 21:15 - Rob;: It's certainly the best since we've been drinking
25/06/2018, 21:15 - Paul Dickinson: But there‚Äôs no vuvuzela, jabalani
25/06/2018, 21:16 - Rob;: It's had more of everything good, penalties, direct free kick goals. And less shit things like 0-0s. Still no 0-0s even!
25/06/2018, 21:20 - / James Ball: I watched the Spain game, was very enjoyable. As a non-fan watching matches, it's definitely a very entertaining world cup so far
25/06/2018, 21:23 - Damian Rumble: I love having the VAR. it just adds an extra dimension to the game whilst ensuring more fair outcomes/pundits losing thier shit when the ref gets the watch the same relays they do and come to the opposite conclusions.
25/06/2018, 21:25 - Rob;: It's being implemented terribly
25/06/2018, 21:30 - David;: Dat queresmo finish doe
26/06/2018, 11:51 - Phill: Who wants weed and how much for Wales?
26/06/2018, 12:03 - Hamish Sinclair: üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ

26/06/2018, 12:07 - David;: Yeah i'll go in on that - like  enough for 10 joints or so. ¬£15 worth?
26/06/2018, 12:08 - Phill: How much Hamish?
26/06/2018, 12:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Can't rmemebr how much you got last year but that was about right
26/06/2018, 12:33 - Stefan;: I'll take ¬£10 worth

26/06/2018, 12:51 - Damian Rumble: Please
26/06/2018, 13:03 - David;: Had a dream last night. Me and sambo had gone on a froust shop to a huge cash and carry so we had to buy everything in ridiculous quantities. We found a 450 bag multi-pack of walkers crisps, like a huge potato sack.
26/06/2018, 13:04 - David;: Costing 50 pounds.
26/06/2018, 13:04 - Jack G;: That would last a day in Wales probably
26/06/2018, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Woukd be like that froust at Damiens where we got really high and demolished his crisp cuoboard
26/06/2018, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Such devastation
26/06/2018, 13:05 - David;: Yeah, those would go over a Wales trip to be fair
26/06/2018, 13:05 - David;: Open season on the crisps. Like locusts
26/06/2018, 13:06 - David;: I mean that's probably only like 75 bags each over the holiday. 10-15  day. Not unreasonable even.
26/06/2018, 13:07 - Phill: Would get crisp fatigue
26/06/2018, 13:16 - Jack G;: Diminishing returns
26/06/2018, 15:34 - Paul Dickinson: What are the possible outcomes for the Argentina group?
26/06/2018, 15:34 - Rob;: Anyone can qualify
26/06/2018, 15:34 - Rob;: Croatia already have
26/06/2018, 15:39 - Rob;: A win can take any of the others through, although Argentina would need to beat Nigeria by one more than Iceland beat Croatia if they were to both win. A draw would be enough for Nigeria.
26/06/2018, 15:39 - David;: Really want nigeria to go through
26/06/2018, 15:40 - David;: Not argentina or the burnley of international teams
26/06/2018, 15:40 - Rob;: Yeah me too
26/06/2018, 15:40 - Rob;: Although of all the shithouse teams, Iceland seem the most likeable
26/06/2018, 15:44 - David;: If nigeria draw and iceland win by 3 or more they are fucked

26/06/2018, 17:36 - Paul Dickinson: England got a nice easy run to the final
26/06/2018, 17:36 - Phill: England FC will score the soccer and triumph the world trophy.
26/06/2018, 17:39 - Phill: Fuck imagine an England final. In Wales.
26/06/2018, 17:39 - David;: Really need mexico to top group f
26/06/2018, 17:40 - David;: And brazil to win theirs. Then we play winner of Mex vs Switzerland in quarters
26/06/2018, 17:41 - Phill: Dave I'm doing a lecture to a load of fucking student at Cardiff university tomorrow. Any tips?
26/06/2018, 17:41 - Phill: Should I do a shit before?

26/06/2018, 17:43 - David;: Dont drink coffee
26/06/2018, 17:44 - David;: Yeah or shit yourself during the lecture? Bold, provocative
26/06/2018, 17:47 - Phill: Was thinking if they see me shit, they'll forget about the difficult questions they were going to ask
26/06/2018, 17:47 - Phill: Would rather shit myself than flap about not knowing the answer
26/06/2018, 17:48 - Phill: Fill the theatre with the acrid stench
26/06/2018, 17:48 - Phill: Any questions?

26/06/2018, 18:04 - Paul Dickinson: What are you lecturing them on? Can you switch it to a lecture on how to shit yourself giving a lecture?
26/06/2018, 18:15 - Phill: It's a lecture on coastal engineering.
26/06/2018, 18:15 - David;: Colonic engineering
26/06/2018, 18:15 - David;: Say you got the wrong topic

26/06/2018, 18:45 - David;: This match has corners written all over it?
26/06/2018, 18:46 - Paul Dickinson: The worst Argentina team ever. Have Messi. Apparently the best player ever. Messi is dump
26/06/2018, 18:46 - Paul Dickinson: A conman
26/06/2018, 18:49 - David;: Both teams to have same number of corners - 10/1
26/06/2018, 18:50 - David;: Probably will happen?
26/06/2018, 18:50 - Jack G;: >betting on corners
26/06/2018, 19:00 - David;: If each team gets over 3 corners in each half i get ¬£300
26/06/2018, 19:11 - David;: What's this VR shit anyway?
26/06/2018, 19:12 - Rob;: I imagine it's 360 camera you can control yourself
26/06/2018, 19:12 - Rob;: If you have a headset

26/06/2018, 20:09 - Rob;: Ighalo doing basically what Paul did the night he started that brawl that engulfed the King's Arms
26/06/2018, 20:09 - Damian Rumble: Well this is delicious...
26/06/2018, 20:17 - Phill: Nigeria's first touch, throughout the team, is hilariously gimp
26/06/2018, 20:19 - David;: Hiiiiib
26/06/2018, 20:19 - David;: Bet on a draw too. ¬£33 if it stays like this

26/06/2018, 20:33 - Phill: Like a thicc Latino and a lithe Scandinavian.
26/06/2018, 20:33 - David;: Yeah that's what i thought. Love the home but they've only worn once
26/06/2018, 20:33 - Rob;: Ighalo!
26/06/2018, 20:34 - David;: Mad one
26/06/2018, 20:34 - Phill: VARBARVAR
26/06/2018, 20:34 - Rob;: Iceland have equalised
26/06/2018, 20:34 - Rob;: Changes... Nothing?
26/06/2018, 20:35 - David;: How the fuck can they not give this after portugal though?
26/06/2018, 20:35 - Phill: I fucking love VAR
26/06/2018, 20:35 - David;: Theu've fucked themselfves
26/06/2018, 20:36 - Rob;: That's more of a pen than the Iran one
26/06/2018, 20:37 - Phill: Yeah but >referee in the Iran game
26/06/2018, 20:37 - Rob;: Yeah, we can't be using him as a yardstick
26/06/2018, 20:37 - Phill: I'm sorry sir this yardstick is in fact 8 yards
26/06/2018, 20:38 - Phill: DO ARGENTINA NEED A GOAL I NEED TO KNOW
26/06/2018, 20:38 - David;: Yes
26/06/2018, 20:39 - David;: Definitely, always have needed to win the game. Draw is nothing for them
26/06/2018, 20:39 - Phill: Thought so, but I wasn't sure what the status of Nigeria and Iceland were regarding goals scored etc
26/06/2018, 20:40 - Phill: Dave who's your favourite dint on love island?
26/06/2018, 20:40 - Rob;: Nigeria started the game with 3 points to the other's 1 each
26/06/2018, 20:41 - Damian Rumble: How's that corner count coming along?
26/06/2018, 20:41 - Rob;: The watty on Love Island is post fit. They've all wrecked themselves.
26/06/2018, 20:42 - Phill: Rate Georgia these days. Dat ass.
26/06/2018, 20:43 - Phill: The face when I just sharted
26/06/2018, 20:44 - Damian Rumble: >Not starting one of the premier league's top goal scorers
26/06/2018, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Ah fuck
26/06/2018, 20:47 - Rob;: A late goal for Iceland could sent them through?
26/06/2018, 20:48 - Rob;: Ah, not now Croatia are winning again
26/06/2018, 20:49 - Paul Dickinson: This is just boring now. World Cup is over
26/06/2018, 20:50 - Rob;: Only if all you want is disruption of the accepted order
26/06/2018, 20:50 - Sam;: That‚Äôs all paul has ever wanted
26/06/2018, 20:51 - Paul Dickinson: Yes silly question
26/06/2018, 20:54 - Damian Rumble: Tasty Ro16 France Vs Argentina
26/06/2018, 20:54 - Paul Dickinson: Would you describe it as spicy?
26/06/2018, 20:54 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
26/06/2018, 20:54 - Rob;: Three arms, two watches
26/06/2018, 20:56 - Damian Rumble: Very spicy
26/06/2018, 20:56 - Phill: <Media omitted>
26/06/2018, 21:04 - David;: Yeah most of the contestants seem like they've had surgery. Too much make up
26/06/2018, 21:08 - David;: Probably Zara?
26/06/2018, 21:13 - Phill: <Media omitted>

26/06/2018, 21:26 - Sam;: Ad be lyin if a said she wasn atrac‚Äôiv
26/06/2018, 21:27 - Sam;: Hayley was cheeky but thick as shit
26/06/2018, 21:27 - Phill: [26/06, 21:04] Dave: Yeah most of the contestants seem like they've had surgery. Too much make up
[26/06, 21:25] Dave: Did like rosie
26/06/2018, 21:28 - Sam;: The lip fillers on that
26/06/2018, 21:29 - David;: Yeah but at least not generic blonde
26/06/2018, 21:29 - Phill: True.
26/06/2018, 21:29 - David;: The black hair masked it
26/06/2018, 21:29 - David;: I'm sticking with samira overall
26/06/2018, 21:30 - Phill: Yeah I'm Georgia no.1 (dat ass) Samira no.2
26/06/2018, 21:30 - David;: I'm really in the 'anyone but meghan' camp
26/06/2018, 21:30 - David;: Ah. Georgia. No
26/06/2018, 21:30 - David;: Last place
26/06/2018, 21:30 - Phill: Her face is pretty dodgy but her body is the best on there
26/06/2018, 21:31 - David;: Beyond dodgy. Rotten
26/06/2018, 21:31 - Phill: Ellie is rotten now
26/06/2018, 21:33 - David;: 'Girls that are nice and like us for being nice'
26/06/2018, 21:35 - Phill: >donkey dick wes
26/06/2018, 21:35 - David;: I mean we dont need to mention Laura
26/06/2018, 21:36 - Phill: Eyal pied üòÇ
26/06/2018, 21:40 - Phill: Fuck Meghan
26/06/2018, 21:44 - Phill: Yeah Laura rank
26/06/2018, 21:44 - Paul Dickinson: Is this show just rutting?
26/06/2018, 21:45 - Phill: Nah it's the absence of rutting that keeps the intrigue going
26/06/2018, 21:46 - Phill: There's a bit of rutting
26/06/2018, 21:46 - Phill: But it's a footnote
26/06/2018, 21:47 - Phill: It's just accelerated relationships
26/06/2018, 21:47 - Phill: The boom busy cycle, at lightspeed, for all to see
26/06/2018, 21:47 - Phill: Boom bust*
26/06/2018, 21:49 - Phill: Meghan is an absolute sow

26/06/2018, 22:12 - Rob;: What is politics now?
26/06/2018, 22:21 - Stefan;: This.
26/06/2018, 22:21 - Stefan;: Neil Hamilton taking on Twitter like a 4chan creep
26/06/2018, 22:21 - Stefan;: *talking
26/06/2018, 22:40 - Phill: You sound triggered
26/06/2018, 22:51 - Damian Rumble: Surely that cannot be the real thing
26/06/2018, 22:51 - Damian Rumble: >behaving as if UKIP still exists
27/06/2018, 10:06 - David;: Those fucking guys in toilets who seem to be gasping for air, grunting and taking huge lungfuls under the strain as if running the finishing mile of an iron man.
27/06/2018, 10:06 - David;: You're just taking a fucking shit!
27/06/2018, 10:25 - Damian Rumble: I finally worked out what GOAT means today...
27/06/2018, 10:26 - Damian Rumble: #21stCenturyProblems
27/06/2018, 10:26 - Rob;: Why didn't you Google it?
27/06/2018, 10:27 - Damian Rumble: Tbh I thought it was Phil-ism
27/06/2018, 10:29 - David;: <Media omitted>
27/06/2018, 10:29 - Phill: It's a 4chan ism from over a decade ago, stemming from the sport section where they made a team of GOATS and used the FC Cologne goat logo, thats recently become mainstream
27/06/2018, 10:30 - Phill: <Media omitted>
27/06/2018, 14:28 - Paul Dickinson: Small games today
27/06/2018, 14:53 - David;: It's just going to somehow end up with all the favourites qualifying isn't it?
27/06/2018, 14:54 - David;: Doesnt matter what they do
27/06/2018, 14:54 - David;: Kroos control
27/06/2018, 14:54 - Paul Dickinson: Most boring World Cup ever
27/06/2018, 14:54 - David;: Yeah. Predictable
27/06/2018, 14:54 - Paul Dickinson: Screenshot that for when England win though
27/06/2018, 14:55 - David;: Neymar upsets in store today
27/06/2018, 14:56 - Rob;: At least a few have drawn eachother. We'll lose two of France, Argentina, Portugal and Uruguay in the next round
27/06/2018, 15:05 - David;: We actually really want brazil to win their group
27/06/2018, 15:05 - David;: Then we dont meet them in quarters
27/06/2018, 15:06 - Damian Rumble: Is that if we win?
27/06/2018, 15:06 - David;: Yeah i plotted out if we were to top our group (big assumption)
27/06/2018, 15:07 - David;: Amd Brazil winning and germany coming 2nd would mean we couldnt meet either of them until semis
27/06/2018, 15:08 - Damian Rumble: And Germany need +3 goal win over SK and Mexico to lose to win thier group.
27/06/2018, 15:10 - David;: Yeah
27/06/2018, 15:10 - David;: And brazil should win
27/06/2018, 15:14 - Damian Rumble: Annoyingly I'm at a festival the weekend of the quarter finals. Will probably have to take my work phone and abuse b the data on that by streaming the match. (Making the big assumption that we don't cock it up on the Ro16).
27/06/2018, 15:15 - Phill: >Ro16
27/06/2018, 16:10 - Jack G;: Germany out as it stands
27/06/2018, 16:24 - Rob;: Not a dive there by Son
27/06/2018, 16:44 - Sam;: BREAKING: AC Milan banned from next seasons europa league due to FFP infractions
27/06/2018, 16:47 - Rob;: Not quite the punishment intended perhaps
27/06/2018, 16:47 - Rob;: Germany are going out in a very England way
27/06/2018, 16:50 - Paul Dickinson: 6mins added time
27/06/2018, 16:50 - Sam;: Well that‚Äôs the tournament ac Milan qualified for
27/06/2018, 16:50 - Sam;: VAR!!
27/06/2018, 16:50 - Paul Dickinson: The hun obviously going to qualify
27/06/2018, 16:51 - Rob;: Clear goal
27/06/2018, 16:51 - Rob;: Justice
27/06/2018, 16:52 - Sam;: YAAAAS
27/06/2018, 16:52 - Paul Dickinson: Ah great
27/06/2018, 16:53 - Hamish Sinclair: JuSTICE
27/06/2018, 16:55 - Sam;: Accepted order disrupted
27/06/2018, 16:55 - Rob;: Fucking more justice
27/06/2018, 16:56 - Paul Dickinson: Best World Cup
27/06/2018, 16:57 - Phill: >nazi Germany
27/06/2018, 16:57 - Phill: >the turd Reich
27/06/2018, 16:58 - Sam;: Unbelievable Jeff
27/06/2018, 16:58 - Rob;: Love how much South Korea love being huge trolls
27/06/2018, 16:59 - Paul Dickinson: When did they last fail to make it through
27/06/2018, 16:59 - Paul Dickinson: Bunch of wankers
27/06/2018, 16:59 - Paul Dickinson: Justice

27/06/2018, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: üçÜüí¶
27/06/2018, 17:01 - Stefan;: Who lets in 2 goals in stoppage time on 0-0
27/06/2018, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Love how it wasn't just a loss it was embaressinh
27/06/2018, 17:04 - Stefan;: And there's no benefit to South Korea
27/06/2018, 17:04 - Stefan;: 100% troll
27/06/2018, 17:05 - Rob;: That ball for the final goal is fantastic
27/06/2018, 17:05 - Rob;: Does this put Switzerland into our potential path?
27/06/2018, 17:07 - Paul Dickinson: üá©üá™üëàüèªüñïüèª
27/06/2018, 17:07 - Paul Dickinson: Goalnomey
27/06/2018, 17:08 - Paul Dickinson: Germany have never been eliminated at the group stage
27/06/2018, 17:09 - Stefan;: Don't mention the Var
27/06/2018, 17:11 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
27/06/2018, 17:11 - Damian Rumble: Champions Germany finish bottom of their group. Beaten by already eliminated south Korea. What is football
27/06/2018, 17:11 - Sam;: Lol. Already a great WW2 joke to go with it.
27/06/2018, 17:12 - Paul Dickinson: Best World Cup. Always said that
27/06/2018, 17:13 - / James Ball: Very good match. I'm also happy to see Sweden through
27/06/2018, 17:13 - / James Ball: I'm currently working with two Swedes, they were pretty happy as well
27/06/2018, 17:14 - Damian Rumble: I'm going to Berlin tomorrow. That's going to be a barrel of laughs...
27/06/2018, 17:14 - / James Ball: I'm going to South Africa tomorrow - no world cup link there though
27/06/2018, 17:16 - Paul Dickinson: The curse of the defending champions
27/06/2018, 17:16 - Paul Dickinson: 4th of the last 5 reigning champs to go out in group phase. Should have actually been very predictable
27/06/2018, 17:21 - Damian Rumble: Hopefully Brazil can chump it as well this evening...
27/06/2018, 17:42 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
27/06/2018, 17:44 - Phill: üëçüèæ

27/06/2018, 18:08 - Paul Dickinson: Put that in your Reich and smoke it
27/06/2018, 18:13 - Damian Rumble: I have to say part is a little sad that don't get to watch Germany and Brazil rematch in the Ro16 but a larger part of me doesn't give a fuck.
27/06/2018, 18:14 - Damian Rumble: Anyhoo the France/Portugal/uraguay/Argentina will shit storm enough.
27/06/2018, 19:59 - Phill: Apology for poor English

27/06/2018, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: If   it's better for England finish runners up, it puts a great spin on daves yellow card/fair play situation. If England are drawing come 89th minute we'd have to get two people booked to finish runners up
27/06/2018, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Send on wellbeck just to get a red card
27/06/2018, 20:57 - Sam;: So we know our potential QF opponents then. Sweden/Switzerland if were  runner up or Brazil/Mexico on the winner side of the draw
27/06/2018, 20:58 - Phill: It's going to be such a shit game
27/06/2018, 20:58 - Phill: I think all the final group games should be played at the same time
27/06/2018, 20:59 - Phill: Or do another draw
27/06/2018, 20:59 - Paul Dickinson: Would rather have Brazil/Mexico
27/06/2018, 20:59 - Phill: You're a cunt though
27/06/2018, 21:00 - Paul Dickinson: That‚Äôs easier than Switzerland/Sweden
27/06/2018, 21:00 - Paul Dickinson: The frailty of South America
27/06/2018, 21:00 - Phill: Said the cunt
27/06/2018, 21:00 - Damian Rumble: Ummmm hello... Mexico 0 Sweden 3
27/06/2018, 21:00 - Damian Rumble: Brazil will walk that match
27/06/2018, 21:01 - Jack G;: We can beat Brazil
27/06/2018, 21:01 - Hamish Sinclair: By kick off tomorrow we will know who is going to be our 2nd round aswell
27/06/2018, 21:01 - Sam;: Brazil haven‚Äôt looked great either. I think we‚Äôd score a couple against them
27/06/2018, 21:01 - Hamish Sinclair: If Japan end up winning grouo then I don't think you can make an argument against losing the game
27/06/2018, 21:37 - Phill: Meghan is a fucking sow
27/06/2018, 21:38 - Phill: They should send her into the fields to go rooting for fungus

28/06/2018, 14:12 - Rob;: 'Wine'
28/06/2018, 14:55 - Rob;: My big plan of watching the match at the British embassy bar in Brussels with Steve has been completely scuppered. His flight back from a conference has been delayed by two hours and will miss the match
28/06/2018, 14:55 - Rob;: > travelling to another country to watch a match alone in a pub
28/06/2018, 14:56 - Phill: Lel
28/06/2018, 14:57 - David;: >devising an internatonal liaison plan with less than 2 hours margin for error built in
28/06/2018, 14:59 - Paul Dickinson: Lol the 2 hour window
28/06/2018, 14:59 - Rob;: Yeah it was an unfortunate thing, the conference was organised after this
28/06/2018, 14:59 - Paul Dickinson: So now you get to sit alone
28/06/2018, 15:00 - Jack G;: Belgian beer though
28/06/2018, 15:00 - Jack G;: üëç
28/06/2018, 15:00 - David;: But hold on the match is about 2 hours, so before this was he going to just arrive on the dot of kick-off?
28/06/2018, 15:00 - Paul Dickinson: Good point
28/06/2018, 15:00 - Paul Dickinson: No margin for error
28/06/2018, 15:01 - David;: Zero error. Complete confidence in the timetable.
28/06/2018, 15:01 - Rob;: Yeah
28/06/2018, 15:01 - Paul Dickinson: Impossible to leave the conference earlier
28/06/2018, 15:03 - Rob;: Like I say when we planned it he was going to be abroad at all
28/06/2018, 15:03 - Rob;: *wasn't
28/06/2018, 15:03 - Damian Rumble: Do you still get to go to the embassy?
28/06/2018, 15:03 - David;: Unfortunate. You should just get really pissed and intrude into a group of quiet belgium fans.
28/06/2018, 15:03 - David;: Be that guy. The loud english bloke
28/06/2018, 15:04 - Rob;: No the embassy is off
28/06/2018, 15:04 - Damian Rumble: Loud and lary
28/06/2018, 15:04 - Rob;: Loud Larry
28/06/2018, 15:04 - David;: Also now watching a game that we potentially want to lose.
28/06/2018, 15:04 - Damian Rumble: It'll probably be a full 0-0. Great for watching on your own.
28/06/2018, 15:05 - Damian Rumble: *dull
28/06/2018, 15:05 - Rob;: I will probably just stand quietly somewhere and get fractionally pissed
28/06/2018, 15:05 - David;: Are you staying around for the weekend fixtures though?
28/06/2018, 15:05 - Damian Rumble: Nah just get on a train and join me in Berlin
28/06/2018, 15:05 - Damian Rumble: Basically next door right?
28/06/2018, 15:05 - David;: Oh, hib. Could you make it to Berlin Rob?
28/06/2018, 15:06 - David;: Little train over. The great European tour.
28/06/2018, 15:06 - Damian Rumble: We're going to be watching it in West Berlin as well
28/06/2018, 15:06 - David;: Make it to kalliningrad
28/06/2018, 15:06 - Jack G;: Nah that‚Äôs about 7 hours I think?
28/06/2018, 15:06 - David;: So Belgium it is.
28/06/2018, 15:07 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>

28/06/2018, 15:13 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, lots planned, day trip to Gent tomorrow then extended football gumping throughout the weekend. Berlin an unlikely venture
28/06/2018, 15:14 - David;: Gump in Gent?
28/06/2018, 15:14 - David;: Get bent in Gent
28/06/2018, 15:15 - Paul Dickinson: Bent gents in Gent
28/06/2018, 15:26 - Rob;: Went to Gent to stay in a tent with some bent gents during Lent to vent about the state of Kent
28/06/2018, 15:29 - Sam;: The fucking state of it
28/06/2018, 15:30 - David;: Facking 'el fire
28/06/2018, 16:03 - Damian Rumble: I'm pretty sure I did that last year...
28/06/2018, 16:03 - Damian Rumble: But it all seriousness gent is lovely.
28/06/2018, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: Get yourself a seat at a bar by the canal and settle in for a day of tasting 12% beers
28/06/2018, 16:05 - Phill: >beer with a higher ABV than wine
28/06/2018, 16:05 - Phill: Not even once.
28/06/2018, 16:05 - Rob;: That is the plan. It's hotter there than the UK
28/06/2018, 16:45 - / James Ball: Ghent?
28/06/2018, 16:49 - Rob;: Get bhent
28/06/2018, 16:51 - Sam;: Lawro is such a cock.
28/06/2018, 16:55 - Damian Rumble: That's Senegal out right?
28/06/2018, 16:55 - Damian Rumble: Definitely the team I least wanted to play from that group
28/06/2018, 16:56 - Rob;: So is it Japan if we win the group and Colombia if we don't?
28/06/2018, 16:57 - Rob;: Definitely worth winning I think. Momentum and it makes the next round easier. Can't think too far beyond that yet
28/06/2018, 16:57 - David;: Well that throws that cat amonst the cunts, doesn't it?
28/06/2018, 16:59 - David;: I think I would still overall be in the other side of the draw: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44620166
28/06/2018, 16:59 - Paul Dickinson: Can‚Äôt wait for weekend of game and watch
28/06/2018, 16:59 - David;: Go down to where they trace the dfferent paths. If we come second we could still have winnable fixtures even in the semis.
28/06/2018, 17:00 - David;: I take a slightly tricky colombia tie for that
28/06/2018, 17:12 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/06/2018, 17:14 - / James Ball: I thought it was a big black dong from the thumbnail
28/06/2018, 17:24 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/06/2018, 17:26 - Sam;: Beat the customer into submission

28/06/2018, 17:37 - Sam;: 32.6 degrees centigrade in port maddog
28/06/2018, 17:38 - Paul Dickinson: Must be a record?
28/06/2018, 17:38 - Paul Dickinson: How is the uk so hot
28/06/2018, 17:38 - Paul Dickinson: Rainy overcast uk that‚Äôs what I want
28/06/2018, 17:42 - Sam;: It‚Äôs barmy here. Tans all round
28/06/2018, 17:45 - Rob;: Lol. Balmy
28/06/2018, 17:45 - Rob;: The balmy army
28/06/2018, 17:45 - Sam;: >balmy. Embalmed
28/06/2018, 17:47 - David;: Blighty.

28/06/2018, 17:51 - Sam;: No lane
28/06/2018, 17:51 - Sam;: Kane
28/06/2018, 17:51 - Paul Dickinson: But Blane
28/06/2018, 17:51 - Jack G;: Larry Lane
28/06/2018, 17:51 - Sam;: Rashford and vardy up front

28/06/2018, 17:51 - Paul Dickinson: Shop he should open
28/06/2018, 17:51 - Sam;: Cahill Jones and stone
28/06/2018, 17:52 - Sam;: Trent and rose at wing back
28/06/2018, 17:52 - Sam;: Pickford in goal
28/06/2018, 17:56 - Sam;: Lofty cheeko as well
28/06/2018, 18:07 - David;: Phil jones. Facking el
28/06/2018, 18:07 - David;: Chucking the game then
28/06/2018, 18:08 - David;: Vardy could be good against a team that leaves space behind defence
28/06/2018, 18:10 - Sam;: Their team is pretty weak. The back three.. dendoncker is a midfielder! And only for anderlecht
28/06/2018, 18:11 - Sam;: Thorgan hazard playing over Eden..
28/06/2018, 18:13 - Sam;: Courtious dembele and fellaini are the only ones who play in a top league
28/06/2018, 18:13 - Sam;: Apart from the wingers but they‚Äôre Chadli and januzaj
28/06/2018, 18:14 - Jack G;: Fellaini and Januzaj starting, very Van Gaal
28/06/2018, 18:17 - Rob;: Men behaving Chadli
28/06/2018, 18:19 - Rob;: Remember the time when people got excited about the possibility of Januzaj spending years uncapped for Belgium and nationalising then playing for England
28/06/2018, 18:19 - Rob;: A long shot on both his loyalties and his potential really
28/06/2018, 18:33 - Rob;: I have ended up amongst a loaf of Belgians. Even in the London Tavern
28/06/2018, 18:34 - Rob;: Can't turn your nose up at 3.5 Euros a pint in a capital city though
28/06/2018, 18:34 - Phill: WHEN I GET OLDER
28/06/2018, 18:34 - Phill: I WILL BE STRONGER
28/06/2018, 18:34 - Phill: THEY'LL CALL ME FREEDOM
28/06/2018, 18:34 - Phill: JUST LIKE A WAVING FLAG
28/06/2018, 18:42 - Rob;: Is Thorgen Hazard actually good?
28/06/2018, 18:43 - Phill: Ask a local
28/06/2018, 18:44 - Rob;: Not blowing my cover yet. I've done extremely well so far.
28/06/2018, 18:45 - Sam;: Average. On loan from Chelsea to monchengladbach
28/06/2018, 18:45 - Phill: Nah you should definitely play your lonely Brit card
28/06/2018, 18:46 - Phill: "my mate pied me off üò≠"
28/06/2018, 18:46 - Paul Dickinson: Maybe they are all undercover as well
28/06/2018, 18:46 - Phill: Just leverage your situation for sympathy
28/06/2018, 18:46 - Phill: (they don't have to know it was the airlines fault)
28/06/2018, 18:47 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôm impressed just how well your plan unraveled
28/06/2018, 18:47 - Paul Dickinson: And he doesn‚Äôt know a single other English person you could team up with?
28/06/2018, 18:47 - Paul Dickinson: A loaner
28/06/2018, 18:50 - Rob;: Tbh I would probably prefer watching alone to having a sort of football Tinder date
28/06/2018, 18:50 - Rob;: Quite fun people watching
28/06/2018, 18:51 - Paul Dickinson: >not realising everyone actually just watching you
28/06/2018, 18:51 - Rob;: They really go in for fancy dress here. I'd say 1 in 4 have red devil's horns
28/06/2018, 18:51 - Jack G;: What if you celebrate too hard when Vardy lobs courtois and your cover is blown though?
28/06/2018, 18:52 - Paul Dickinson: You should be on your 6th pint of carling by now
28/06/2018, 18:52 - Sam;: Then he gets the glory of fighting his way out
28/06/2018, 18:53 - Paul Dickinson: Come up with a drunken chant related to neutral Belgium
28/06/2018, 18:53 - Rob;: I've had a lot of practice watching Arsenal in a pub full of fans of other London clubs. I've learnt to keep a lid of my otherwise combustible personality
28/06/2018, 18:54 - Phill: My mate at work was telling me that in his first lecture at uni, they did an ice breaker by introducing themselves, the last guy just started chanting "BALE, BALE, BALE, BALE" and didn't stop. Eventually got asked to leave and just carried on chanting as he left.
28/06/2018, 18:54 - Jack G;: That guys name? Albert Einstein
28/06/2018, 18:54 - Rob;: And he's never forgotten it. Worked a charm
28/06/2018, 18:57 - Phill: <Media omitted>
28/06/2018, 18:58 - Phill: How many corners you got Dave?
28/06/2018, 18:59 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm imaging Dave not caring about goals but just celebrating every time there‚Äôs a corner.
28/06/2018, 19:03 - Sam;: David muller
28/06/2018, 19:06 - Rob;: I've been writing match reports for the sweepstake email group at work and was hoping to use Muller's Crunch Corner at some point. I'm one of the bigger victims of Germany's exit.
28/06/2018, 19:13 - Phill: Trent showing his class so far
28/06/2018, 19:18 - Jack G;: Fellaini = cunt
28/06/2018, 19:19 - Jack G;: Belgium 2 yellows ahead now
28/06/2018, 19:27 - Damian Rumble: Does that mean we are second? That's a good thing right?
28/06/2018, 19:29 - Rob;: No, first on fair play
28/06/2018, 19:34 - Phill: >wanting to finish second
28/06/2018, 19:34 - Phill: Very Arsenal
28/06/2018, 19:34 - Rob;: Lol the man next to me has a whistle specifically to heckle anyone who stands in front of the screen
28/06/2018, 19:41 - / James Ball: Best to come prepared
28/06/2018, 19:47 - Damian Rumble: Christ this dull. How long until we put it our own net just to liven it up?
28/06/2018, 19:56 - Sam;: When you post a picture of you deepthroating your own  cock, England will do that
28/06/2018, 19:59 - Rob;: We're all waiting Damian
28/06/2018, 20:10 - Rob;: Ghent Alexander-Arnold
28/06/2018, 20:12 - Damian Rumble: Mission accomplished
28/06/2018, 20:12 - David;: You're not speaking german cause of us. You're not speaking german cause of us. You're not speaking german, you're not speaking, you're not speaking german cause of us'
28/06/2018, 20:12 - David;: Shouted
28/06/2018, 20:13 - Sam;: Quality. Round it off with ‚Äúyou cunts‚Äù
28/06/2018, 20:14 - Rob;: Let me just do that and get back to you
28/06/2018, 20:20 - Rob;: They loved it. They're carrying me on their shoulders now like I'm their king.
28/06/2018, 20:25 - Damian Rumble: Pics or it didn't happen
28/06/2018, 20:33 - Jack G;: >Welbeck
28/06/2018, 20:48 - Rob;: Steve's here then
28/06/2018, 20:48 - Rob;: Just in time
28/06/2018, 20:48 - Jack G;: Just in time for the final whistle
28/06/2018, 20:59 - David;: Tell him he missed a thriller
29/06/2018, 00:38 - Sam;: What a cunt
29/06/2018, 07:55 - Phill: <Media omitted>
29/06/2018, 11:20 - David;: <Media omitted>
29/06/2018, 11:38 - Phill: Paul is Maradona

29/06/2018, 11:38 - Phill: Huge bag of coke next to him
29/06/2018, 13:48 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
29/06/2018, 13:49 - Phill: Do you need scores?
29/06/2018, 13:49 - Paul Dickinson: Only the final
29/06/2018, 13:50 - Paul Dickinson: Otherwise just who‚Äôs going to win
29/06/2018, 13:50 - Phill: Uruguay, France, Brazil Belgium
29/06/2018, 13:50 - Phill: Spain, croatia, Switzerland, England
29/06/2018, 13:50 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôve gone exact opposite
29/06/2018, 13:51 - Rob;: Lol
29/06/2018, 13:51 - Phill: Then France, Belgium, Croatia England
29/06/2018, 13:51 - Phill: Then Belgium, England
29/06/2018, 13:51 - Rob;: Belgium to beat Brazil?
29/06/2018, 13:51 - Phill: 2-1 Belgium crushing final
29/06/2018, 13:51 - Phill: Yeah >Brazil
29/06/2018, 13:51 - Rob;: I think Belgium me ght choke then and Brazil will find their spark
29/06/2018, 13:53 - Paul Dickinson: Belgium Croatia final
29/06/2018, 15:13 - Paul Dickinson: Mexico beating Brazil. Can‚Äôt wait for that
29/06/2018, 15:15 - Damian Rumble: One of the things I've really come to appreciate from this world cup is the ability of football to troll
30/06/2018, 15:01 - Sam;: Finally, get my fix
30/06/2018, 15:01 - Sam;: Itching for a score of World Cup
30/06/2018, 15:19 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
30/06/2018, 15:42 - Rob;: Hooting hellfire
30/06/2018, 15:42 - Rob;: The bloot on that
30/06/2018, 15:42 - Rob;: Slave to the boom
30/06/2018, 15:43 - Damian Rumble: Turns out there are a lot of Argentinians here. And they loved that
30/06/2018, 15:57 - Rob;: So many french in Brussels
30/06/2018, 15:57 - Rob;: The anthem was huge
30/06/2018, 16:13 - Rob;: The French don't have a phrase for 'bottling it', I'm told
30/06/2018, 16:16 - Rob;: Ah. Maybe that's why
30/06/2018, 16:16 - Rob;: The Spin Doctor
30/06/2018, 16:16 - Jack G;: Blooted in again
30/06/2018, 16:23 - Damian Rumble: This is a bit of match eh
30/06/2018, 16:29 - Rob;: Hib
30/06/2018, 16:30 - Rob;: Truth
30/06/2018, 16:41 - Sam;: Paul Trump. Make opposing points and you‚Äôll always be right
30/06/2018, 16:50 - Rob;: This. Game.
30/06/2018, 16:55 - Jack G;: Just the 7 goals then
30/06/2018, 16:56 - Rob;: This is our life now
30/06/2018, 17:08 - Damian Rumble: I cannot deal with a football match that has less that 7 goals. Just no
30/06/2018, 18:47 - Phill: Savage. 5 live. pissed.
30/06/2018, 18:47 - Phill: YHESE TEAMS
 PORTUGAL. ARGENTINA. FRANCRM SPAIN
30/06/2018, 18:47 - Phill: THEY AINT GREAT
30/06/2018, 18:47 - Phill: THEY AINT GOT A MARADON
01/07/2018, 17:35 - Damian Rumble: This might actually be the first time I genuinely want Russia to win
01/07/2018, 17:40 - Sam;: This is mental
01/07/2018, 17:44 - Rob;: Huge
01/07/2018, 17:44 - Rob;: Who's even in Thai side of the draw now
01/07/2018, 17:44 - Rob;: *this
01/07/2018, 17:44 - Phill: Loving ramos's butthurt little face
01/07/2018, 17:45 - Jack G;: Croatia probably the best team left on our side
01/07/2018, 17:46 - Rob;: I feel like everything is just going like this so the buttdevastation is total when we go out
01/07/2018, 17:47 - Phill: Got to.be favourites on our side of the draw to reach the final now?
01/07/2018, 17:54 - Damian Rumble: We're never going to get a better chance to win the world cup. I really hope our game with Columbia doesn't go the same way as this match
01/07/2018, 18:13 - David;: Yeah this is perfectly set up for a peno shootout defeat by colombia now
01/07/2018, 18:13 - David;: The hubris of trying to plot ahead will destroy us
01/07/2018, 18:14 - Rob;: A random draw after each round would help prevent hubris
01/07/2018, 18:14 - Rob;: Save us from ourselves
01/07/2018, 18:14 - David;: Would be intense as well
01/07/2018, 18:15 - Rob;: Possible a logistical nightmare? Given that there are just 2 days between each round
01/07/2018, 18:16 - David;: That's what's stopping it? The hotel bookings.
01/07/2018, 18:17 - David;: I guess for the fans rather than the teams it could be tricky.
01/07/2018, 18:17 - Rob;: Yeah
01/07/2018, 18:18 - Rob;: In a country like Russia the difference in flight times would be huge depending
01/07/2018, 18:18 - David;: But no different from now surely? I.e. fans didn't know where our last 16 would be until thursday
01/07/2018, 18:19 - Rob;: Ah yeah
01/07/2018, 18:19 - David;: Have to re-book at same notice
01/07/2018, 18:19 - Rob;: So it's only for the teams' benefit
01/07/2018, 18:19 - David;: Well teams as well. No one knew until you know who finishes 1st/2nd
01/07/2018, 18:20 - Rob;: In every other round you know though
01/07/2018, 18:21 - David;: You could draw the whole route to the final aftee the group stages - so including which last 16 matches end up playing which in quarters etc. Then there can still be forward planning but without you having any info at tge group stage
01/07/2018, 18:22 - David;: Basically the point is to get rid of england-belgium scenarios which that would do
01/07/2018, 18:22 - Rob;: Yeah that would be good
01/07/2018, 19:02 - Rob;: Tuned in 2 minutes late
01/07/2018, 19:02 - Rob;: Obviously missed a goal
01/07/2018, 19:09 - Damian Rumble: What is football
01/07/2018, 19:10 - David;: This. Particular. Tournament.
01/07/2018, 19:10 - David;: Simple. Metaphor.
01/07/2018, 20:37 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Hamish Sinclair: This is too much
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Rob;: That save
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Rob;: This drama
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Hamish Sinclair: How was that not a red
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Rob;: No double jeopardy any more
01/07/2018, 21:27 - David;: Put away the moon
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Such a good tackle
01/07/2018, 21:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Even though it's a foul
01/07/2018, 21:28 - Rob;: Yeah, turned an open goal situation from 5 yards into something much harder
01/07/2018, 21:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh the maths were all correct
01/07/2018, 21:39 - Rob;: Small pens
01/07/2018, 21:40 - Rob;: Big pen
01/07/2018, 21:44 - Jack G;: Great shootout
01/07/2018, 21:45 - Rob;: These run ups
01/07/2018, 21:45 - Jack G;: Very Zaza
01/07/2018, 21:53 - Rob;: Of the 20 winners of the world cup 11 are already out
01/07/2018, 21:53 - Rob;: 8 are in one half of the draw
01/07/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: 1 is in the other... ENG-GER-LAND
01/07/2018, 22:02 - Sam;: Bilic was proper sulking when they showed his reactions from during the game.
01/07/2018, 22:03 - Rob;: Looked like he might stab someone
01/07/2018, 22:03 - Rob;: You always get the impression Bilic might try to sell you a kidney from his jacket pocket
01/07/2018, 22:03 - Sam;: Yeah, or just take your kidney
01/07/2018, 22:20 - David;: Thqt must be wrong
01/07/2018, 22:23 - David;: Surely only brazil uruguay and france in the other half?
01/07/2018, 22:24 - Hamish Sinclair: I think Brazil counts as 5
01/07/2018, 22:24 - Hamish Sinclair: As in they've won it 5 times
01/07/2018, 22:24 - Hamish Sinclair: France once
01/07/2018, 22:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Uraguay twice
01/07/2018, 22:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Although jokes on them  cos uraguay have technically won it 4 times
01/07/2018, 22:25 - David;: Yeah but it was 'winners' not wins?
01/07/2018, 22:25 - David;: Okay so it is summing wins
01/07/2018, 22:26 - David;: Makes it more impressive to say there are only 4 past winners left in the tournament, 1 of them is england and the other 3 are in the other half of the draw
01/07/2018, 22:26 - Hamish Sinclair: True
01/07/2018, 22:30 - Rob;: I can't decide if we're definitely going out to Colombia or winning the whole thing. Those seem like the only two possible outcomes right now
01/07/2018, 22:30 - Paul Dickinson: Dat hubris
01/07/2018, 22:33 - Rob;: But the hubris is perfectly balanced out by the sense of inevitable failure
01/07/2018, 23:56 - Damian Rumble: Nah we'll grind out a spot in the final before getting pulverised by France. You heard it here first.
01/07/2018, 23:56 - Damian Rumble: 6-1
02/07/2018, 00:45 - David;: Obvious peno loss to Colombia. Don't even know why we're debating it.

02/07/2018, 19:37 - Sam;: Ah yeah, that‚Äôs there. Obviously Dickinson trolling..
02/07/2018, 19:38 - Damian Rumble: Bare in mind that should we get to the semis then England will play either in the final or 3rd place playoff
02/07/2018, 19:38 - Rob;: In the situation that definitely won't happen of England being in the final,  do we need to make a big plan?
02/07/2018, 19:38 - Sam;: I will bare it
02/07/2018, 19:39 - Paul Dickinson: >not going out in pennos to Colombia
02/07/2018, 19:40 - Sam;: Yes we do. Which is why I‚Äôm asking. Could be a once in a life time thing so I‚Äôm not going unprepared because we listened to the troll and naysayers. The forum dwellers

02/07/2018, 19:42 - Rob;: It's at 4pm

02/07/2018, 19:43 - Rob;: No, it just need to have a decent screen if it's England
02/07/2018, 19:43 - Phill: You can fuck right off if you think I'm taxiing people to.dolgellau for the final

02/07/2018, 19:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Less welsh
02/07/2018, 19:49 - Hamish Sinclair: More scummy
02/07/2018, 19:49 - David;: Only thing we need to negotiate is the potential local hostility
02/07/2018, 19:49 - David;: Okay, if and only if england make final.
02/07/2018, 19:49 - Rob;: Yeah I am absolutely fine for that pub if it isn't England
02/07/2018, 19:49 - David;: Would be a uniqie story having watched it in an incredibly welsh pub though

02/07/2018, 19:51 - Paul Dickinson: I actually predict the real issue will stem from Damian wearing a rugby shirt that causes great offense
02/07/2018, 19:51 - Sam;: Yeah
02/07/2018, 19:52 - David;: They absolutely loathe bath over there.
02/07/2018, 19:52 - David;: Its the one thing they just can't abide
02/07/2018, 19:55 - Paul Dickinson: We need some good chants though
02/07/2018, 19:57 - David;: Repeatedly chanting 'aaron ramsey's not that good, not that good, not that good. Aaron ramsey's not that good, and your inbred' - to tune of london bridge is falling down
02/07/2018, 19:58 - Paul Dickinson: Need one about slate/mining

02/07/2018, 20:07 - David;: Huge
02/07/2018, 20:09 - Sam;: Roberto Martinez is a shithouse.
02/07/2018, 20:11 - Jack G;: Yet another blooter
02/07/2018, 20:12 - Phill: Based Nippon
02/07/2018, 20:12 - Rob;: So is it Japan if we win the group and Colombia if we don't?
02/07/2018, 20:12 - Rob;: Definitely worth winning I think. Momentum and it makes the next round easier. Can't think too far beyond that yet
02/07/2018, 20:13 - Rob;: Attempting to quite myself there
02/07/2018, 20:13 - Rob;: This opinion dated very quickly
02/07/2018, 20:17 - David;: Belgium a shit
02/07/2018, 20:18 - David;: Who even does football now?
02/07/2018, 20:19 - Jack G;: Martinez is a fraud
02/07/2018, 20:20 - David;: Having a golden generation is a shit storm
02/07/2018, 20:21 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs almost preferable to have shit players
02/07/2018, 20:21 - Rob;: Incredibly risky to have anyone good at all
02/07/2018, 20:21 - Damian Rumble: Playing in the premier league is a shit storm
02/07/2018, 20:21 - David;: You never want that. You want to polish up a bronze or copper generation
02/07/2018, 20:22 - David;: England's manganese generation.
02/07/2018, 20:22 - Jack G;: These players are made of tungsten
02/07/2018, 20:22 - David;: Yeah, tungsten at best
02/07/2018, 20:23 - David;: Belgium's argon generation. Inert and incredibly unreactive.
02/07/2018, 20:25 - David;: Put 2 quid on belgium to win it - 15/1
02/07/2018, 20:25 - Damian Rumble: "huge shock as group of over-hyped egotistical man-children beaten by well drilled unit of team players"
02/07/2018, 20:26 - Paul Dickinson: Is japan football now?
02/07/2018, 20:26 - Phill: Belgium are like the EU. Fucking irrelevant.
02/07/2018, 20:28 - David;: Do you automatically get ranked up to top 8 in the world if you get to the world cup quarters?
02/07/2018, 20:28 - David;: Ah. Hebib
02/07/2018, 20:28 - Jack G;: Ah
02/07/2018, 20:29 - David;: What goal is that? A genre of goal i've never seen
02/07/2018, 20:29 - Sam;: I‚Äôm not buying that he meant that
02/07/2018, 20:29 - Jack G;: Accidental goal? Think it was intended as a cross
02/07/2018, 20:30 - David;: Or just re-inventing the very wide angled loopi g header technique
02/07/2018, 20:31 - Damian Rumble: Unbelievable
02/07/2018, 20:31 - Damian Rumble: Who let's fellaini score at the world cup
02/07/2018, 20:32 - David;: Moyes foresaw this

02/07/2018, 20:34 - David;: They are giving me an ¬£8 cash in. I'm drunk with power.
02/07/2018, 20:35 - David;: Fuck that, i'm riding out the wave.
02/07/2018, 20:36 - Jack G;: Japan obviously didn‚Äôt get the memo that 2-0 is the most dangerous scoreline
02/07/2018, 20:38 - David;: Yeah, maybe phrase doesn't translate. 'Ah so, as the Western man say, 2 zero big opportunity'
02/07/2018, 20:52 - Rob;: Ah fuck it
02/07/2018, 20:53 - Damian Rumble: Great goal though.
02/07/2018, 20:53 - Rob;: Great game

02/07/2018, 20:53 - Rob;: Doesn't really matter who goes out when, all the good teams will crunch down into one whatever happens
02/07/2018, 20:53 - Damian Rumble: Brazil Belgium Big
02/07/2018, 20:54 - Phill: Best world cup.

02/07/2018, 20:59 - Paul Dickinson: Brazil are shit. Will choke like last time
02/07/2018, 20:59 - Paul Dickinson: Not even a controversial statement
02/07/2018, 20:59 - David;: France croatia final then?
02/07/2018, 21:00 - Paul Dickinson: Belgium Croatia
02/07/2018, 21:00 - David;: Put a bet on that
02/07/2018, 21:00 - David;: Good odds probably
02/07/2018, 21:01 - Paul Dickinson: Sir Harry Kane tomorrow then
02/07/2018, 21:02 - David;: Are people overlooking uruguay?

02/07/2018, 21:05 - David;: Colombia match is too big, can't get close to it
02/07/2018, 21:06 - Jack G;: James Rodriguez probably no fully fit though
02/07/2018, 21:06 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm optimistic
02/07/2018, 21:09 - David;: Colombia to win on pens 9/1. Good insurance bet against butt hurt?
02/07/2018, 21:10 - Paul Dickinson: Blarry lane to miss a penno as well

02/07/2018, 21:24 - Phill: Becca and I have a theory that she has some form of Attention defecit disorder.
02/07/2018, 21:25 - Phill: Just constantly distracted by dick
02/07/2018, 21:28 - David;: Lol so a cock specific attention disorder?
02/07/2018, 21:29 - David;: Havent watched for a few days whats going on with all this villa shit?
02/07/2018, 21:30 - Phill: So the men moved to another villa with 6 new dints
02/07/2018, 21:30 - Phill: And the original dints stayed with 6 new guys
02/07/2018, 21:30 - Phill: Meghan broke up Wes and Laura, but then immediately sacked him off for a fresh dick within 24 hours

02/07/2018, 21:37 - Phill: There is banging but it's never televised.
02/07/2018, 21:37 - Phill: Just discussed.
02/07/2018, 21:38 - David;: You just see the inter-bang diplomatic efforts
02/07/2018, 21:46 - Sam;: A lot of one on one break out sessions to pursue a mutual path towards bang
02/07/2018, 21:49 - David;: Plus lots of whatties
02/07/2018, 21:50 - David;: Who are you rating sambo?
02/07/2018, 21:52 - David;: This is essentially a prisoners dilemma game
02/07/2018, 22:08 - Sam;: I‚Äôm hoping Adams newest dint would be filth based on the tattoos and muddy little face. I like Laura - like shagging a barbie. Joshs new bird is notchable
02/07/2018, 22:09 - David;: 'Muddy little face'
02/07/2018, 22:09 - Phill: Adams new dint looks like a tranny.
02/07/2018, 22:09 - Sam;: As I say, a muddy boat
02/07/2018, 22:10 - Phill: Laura is grotty. Sun peeled. Like one of those books that's been in a shop window for too long. Bleached.
02/07/2018, 22:11 - David;: High potential for skin cancer
02/07/2018, 22:13 - Phill: Love how everyone hides behind the "connection"

03/07/2018, 16:00 - David;: seems bad odds for 3+ corners each each half.
03/07/2018, 16:00 - David;: You can't buy a corner these days
03/07/2018, 16:01 - Rob;: I didn't put much on it
03/07/2018, 16:55 - Phill: Why didn't you lay the free bets for a guaranteed ¬£50?
03/07/2018, 16:58 - Rob;: You can't make that much at the odds they give you for England, and Betfair wouldn't let you use the free bet on both England and Colombia to progress
03/07/2018, 16:58 - Phill: >what is smarkets
03/07/2018, 16:59 - Phill: What were the odds on Colombia to win?

03/07/2018, 17:01 - Phill: This is on one ¬£30 free bet
03/07/2018, 17:01 - Phill: <Media omitted>
03/07/2018, 17:03 - Rob;: I mean I'm getting ¬£5 less if England win and ¬£18 if Colombia win. Wanted it to stack that way to mitigate disappoint
03/07/2018, 17:03 - Rob;: And wanted some fun long shot bets
03/07/2018, 17:04 - Phill: But to be fair, matched betting is dull as fuck
03/07/2018, 17:04 - Phill: Win. Win. Win. Win. Win.
03/07/2018, 17:04 - Phill: Adds nothing to the experience.
03/07/2018, 17:05 - Rob;: Yeah I don't care much for betting
03/07/2018, 17:06 - Rob;: Don't want to do it all the time

03/07/2018, 19:31 - Phill: Why is he playing ahead of rashford?
03/07/2018, 19:35 - Jack G;: Alli not playing well either
03/07/2018, 19:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Always good to have Radford off the b3nch
03/07/2018, 19:47 - Paul Dickinson: Dirty little Colombians
03/07/2018, 19:47 - Jack G;: Shithousing all first half
03/07/2018, 19:48 - Stefan;: Pure filth
03/07/2018, 19:48 - Paul Dickinson: Kind of people who would sell you electronics out the back of a van
03/07/2018, 19:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Saw someone describe this game this game as "supply vs demand "
03/07/2018, 20:15 - Rob;: Big pen
03/07/2018, 20:15 - Rob;: Please big pen
03/07/2018, 20:16 - Paul Dickinson: Bing bong big pen
03/07/2018, 20:16 - Paul Dickinson: Red cards when
03/07/2018, 20:19 - Rob;: Those balls
03/07/2018, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: So Columbia are cunts
03/07/2018, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Who knew
03/07/2018, 20:24 - Jack G;: Did the ref forget his red card?
03/07/2018, 20:25 - Rob;: Has to be a red soon
03/07/2018, 20:27 - Paul Dickinson: How many yellows have they got?
03/07/2018, 20:43 - Phill: My arse
03/07/2018, 20:54 - Sam;: My arse is gonna fall out

03/07/2018, 21:54 - Jack G;: My heart
03/07/2018, 21:54 - Rob;: I am broken
03/07/2018, 21:55 - Hamish Sinclair: I believe it's coming home
03/07/2018, 21:55 - Phill: Wrighty. Crying.
03/07/2018, 21:56 - Stefan;: A well deserved defeat for Colombia
03/07/2018, 21:56 - Phill: Something's a brewin' if we're winning shootouts
03/07/2018, 22:02 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
03/07/2018, 22:04 - Rob;: Never seen us do penalties. I can't
03/07/2018, 22:04 - Rob;: This feels unbelievable
03/07/2018, 22:38 - Sam;: First World Cup pens win ever
03/07/2018, 22:38 - Paul Dickinson: Pennos mate. Easy
03/07/2018, 23:21 - Rob;: Through on penalties!!!
03/07/2018, 23:22 - Rob;: England.
03/07/2018, 23:22 - Rob;: Penalties
03/07/2018, 23:26 - Paul Dickinson: Pennos
03/07/2018, 23:27 - Jack G;: Southgate redeemed for euro 96
03/07/2018, 23:28 - Paul Dickinson: Southy. Pennos. Simple. Metaphor.
03/07/2018, 23:28 - Jack G;: Men with pen
03/07/2018, 23:28 - Hamish Sinclair: üëç
03/07/2018, 23:30 - Rob;: Simple
04/07/2018, 01:17 - Sam;: I‚Äôve watched the highlights twice now
04/07/2018, 01:18 - Sam;: It‚Äôs still great
04/07/2018, 01:18 - Sam;: Third time lucky
04/07/2018, 11:28 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/07/2018, 13:03 - Damian Rumble: This weekend but m going to hippie/psytrance Festival and they've just announced that they are showing the England match. Who here thinks I should drop some acid before the game?
04/07/2018, 13:05 - Rob;: Why not
04/07/2018, 13:06 - Rob;: I'm at The Cure at British Summer Time in Hyde Park. Have no idea if they'll be showing it. Also think it'll clash with someone alright
04/07/2018, 14:19 - David;: So is football coming home?
04/07/2018, 14:21 - Rob;: It hasn't been more coming home for 22 years
04/07/2018, 14:21 - David;: Well I guess it was equally on the way home in 2002 and 2006
04/07/2018, 14:22 - David;: But it's in a better car this time
04/07/2018, 14:22 - Rob;: On a better road
04/07/2018, 14:23 - Rob;: It's the road that's got me dreaming
04/07/2018, 14:23 - Rob;: Sweden have to be dealt with. Just have to be.
04/07/2018, 14:23 - Jack G;: Big regrets if we can‚Äôt get past Sweden
04/07/2018, 14:26 - David;: Yeah, in 2002 football was trying to get home but home was up the blaen-y-cwm track after the cattle grid and it was in Crippos old car.
04/07/2018, 14:27 - Sam;: The weather conditions are better this time as well
04/07/2018, 14:27 - Damian Rumble: And crippo was driving
04/07/2018, 14:27 - / James Ball: Crippo's old car dangling off the bridge is a resounding memory
04/07/2018, 14:27 - Damian Rumble: ... off the bridge...
04/07/2018, 14:28 - David;: That was excellent. Another highlight was damo trying to drive his old car down in perilous blizzard conditions.
04/07/2018, 14:28 - David;: The farmer helped everyone else but the shittiest car was left to navigate down alone
04/07/2018, 14:31 - David;: Would not like to face Russia in the semis.
04/07/2018, 14:31 - / James Ball: Home crowd advantage
04/07/2018, 14:32 - / James Ball: Full of steroids
04/07/2018, 14:32 - David;: Yeah, and the home also happens to be a massively corrupt autocracy
04/07/2018, 14:33 - David;: Whose fans are famously racist and violent and who we have entered a bitter geopolitical struggle against.
04/07/2018, 14:33 - David;: There's just a lot that could go wrong there
04/07/2018, 14:33 - / James Ball: Details, details
04/07/2018, 14:33 - / James Ball: I do like the gazprom adverts on all the matches as well
04/07/2018, 14:34 - Rob;: Yeah would much rather play Croatia, a tough match but the knowns are known
04/07/2018, 14:34 - Rob;: Fewer unknown unknowns
04/07/2018, 14:34 - David;: Yeah and they showed against Denmark they can play a duffer.
04/07/2018, 14:34 - David;: Didn't look great in that match
04/07/2018, 14:35 - Sam;: A little duffer
04/07/2018, 14:38 - Damian Rumble: Get the crowds chatting "do you want your Novichok back?"
04/07/2018, 14:39 - Rob;: 'Crimea river' if they go out
04/07/2018, 14:40 - Sam;: Reviewing Uruguay Portugal. France Uruguay could be a cracker
04/07/2018, 14:47 - David;: I was reviewing Croatia's 98 tournament the other day. Mental, considering they'd only been a country for like 5 years. They beat Germany 3-0 in the quarters.
04/07/2018, 14:47 - David;: and then the Netherlands. Finished 3rd overall.
04/07/2018, 14:48 - Rob;: Davor Suker golden boot?
04/07/2018, 14:49 - David;: Believe so. Only lost 2-1 to eventual winners and hosts France in semis.
04/07/2018, 14:49 - David;: Quite a blinder to pull out of nowhere
04/07/2018, 19:01 - Stefan;: Big crisp shortage looming
04/07/2018, 19:02 - Stefan;: Hot weather is ruining potato crops apparently
04/07/2018, 21:03 - Rob;: Settling down for my 30th little watch of Ross Kemp
04/07/2018, 21:03 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/RossKemp/status/1014254265190305792?s=19

05/07/2018, 11:49 - David;: So master of none is actually a masterpiece.
05/07/2018, 11:49 - David;: Arnold
05/07/2018, 11:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Welcome to 2017
05/07/2018, 11:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Big arn
05/07/2018, 11:50 - David;: Just catching up on Netflix.
05/07/2018, 11:50 - David;: When he negotiates the sofa.
05/07/2018, 11:51 - Rob;: And the romance of it too. More than a comedy
05/07/2018, 11:51 - David;: Yeah it's working well as the perfect blend of comedy and story.
05/07/2018, 11:52 - Rob;: Great music too
05/07/2018, 11:52 - Rob;: Are you on series 2?
05/07/2018, 11:52 - David;: Yeah, with the different tune each episode. Watched the one which is all first dates last night.
05/07/2018, 11:52 - David;: Series 2 yeah.
05/07/2018, 11:53 - Rob;: Really comes into it's own in S2
05/07/2018, 11:53 - David;: End of series 1 as well - the mornings episode
05/07/2018, 11:53 - David;: Is ther egoing to be a 3rd series?
05/07/2018, 11:53 - David;: Also like the Italy episodes.
05/07/2018, 11:59 - Rob;: I would imagine so, unless #metoo swallows him up
05/07/2018, 11:59 - Rob;: I mean it probably won't, the allegations were basically 'i had a very weird date with him'
05/07/2018, 14:26 - Sam;: One of Russia Croatia Sweden or England will be in the World Cup final. Mental
05/07/2018, 14:53 - Rob;: Was listening to Motty on Desert Island discs earlier
05/07/2018, 14:53 - Rob;: Worth a listen. He knows what football is
05/07/2018, 15:00 - David;: Worried by the complacency creeping in now.
05/07/2018, 15:00 - David;: Everyone seems to have forgotten we actually played shite for most of that game
05/07/2018, 15:01 - Jack G;: But Dave, it‚Äôs coming home
05/07/2018, 15:05 - Sam;: Colombia weren‚Äôt interested in playing football just fouling and whinging to the ref. They can go fuck themselves. Their coach even bathed into sterling as he walked off at half time and for harry Kane‚Äôs penalty their player was scuffing up the penalty spot. Pricks. But for a freak long shot and last second goal we were in control and looking comfortable
05/07/2018, 15:06 - Jack G;: Yeah, Sweden are far less likely to use shithousery
05/07/2018, 15:08 - Rob;: Or at least less good at it
05/07/2018, 15:08 - Damian Rumble: Sweden also have players who are far less likely to score. Basically they only defend.
05/07/2018, 15:08 - Sam;: Sweden are actually really shit. Very lucky against Switzerland. If we score first we‚Äôll win
05/07/2018, 15:09 - Damian Rumble: Just as long as we don't get caught on the counter we should be ok. Can even back ourselves for 0-0 pens... Which should disuade them from parking the bus quite so much
05/07/2018, 15:09 - Jack G;: Berg has the worst shot conversion rate in the tournament
05/07/2018, 15:13 - David;: Disagree. We went into our shell and probed unable to create any real chances from open play or on the counter. Should have been able to get the second as they pushed forward amd left spaces. Negative sub bringing Dier on that invited them on. Then we imploded and were psychologically broken in extra time, barely able to string 2 passes together.
05/07/2018, 15:13 - David;: *proved
05/07/2018, 15:14 - Hamish Sinclair: The drop off from Henderson to dier is worrying
05/07/2018, 15:14 - David;: We've only actually scored 1 intentional goal not from a set piece all tournament
05/07/2018, 15:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Id  disagree we only fell apart in first half of ET, we were on top in the seconds half
05/07/2018, 15:14 - David;: (Lingard)
05/07/2018, 15:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Took us 15minutes to get over conceding last minute goal
05/07/2018, 15:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Which is understandable, positive are that we didn't concede in those 15minutes and we came through it and pushed back in the last 15
05/07/2018, 15:16 - Hamish Sinclair: I don't think the open play/set piece thing matters too much. We attack a lot and therefore get alot of attacking set pieces
05/07/2018, 15:17 - Rob;: Yeah, and teams are using fouls against us because they're afraid of our set pieces, which is winning up penalties
05/07/2018, 15:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh, also fear of set pieces is a good thing as it draws penalties and also opposition players won't want to get to tight to sterlimg/lingaard etc as they know a foul could lead to a goal
05/07/2018, 19:05 - Damian Rumble: @447969894197  what were your total winnings from the England game in the end?
05/07/2018, 19:20 - Rob;: The minimum - ¬£26 profit, but more than I'd expected for some reason
06/07/2018, 08:20 - Phill: So close to shitting myself on the train this morning
06/07/2018, 09:04 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
06/07/2018, 10:16 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
06/07/2018, 10:20 - Sam;: Would have been more comfortable with a locked door analogy rather than already being on the inside of a locked box. Savage
06/07/2018, 10:23 - / James Ball: I'm staying in a Johannesburg penthouse
06/07/2018, 10:23 - / James Ball: The owner has lots of strange Jewish and Nazi books
06/07/2018, 10:24 - Sam;: His house is stuffed with blood diamonds. Probably blood and diamonds
06/07/2018, 10:26 - / James Ball: There is a piece of art that just has "I shit diamonds" on it
06/07/2018, 10:26 - / James Ball: He's a Nigerian businessman

06/07/2018, 12:58 - Phill: Explosive shitting today
06/07/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: What's prompted it?
06/07/2018, 12:59 - Phill: Not sure
06/07/2018, 12:59 - Phill: Got a lot of reduced food from Tesco last night
06/07/2018, 13:00 - Phill: Also this weather has meant I basically have been boozing every night for the past month
06/07/2018, 13:00 - Phill: Bought so much wine recently that the guys at majestic wine gave me a card whereby I can buy individual bottles for the 'buy 6' price
06/07/2018, 13:01 - Rob;: It is very hard not to booze. Last night I was looking forward to a night off, went for a walk, bumped into Amy and ended up in the pub
06/07/2018, 13:03 - Phill: Yeah it's savage. Coupled with the world cup too. I'm not joking when I say I'm probably consuming close to 70 units a week. Maybe more. With Wales two come and a two week stint in France I am genuinely fearful for my health.
06/07/2018, 13:05 - Sam;: Can‚Äôt stop drinking though. It‚Äôs a must
06/07/2018, 13:06 - Rob;: Yeah. There's no chance of treating yourself well before Wales
06/07/2018, 13:06 - Phill: I'm not boozing for the 5 or 6 days before Wales
06/07/2018, 13:06 - Phill: Can't handle it. Feel grotty.
06/07/2018, 13:08 - Phill: Piss like tango, shit like gravy
06/07/2018, 13:12 - Phill: The shitting may also be from a rather yeasty batch of beer last night
06/07/2018, 13:12 - Phill: A little brewery in my guts
06/07/2018, 13:27 - David;: Gin really slips down though doesn't it. Takes the edge off
06/07/2018, 14:32 - Sam;: No Cavani for Uruguay

06/07/2018, 20:03 - Jack G;: Yeah that‚Äôs pointless
06/07/2018, 20:05 - Sam;: What‚Äôs the corners situation?
06/07/2018, 20:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Mugs game
06/07/2018, 20:14 - Jack G;: Pen?
06/07/2018, 20:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Defo
06/07/2018, 20:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Although contact might be after ball has gone out?
06/07/2018, 20:15 - Jack G;: Why would the ref not bother to take 5 seconds to watch the video though?
06/07/2018, 20:15 - Jack G;: May as well
06/07/2018, 20:34 - Rob;: Back on!
06/07/2018, 20:35 - Sam;: This is pod racing
06/07/2018, 20:44 - Sam;: Will he regret taking lukaku off?
06/07/2018, 20:45 - Rob;: I hope so, just so we get maximum football

06/07/2018, 20:49 - Rob;: The boy who cried dive
06/07/2018, 20:57 - Rob;: Fine margins in that. The own goal, penalties Brazil might have got on another night and a brilliant late save.
06/07/2018, 20:58 - Sam;: Brazil missed some unbelievable chances as well. Silva in the first 10 mins
06/07/2018, 20:58 - Jack G;: ‚ÄúI never lost a game in tactics‚Äù - Martinez
06/07/2018, 20:59 - Rob;: Yeah, they had three great chances in the first 10
06/07/2018, 20:59 - Rob;: But Belgium are good. Solid everywhere

07/07/2018, 11:13 - David;: Take some more laxative - the shitting will keep you focused and alert
07/07/2018, 11:14 - David;: It will be pretty ironic if after all this we get beaten by a team playing a classic 4-4-2.
07/07/2018, 12:39 - Rob;: I can hear Three Lions coming from two windows in separate houses
07/07/2018, 14:17 - David;: Who's driving to Wales? Apparently Hamish might not be able to drive up now.
07/07/2018, 14:49 - Rob;: Damo is taking Stefan and I

07/07/2018, 14:50 - Hamish Sinclair: And am working every day
07/07/2018, 14:50 - Sam;: Is it just a new tyre?
07/07/2018, 14:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
07/07/2018, 14:51 - Hamish Sinclair: It Should be finr
07/07/2018, 14:51 - Sam;: Paul and phil, can you confirm what you‚Äôre doing?

07/07/2018, 15:38 - Damian Rumble: That crowd...
07/07/2018, 15:38 - / James Ball: A lot of "j√§vlar fan!" being said over here, it's amusing.

07/07/2018, 15:39 - Sam;: Brilliant. Shove that up your hyygge
07/07/2018, 15:40 - / James Ball: They have basically abandoned all hope
07/07/2018, 15:44 - Rob;: That would have been VAR'd. Never mind
07/07/2018, 15:46 - Rob;: Value of Sterling plummeting
07/07/2018, 15:47 - Sam;: His indecisiveness is infuriating
07/07/2018, 15:47 - Rob;: Goalkeeper did perhaps take his leg as he shaped to shoot
07/07/2018, 15:47 - Rob;: But why take a second touch?
07/07/2018, 15:47 - / James Ball: Still, he just had two attempts on goal
07/07/2018, 15:48 - / James Ball: Should have been ready. Not hanging about hope that the yellow shirts get bored
07/07/2018, 15:48 - Sam;: Well at least he was offside on the first one but he‚Äôs got to square the second one to Kane
07/07/2018, 15:49 - Sam;: Should still finish the first one
07/07/2018, 15:50 - Rob;: Hendo has been immense this cup
07/07/2018, 16:03 - Jack G;: Big dickford

07/07/2018, 19:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Shall we cancel wales and go to Moscow?
07/07/2018, 19:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Lads on tour
07/07/2018, 19:19 - Rob;: We haven't spent any money on Wales yet...
07/07/2018, 19:46 - Damian Rumble: Ummmm... Yes
07/07/2018, 20:40 - David;: I had another dream about froust shopping for wales in a massive supermarket last night. The shittiest recurring anxiety dream ever.
07/07/2018, 20:40 - Paul Dickinson: Pick up anything good?
07/07/2018, 20:41 - David;: Everyone else had checked out but i couldn't find the wine because the shop was so big - it was like a huge lunk food labaryinth

07/07/2018, 21:12 - Damian Rumble: Who would you rather play?
07/07/2018, 21:13 - Jack G;: Croatia purely because I‚Äôd rather avoid facing Russia on home turf. Although we can beat either
07/07/2018, 21:13 - Paul Dickinson: This hubristic confidence
07/07/2018, 21:13 - Jack G;: We‚Äôre in the semi final...

07/07/2018, 21:17 - David;: Winner of france vs belgium
07/07/2018, 21:18 - David;: I'd rather play belgium they have the same inexperience and butt hurt potential
07/07/2018, 21:23 - David;: Is this the first time anyone has scored in extra time at this world cup? Think all others have gone to pens
07/07/2018, 21:24 - Damian Rumble: I'd rather play France. They chock horribly at the euros. They will chock again.

07/07/2018, 21:34 - Paul Dickinson: Russia all the way
07/07/2018, 21:36 - Paul Dickinson: They‚Äôre all nice and tired though

08/07/2018, 21:10 - Phill: Joining the party late. Honk.
08/07/2018, 21:10 - Phill: I'm driving up Friday morning with Dickinson, picking him up from chippy some point on Thursday
08/07/2018, 21:11 - Sam;: Can I join you guys? I‚Äôll get myself to chippy on Friday morning
08/07/2018, 21:14 - Paul Dickinson: He‚Äôs picking me up Thursday not Friday
08/07/2018, 21:14 - Phill: Going from here
08/07/2018, 21:14 - Phill: But if you get yourself to chippy Thursday night you can
08/07/2018, 21:16 - Sam;: Ok, cool what time Thursday?
08/07/2018, 21:17 - Rob;: How are Dave and Hamish doing it if Hamish can't get the Aubergine fixed?
08/07/2018, 21:19 - Phill: Dunno yet will let you know
08/07/2018, 21:19 - Phill: I presume Dave could come with me and the Londoners and Hamish could go with damo?
08/07/2018, 21:20 - Sam;: That would work right?
08/07/2018, 21:23 - Rob;: It's probably best if Jack collects us all individually and does shuttle runs
08/07/2018, 21:25 - Paul Dickinson: That would make the most sense
08/07/2018, 21:26 - Phill: Could just walk, seems to be what everyone wants to do anyway. Not far.
08/07/2018, 21:27 - Phill: Make it in time for the final
08/07/2018, 21:28 - Phill: Spend the 5 days walking to the pub from chippy, then just start heading straight back to chippy
08/07/2018, 21:28 - Phill: After the game
08/07/2018, 21:28 - Phill: Chanting "we're coming home, were coming, we are coming home" all the way
08/07/2018, 21:29 - Rob;: Jack would be left with one of those fox-chicken-grain situations where he has to work out if he can leave Sam in Wales with the lager while he goes to fetch Damian, only to have left Paul with the marching powder in Chippy
08/07/2018, 22:47 - Hamish Sinclair: I think I'm going to be fine
08/07/2018, 23:39 - David;: üëç
08/07/2018, 23:39 - David;: Might have to quickly tax, insure and jump start the jazz if not.
08/07/2018, 23:40 - David;: Old reliable
08/07/2018, 23:52 - David;: Presume everyone saw the big match on Saturday? Obviously talking about liverpool's 7-0 pre-season win over Chester.
08/07/2018, 23:52 - David;: Keita and fabinho looking sharp on debut
08/07/2018, 23:53 - Paul Dickinson: >Chester
08/07/2018, 23:54 - David;: One of the biggest teams in the national league north
08/07/2018, 23:54 - Paul Dickinson: Ready for the champions league off the back of that?
09/07/2018, 09:55 - Phill: Apparently Harry Maguire's nickname at Leicester is 'SLABHEAD'
09/07/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: Yeah, Jamie Vardy's idea application
09/07/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: *apparently

09/07/2018, 14:26 - David;: Been revisiting 'tout ets possible' - a b side on the 98 single release of Three Lions.
09/07/2018, 14:26 - David;: A little known classic
09/07/2018, 14:29 - Phill: Lol, after the match at my mum's we were all steaming and my brother got his subs out the garage into the garden and we were blaring all the hits
09/07/2018, 14:29 - Phill: Three lions, world in motion, vindaloo, waving flag
09/07/2018, 14:32 - Rob;: I found it really hard to sleep last night because Three Lions is always drifting out of a window somewhere. I'm not even sick of it, it just makes me too excited to sleep
09/07/2018, 14:33 - David;: It's actually such a tune
09/07/2018, 14:33 - David;: I maintain the 98 version is better for this tourny because of the Southgate link
09/07/2018, 14:34 - Rob;: True.
09/07/2018, 14:34 - Rob;: I just like to remember 96. The start of everything for us
09/07/2018, 14:35 - Phill: "big plans for final day"
09/07/2018, 14:35 - Phill: "THREE LINES UP YER NOOOOSE"
09/07/2018, 14:37 - David;: "Three Lines up yer' Schneeb, 2CB still gleaming"
09/07/2018, 14:39 - Phill: It could have been all bongs in the street, brain blooted alreet, it was nearly so sweet, but all he wanted: THREE LINES UP MY NOSE. DICKINSON STILL SCREAMING.
09/07/2018, 15:06 - Jack G;: Boris gone then

09/07/2018, 15:07 - Rob;: Just trying to get May sacked surely?
09/07/2018, 15:09 - Damian Rumble: This is a massive vote of no confidence in the pm. Surely a leadership challenge must follow...
09/07/2018, 15:09 - Jack G;: Tories have fucked this up so badly
09/07/2018, 15:10 - Jack G;: Surely we‚Äôre going to have to request to extend the negotiations with the EU
09/07/2018, 15:13 - Damian Rumble: Tbh May has been kicking this can down the road for months. Idiotic to not deal with it until the 11th hour. #strongandstable
09/07/2018, 15:15 - Jack G;: If she survives then she‚Äôll push for BINO. If not then another election and surely delay Brexit or cancel all together?
09/07/2018, 15:16 - Phill: Fuck that. Full steam ahead. Give me the cliff edge.
09/07/2018, 15:16 - Phill: Lol jack. "Brexit? Just cancel it"
09/07/2018, 15:17 - Damian Rumble: Yeahhhhh... We could see Davis Vs may. Hard Vs soft brexit.

09/07/2018, 15:17 - Phill: DYOR
09/07/2018, 15:17 - Rob;: GOAT
09/07/2018, 15:18 - Jack G;: Not one brexiteer has come up feasible alternative. They just like making noise. It‚Äôs just a fucking doctrine to them
09/07/2018, 15:18 - Damian Rumble: Brexit in name only
09/07/2018, 15:18 - Paul Dickinson: >BINO
09/07/2018, 15:19 - Damian Rumble: I think David Davis genuinely wants the cliff edge.

09/07/2018, 15:26 - Jack G;: Can‚Äôt handle all this breaking news
09/07/2018, 15:27 - Paul Dickinson: Wales will be intense planning fantasy football
09/07/2018, 15:28 - Paul Dickinson: Ontop of World Cup
09/07/2018, 15:28 - Paul Dickinson: Football within football
09/07/2018, 15:28 - Paul Dickinson: Fetus in fetus
09/07/2018, 15:28 - David;: Yeah yeah, and the transfer rumour mill getting going. Intravenous football.
09/07/2018, 15:30 - Sam;: Good to have no signal for it as well.
09/07/2018, 15:30 - David;: Nah mate, B-y-C is all over the 4g now.
09/07/2018, 15:31 - Phill: Why don't we just take a projector and stream the final in the barn?
09/07/2018, 15:31 - David;: won't have internet.
09/07/2018, 15:31 - Phill: Umm hello? 4g?
09/07/2018, 15:31 - David;: only phone signal. Will not be tethering first final since 66
09/07/2018, 15:32 - Sam;: But muh 4g dave
09/07/2018, 15:33 - Sam;: Nah, we need to fuck in Dolgellau then make a quick retreat to the keep
09/07/2018, 15:33 - Sam;: Blaen-y-keep
09/07/2018, 15:33 - Sam;: Set a fire in our flesh
09/07/2018, 15:35 - Paul Dickinson: >fuck in dolgellau
09/07/2018, 15:35 - David;: Yeah thanks but I will not be relying on teathering to watch the world cup final. Have fun up in ByC sorting that out.
09/07/2018, 15:36 - Paul Dickinson: One earpiece and a wind up radio? Could do it like that
09/07/2018, 15:36 - Sam;: Lol. *fuck up
09/07/2018, 15:36 - Damian Rumble: No
09/07/2018, 15:37 - Sam;: Jack perched on the roof with a receiver sticking out off arse
09/07/2018, 15:38 - David;: 'let's watch it with no atmosphere on a precarious phone signal rather than a nearby pub where's it's being shown on terrestrial TV'
09/07/2018, 15:38 - Paul Dickinson: Pub will be empty. Wales innit
09/07/2018, 15:39 - Sam;: Invaders
09/07/2018, 15:39 - Phill: "let's watch it in a Welsh pub, with Sam fired up on lager, and all leave with a joint enterprise conviction for assault"
09/07/2018, 15:39 - Sam;: On tour in enemy territory
09/07/2018, 15:39 - David;: 'I've got GPRS through a local hotspot, what are you worrying about?'
09/07/2018, 15:39 - Paul Dickinson: Assuming we make the final
09/07/2018, 15:40 - David;: 'as long as the final stream doesn't exceed my 2mb data cap'
09/07/2018, 15:40 - Sam;: We‚Äôre going to Smash Croatia. They fear us. Old slabhead
09/07/2018, 15:41 - Damian Rumble: We might want to enquire about booking a table at what ever pub we choose. Imagine the butt hurt if we have watch the whole thing from the window outside...
09/07/2018, 15:41 - Sam;: Yeah true
09/07/2018, 15:41 - Damian Rumble: (if we make the final)
09/07/2018, 15:42 - David;: We've already discussed this. If England make final we go to Barmouth. That's essentially a suburb of Birmingham anyway no one will give a shit
09/07/2018, 15:42 - David;: and there are multiple pubs. Play a bit of heads and volleys on the beach first to warm up.
09/07/2018, 15:42 - David;: classic final day
09/07/2018, 15:43 - Phill: But I want to watch the Wimbledon men's final.
09/07/2018, 15:43 - David;: You can GPRS that on the ridge.
09/07/2018, 15:43 - Paul Dickinson: Barmouth or old doggers?
09/07/2018, 15:44 - Damian Rumble: Need to scout Barmouth pubs
09/07/2018, 15:49 - Paul Dickinson: The royal. We can go fighting in there
09/07/2018, 15:53 - Paul Dickinson: Barmouth might be hideously busy that‚Äôs the only thing
09/07/2018, 15:53 - Paul Dickinson: No one expects dolgellau but everyone expects barmouth
09/07/2018, 15:54 - Sam;: It‚Äôs easier to negotiate as well I guess
09/07/2018, 15:56 - Paul Dickinson: Looks to be 4 pubs in barmouth I think
09/07/2018, 15:57 - Paul Dickinson: The last inn, tal-y-don, the royal, barmouth bar and grill
09/07/2018, 15:58 - David;: The last inn
09/07/2018, 15:58 - David;: The last homely house
09/07/2018, 15:58 - David;: The pub at the end of the universe.
09/07/2018, 16:03 - Sam;: That hotel in Dolgellau that someone mentioned looked like quite decent place to go anyway. Plus the factor of not being in the ‚Äòlocal boozer‚Äô category
09/07/2018, 16:08 - David;: I like that pub, have watched footy there before.
09/07/2018, 16:08 - David;: There's huge exaggeration of the welsh issue going on, if we're not loutish cunts about it no one will care.
09/07/2018, 16:09 - David;: also then no one has to drive so all can piss along equally.
09/07/2018, 16:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Has to be barmouth
09/07/2018, 16:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Get in a fight with some brummy cunt who looks like Jamie vardy
09/07/2018, 16:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Walk to barmouth with cans
09/07/2018, 16:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Taxi home
09/07/2018, 16:14 - David;: Got potential. Questing over the hills to get there.
09/07/2018, 16:16 - Sam;: Fuck questing. Turning up drenched in sweat, completely knackered..
09/07/2018, 16:16 - Paul Dickinson: Stinking
09/07/2018, 16:16 - Paul Dickinson: Completely rancid
09/07/2018, 16:17 - Sam;: Thirsting. Football a distant after thought. Rehydration salts all we care about
09/07/2018, 16:18 - Paul Dickinson: Dripping duck butter from the gusset
09/07/2018, 16:22 - Phill: Dave, meet Sam.
09/07/2018, 16:24 - Sam;: Phil being the guy that provoked a welsh guy to stay, ‚Äú..go ahead, you won‚Äôt get out of here alive‚Äù when we visited holly
09/07/2018, 16:25 - Phill: In the past. Did my time.
09/07/2018, 16:25 - Paul Dickinson: Poppity ping. Board smoothio. English is a dying language. Brenton is a living language, welsh is a living language
09/07/2018, 16:33 - Phill: >Brenton
09/07/2018, 16:34 - Paul Dickinson: *bretton
09/07/2018, 16:34 - Paul Dickinson: Very dead language
09/07/2018, 16:34 - Phill: The weather feels so close today
09/07/2018, 16:34 - Phill: Oppressive. Constantly attacking my comfort.
09/07/2018, 16:35 - Phill: My hypothalamus is done. Overworked underpaid.
09/07/2018, 16:37 - Paul Dickinson: Pissing tango shitting gravy
09/07/2018, 16:45 - Phill: Back to pissing water and shitting shit now so all good there
09/07/2018, 16:48 - Paul Dickinson: Pissing shit and shitting water
09/07/2018, 16:49 - Phill: The dream.
09/07/2018, 16:49 - Phill: Eating shit, shitting food.
09/07/2018, 16:52 - Paul Dickinson: What happens with the food?
09/07/2018, 16:52 - Paul Dickinson: And do you farm shit for consumption?
09/07/2018, 16:53 - Phill: It's poison to you
09/07/2018, 16:53 - Phill: But everyone else can gump it
09/07/2018, 16:53 - Phill: Like the goose that lays the golden egg
09/07/2018, 16:53 - Phill: You're constantly on the run
09/07/2018, 16:54 - Paul Dickinson: So you‚Äôre just gobbling up shit wherever you can get it
09/07/2018, 16:54 - Paul Dickinson: Much harder than you‚Äôd think
09/07/2018, 16:54 - Phill: Because there are liberals that want to catch you and clone you to simultaneously end animal suffering and the need for sewerage and just pipe shit into you to feed to masses.
09/07/2018, 16:55 - Rob;: A big taxi between us all will cost barely anything
09/07/2018, 16:55 - Paul Dickinson: Need a diagram of the pipe system forcing shit in
09/07/2018, 16:55 - Paul Dickinson: And food coming out
09/07/2018, 16:55 - Phill: Just chained to the end of the main sewerage system mouth clamped open
09/07/2018, 16:55 - Hamish Sinclair: What provoked this?
09/07/2018, 16:55 - Paul Dickinson: Are you positioned like a hog
09/07/2018, 16:56 - Phill: Yeah, well you and your shit gobbling clones
09/07/2018, 16:56 - Phill: All in a unit like a battery
09/07/2018, 16:56 - Phill: Just getting force fed shit and laying little piles of food
09/07/2018, 16:57 - Paul Dickinson: Do you shit out the food that was previously eaten
09/07/2018, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Had a curry over the weekend that was identical in as it was out
09/07/2018, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Net gain 0
09/07/2018, 16:58 - Phill: Yeah, your connected, orally, to the main trunk sewers, so people go about their lives turning food into shit, which you then process again into food
09/07/2018, 16:58 - Phill: You're*
09/07/2018, 16:58 - Stefan;: This could solve the global environmental crisis at a stroke
09/07/2018, 16:59 - Stefan;: We'd never have to farm anything again
09/07/2018, 16:59 - Phill: Exactly why the liberals are after you.
09/07/2018, 16:59 - Phill: But you must hide.
09/07/2018, 16:59 - Stefan;: I'll put it forward as a policy motion at the green party conference
09/07/2018, 17:00 - Paul Dickinson: >main trunk sewers
09/07/2018, 17:04 - Sam;: Any tyre updates Hamish?
09/07/2018, 17:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Two new tyres tomorrow
09/07/2018, 17:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Sheets back on the menu
09/07/2018, 17:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Wheat
09/07/2018, 17:08 - Sam;: That‚Äôs wheelie good news
09/07/2018, 17:08 - Sam;: Sorry, tyrey good news
09/07/2018, 17:43 - Rob;: Would there still be interest in picking a up a barrel of beer?
09/07/2018, 17:43 - Rob;: Have asked this place if they do them
09/07/2018, 17:43 - Rob;: http://www.caderales.com/
09/07/2018, 17:43 - Rob;: Or is it too much faff when we can have lager at World Cup prices?
09/07/2018, 17:46 - Paul Dickinson: Barrel of carling, barrel of carlsberg and a barrel of piss - should do that
09/07/2018, 17:47 - Paul Dickinson: But yeah would be down for a barrel of that
09/07/2018, 17:47 - Rob;: We'll make a barrel of piss soon enough
09/07/2018, 17:53 - Sam;: I won‚Äôt be going anywhere near ale. Especially with World Cup deals going
09/07/2018, 17:56 - Paul Dickinson: But they‚Äôve run out of fizz for the lager I thought
09/07/2018, 17:57 - Rob;: It hasn't seemed to have caused huge shortages yet
09/07/2018, 17:57 - Jack G;: Fake news
09/07/2018, 17:57 - Rob;: Only things like Heineken have run dry on tap for a short period
09/07/2018, 17:59 - Phill: CO2 is back on the menu boys
09/07/2018, 18:00 - Paul Dickinson: Just huff CO2 all holiday
09/07/2018, 18:00 - Paul Dickinson: In celebration
09/07/2018, 18:00 - Rob;: Our CO2 emissions are huge anyway
09/07/2018, 18:00 - Rob;: Sam's are off the chart
09/07/2018, 18:02 - Paul Dickinson: The gas man

09/07/2018, 18:03 - Rob;: 'Horn blast'
09/07/2018, 18:59 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
09/07/2018, 19:00 - Damian Rumble: I'm really looking forward to watching the C4 news this evening
09/07/2018, 19:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Anyone watched the second season of flowers?
09/07/2018, 20:05 - Phill: Not yet
09/07/2018, 20:06 - Phill: Becca watched it when she was I'll and said it was forcefully more abstract than season 1
09/07/2018, 20:06 - Phill: Not as good as 1
09/07/2018, 20:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Very intense
09/07/2018, 20:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Less funny but wouldn't say necessarily worse
09/07/2018, 20:44 - Phill: Was saying earlier, when three lions was on in the car, that I think I'll cry if we win the world cup
09/07/2018, 20:45 - Paul Dickinson: Is it that big of an event?
09/07/2018, 20:46 - Phill: I'd say it's up there. With wedding and birth of child.
09/07/2018, 20:47 - Phill: Your nation. The patriotism. The redemption of Gareth. The national pride.
09/07/2018, 20:48 - Phill: Will probably shed a tear if we make it past Croatia.
09/07/2018, 20:48 - Phill: The memes Paul. The memes.
09/07/2018, 20:52 - Sam;: The right to be a cunt globally for four years.
09/07/2018, 20:53 - Phill: 2 world wars, 2 world cups
09/07/2018, 20:59 - Paul Dickinson: We should just stay in and refresh the bbc live text update page. What are other nice shit ways we could ruin the final for ourselves?
09/07/2018, 21:00 - Damian Rumble: Watch the Wimbledon final instead?
09/07/2018, 22:17 - Phill: Damo you can't celebrate if we win just because EU FC didn't qualify
09/07/2018, 22:33 - Damian Rumble: I have literally have no idea about what you're on about
09/07/2018, 22:46 - Rob;: Would Europe beat south America at a continental cup?
09/07/2018, 22:46 - Rob;: I mean it clearly would
09/07/2018, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: That would be a cool competition.
09/07/2018, 23:34 - David;: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-cup/2018/07/09/referee-has-sent-three-england-players-will-officiate-world/
09/07/2018, 23:35 - David;: > Cuneyt Cakir
09/07/2018, 23:35 - David;: What a Cuneyt
10/07/2018, 07:35 - Rob;: So he's only done it to one player actually in an England shirt at the time
10/07/2018, 07:36 - Rob;: Is three from one nationality particularly high when you ref internationals and the champions league?
10/07/2018, 07:50 - Phill: Cakir'd my pants
10/07/2018, 09:14 - Phill: Stefan just confirming you got the ket
10/07/2018, 09:15 - Phill: Picking the weed up tomorrow
10/07/2018, 09:15 - Phill: Did we want wine in the end?
10/07/2018, 09:32 - Stefan;: Yep got it
10/07/2018, 09:42 - Phill: <Media omitted>
10/07/2018, 14:55 - David;: <Media omitted>
10/07/2018, 15:06 - David;: Annual reminder to everyone to bring bedsheets etc. for Wales
10/07/2018, 15:06 - Rob;: Tell Judith I will
10/07/2018, 15:07 - David;: She'll really appreciate that.
10/07/2018, 16:53 - Phill: Ronaldo. Gone.
10/07/2018, 16:55 - David;: Stupid money for a 34 year old. Madrid saw Juve coming.
10/07/2018, 16:55 - Phill: Yeah probably get 2 seasons max out of him, although Italy is slow so..
10/07/2018, 16:58 - Jack G;: Ronaldo is a freak though, could pull a giggs
10/07/2018, 17:01 - David;: Even though his scoring rate is still crazy he's already become less influential all round
10/07/2018, 17:02 - David;: More of a poacher now with the odd unfathomable bloot
10/07/2018, 17:10 - Rob;: I don't think his age is particularly showing in his game yet
10/07/2018, 17:11 - Rob;: His pace will be frightening in Italy while it lasts
10/07/2018, 17:12 - David;: Heat maps show he drops deep a lot less and is playing as more of a classic number 9
10/07/2018, 17:13 - Rob;: I think that's been tactical really, his ability is so decisive you want him near the goal
10/07/2018, 17:13 - Rob;: The same way Messi was moved forward as he got better
10/07/2018, 17:15 - Rob;: I'm not saying he hasn't aged ability wise, just that it's been a lot slower than other great players, so it's very hard to say when he will fall away
10/07/2018, 17:15 - David;: Yeah but this is only last 1/2 seasons. I think it reflects that he can't run all over tye putch any more so more valuable to focus his running closer to goals
10/07/2018, 17:16 - David;: *pitch
10/07/2018, 17:22 - Rob;: Sure. I just don't think he'll conk out like second season Ibrahimovic and the money is just a reflection of the mental state of the market
10/07/2018, 17:22 - Paul Dickinson: Would rather have Ronaldo now than Messi 5 years ago
10/07/2018, 17:22 - Phill: Who's Messi?
10/07/2018, 17:23 - Rob;: you'd take 3 maybe 4 years of Ronaldo over more than a decade of Messi?
10/07/2018, 17:23 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah. Messi very overrated
10/07/2018, 17:23 - Rob;: Statisticly almost identical
10/07/2018, 17:24 - Paul Dickinson: Ronaldo can do it at stoke
10/07/2018, 17:24 - Paul Dickinson: Proven
10/07/2018, 17:27 - Rob;: Messi must be craving the chance to prove himself there. Willing to drop down to the Championship to do so
10/07/2018, 17:29 - Phill: Would rather have 10 minutes of Jordan Henderson than both Messi and Ronald for their whole careers. It's just not even a debate.
10/07/2018, 17:30 - Rob;: A fortnight with Sully Muntari over all of Pele at his best
10/07/2018, 17:31 - Phill: A boxing day of Amir Zaki over Dennis Bergkamp at his peak
10/07/2018, 17:32 - Phill: Lol, just reread robs
10/07/2018, 17:34 - David;: 2 hours with Titus Bramble over a perrenial Eusebio
10/07/2018, 17:34 - Phill: A fortnight WITH Sully Muntari
10/07/2018, 17:34 - Phill: Prepare your anus
10/07/2018, 17:36 - Phill: 45 minutes of Muscat over Matt Le Tissier in his pomp.
10/07/2018, 17:39 - Paul Dickinson: Serves yer rite fer muscat
10/07/2018, 17:40 - Phill: Go av a bath Danny. Sick o lookin at ye.
10/07/2018, 17:40 - Phill: There's a good lad.
10/07/2018, 17:41 - David;: 'Go an do everthing ya dun wanna do - take yer missus out, shag er in back of the car'
10/07/2018, 17:42 - Phill: YOU GOT TO FUCKIN DIE FOR THREE POINTS
10/07/2018, 17:58 - Paul Dickinson: Have to get a Ronaldo shirt
10/07/2018, 18:27 - Paul Dickinson: https://youtu.be/kQtWVcFpvHg
10/07/2018, 18:27 - David;: This the only time since 66 we've played anyone but Germany beyond the quarter finals of a major tournament - correct?
10/07/2018, 18:28 - David;: I.e. in all other tournaments we've either not made it beyond quarters or played Germany when we got there
10/07/2018, 18:31 - Jack G;: Well we‚Äôve only been in one semi since 1966 (other than tomorrow)?
10/07/2018, 18:32 - David;: 2 - 1990 and 96
10/07/2018, 18:32 - Jack G;: Ah yeah was thinking World Cup only
10/07/2018, 18:32 - David;: Both peno losses to Ger
10/07/2018, 18:32 - Phill: Euros count because Germany
10/07/2018, 18:32 - Paul Dickinson: Pennos
10/07/2018, 18:32 - David;: Well, read again. I quite clearly stated 'major tournaments'
10/07/2018, 18:33 - Paul Dickinson: Fackin pennos
10/07/2018, 18:33 - David;: 'No, I remember bruce lee fighting chuck lee in WAY of tye dragon'
10/07/2018, 20:08 - Rob;: Dat Titi
10/07/2018, 20:09 - Rob;: Umwatti
10/07/2018, 20:11 - Damian Rumble: All the big guns are out for this semi final. Macron. The king of Belgium. Mick Jagger
10/07/2018, 20:14 - Rob;: Love that fifa invited the Thai boys rescued from the cave to the world cup final
10/07/2018, 20:14 - Rob;: A long haul flight to Moscow, that's exactly what the doctor ordered
10/07/2018, 20:16 - Rob;: Just had the most traumatic of their lives
10/07/2018, 20:17 - Rob;: A man died saving them. They've had to master skills no child has ever been asked to learn. Get them immediately to a world cup final.
10/07/2018, 20:18 - Damian Rumble: Perhaps that was the plan all along...
10/07/2018, 20:40 - Damian Rumble: French Defence looking pretty good
10/07/2018, 20:52 - Rob;: England-Belgium in the third place playoff would be the biggest dry hump possible
10/07/2018, 20:52 - Rob;: The sequel to the dead rubber group game
10/07/2018, 21:01 - David;: You should arrange a last minute return to the embassy. Make sure Steve has an important engagement finishing 10 minutes before to keep it interesting. Can he make it this time?
10/07/2018, 21:02 - David;: France are a massive bunch of time wasting cunts
10/07/2018, 21:03 - David;: Hope even if it's croatia they lose the final
10/07/2018, 21:10 - Paul Dickinson: I can taste the butthurt already

11/07/2018, 09:22 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
11/07/2018, 09:31 - Sam;: That article isn‚Äôt about a massive cunt Damo?
11/07/2018, 09:33 - David;: At last, someone is listening. #justiceforthe8.33%
11/07/2018, 10:26 - David;: Ronaldo on 73,000 a day. Ah.
11/07/2018, 10:26 - David;: So what was a high weekly wage for one of the better squad players has become a daily wage.
11/07/2018, 10:27 - Sam;: Yeah but only for four years.. hardly worth it
11/07/2018, 10:28 - Damian Rumble: I actually have no idea what I would do with 73,000 a day
11/07/2018, 10:28 - Sam;: Well I‚Äôd start with a decent lunch.
11/07/2018, 10:29 - David;: I'd spend it all on very cheap low grade 90s snacks like chomps and transformers. Just accumulate a huge lifetime supply to gump through steadily.
11/07/2018, 10:29 - David;: To the point it becomes difficult to move in your house without eating through boxes of spicy tomatoes
11/07/2018, 10:31 - Sam;: And um bongo
11/07/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: Lol 292,000 chomps a day
11/07/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: Or maybe closer to half that after tax, if that's something super rich people in Italy pay
11/07/2018, 10:40 - Rob;: I think I could eat 50 a day max
11/07/2018, 10:41 - Rob;: It would take me 16 years to eat one day's worth of Ronaldo's Chomps at that rate
11/07/2018, 10:47 - David;: Lol, I'm so glad you made that calculation. I'd like to always recieve wages translated into the exchange rate of chomps.
11/07/2018, 10:48 - David;: Or rather 'chomp years'
11/07/2018, 10:48 - Damian Rumble: Cheeky sweep stake on how long it will take the Thai cave boys to come become a movie? I reckon there will be one out by Xmas.
11/07/2018, 10:50 - David;: Are chomps still 10p though? This must have changed.
11/07/2018, 10:51 - David;: I feel very strongly that chomp production should be nationalised to guarantee a below-cost sale price of 10p for ever.
11/07/2018, 10:52 - David;: Until it becomes a huge drain on government spending - eating deeply into the NHS budget.
11/07/2018, 10:57 - Rob;: They're 25p now

11/07/2018, 12:58 - David;: Would not be a good exam answer. Very choice.
11/07/2018, 12:59 - Sam;: Ah rass
11/07/2018, 13:09 - Rob;: 'I'm just using the linguistic framework I've inherited, which doesn't necessarily carry with it the inherent bias of each and every contributor to it, to express a fairly common non-literal concept understood and widely accepted because I am a 16-year-old GCSE student Mr Agard

11/07/2018, 13:24 - David;: Yeah I definitely think that's how he saw it panning out in his mind
11/07/2018, 13:25 - David;: Stunned when they expected words and details rather than pissed chanting
11/07/2018, 13:25 - Rob;: Imagined being awarded a huge trophy and getting carried out by all 27 other members
11/07/2018, 13:27 - Sam;: All this job needs is a bloody good bloke to tell em what‚Äôs what
11/07/2018, 13:29 - Rob;: The Brexiteers are exactly the bunch who _could_ organise a piss up in a brewery
11/07/2018, 13:30 - Rob;: If not a divorce at international level
11/07/2018, 13:31 - Rob;: A league 2 divorce at best

11/07/2018, 17:21 - Damian Rumble: Same place as you dipshit
11/07/2018, 17:21 - Phill: Enjoy your hollow satisfaction.

11/07/2018, 17:30 - Paul Dickinson: Is it the greatest poem of our generation?
11/07/2018, 17:30 - Phill: You're a fucking fareweather fan too if you don't know the opening lines to three lions
11/07/2018, 17:34 - Phill: My arsehole. My brother. My sister. My mother. Puckered and weathered by slurry and strain. My glorious arsehole. Without you, I am nothing. With you, I am everything.
11/07/2018, 17:35 - Phill: Ignore the clap trap scat man peddling that shit scam. The real truth is in the honest work of the arsehole.
11/07/2018, 17:38 - Phill: Digging. I dig and clean and scrub my arsehole. Dig away the day, keep the shit stains at bay, guard the smelly skid mark in the dark cotton crease of the taint.

11/07/2018, 19:37 - Phill: Nah I'm alright at the minute. It's just this work cup and weather have taken their toll. Near constant boozing and eating out.
11/07/2018, 19:38 - Paul Dickinson: Waiting for an interception on a pass back in the 90th minute
11/07/2018, 19:40 - Phill: It's slurrying home, it's slurrying, football's slurrying home.

13/07/2018, 12:33 - Phill: That's what you get when you don't leave at dawn
13/07/2018, 12:34 - Phill: There's some nice road works just before dolgellau that will probably hold you up for 30 mins
13/07/2018, 12:37 - Phill: If no one's bought sun cream can someone pick up a bottle. Sambos burning up.
13/07/2018, 12:47 - Phill: Paul has suncream. IGNORE.
13/07/2018, 12:58 - Sam;: Scratch all previous messages about beer. Buy some crates. Beer should flow communally. Risidual lager required
13/07/2018, 13:00 - Rob;: Have you finished yours already?
13/07/2018, 13:02 - Sam;: Yes. It doesn‚Äôt matter if we over buy beer. Just means tomorrow is sorted. With the tricount app no one is going to be short changed
13/07/2018, 13:03 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
13/07/2018, 13:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Is the water situation actually that bad?
13/07/2018, 13:08 - Phill: Got about an eighth of a bucket after a few hours
13/07/2018, 13:08 - Phill: Probably a bit less
13/07/2018, 13:09 - David;: Rob, biy water
13/07/2018, 13:09 - David;: We've done our shop in Welshpool, heading out now.
13/07/2018, 13:10 - David;: Rob/Stefan sounds like main thing you need to get is lager and water.
13/07/2018, 13:12 - Paul Dickinson: Lots of Stella and water
13/07/2018, 13:14 - David;: So you guys didn't buy beer? Or already worked through all if it?
13/07/2018, 13:18 - Phill: Sambo is just pounding it down
13/07/2018, 13:19 - David;: What rate are we talking? How did you underbuy this much?
13/07/2018, 13:19 - David;: A shortage by 1pm
13/07/2018, 13:21 - Phill: He's gumped 40% of his stash already and when I pointed out it was 1pm and we are likely to be up until the early hours his confidence in the original 10 cans was shattered.
13/07/2018, 13:22 - David;: >10 cans
13/07/2018, 13:22 - David;: >10.
13/07/2018, 13:22 - David;: 7.
13/07/2018, 13:27 - David;: We sorted our booze independently so factor us out of the communal lot.

13/07/2018, 13:40 - Rob;: Oh no Jaaaaccckkkk!
13/07/2018, 13:44 - Phill: Fuck them jack. They don't own you.
13/07/2018, 13:44 - Phill: Anyone brining a footy?
13/07/2018, 13:44 - David;: Raining where we are. If it pisses it down at least will replensih spring.
13/07/2018, 13:44 - Rob;: Yeah I'm pickling one in brine now
13/07/2018, 13:44 - Phill: Dave there is a significant percolation lag
13/07/2018, 13:45 - Phill: We won't see the benefit whilst we here
13/07/2018, 13:45 - Rob;: We were wondering about that
13/07/2018, 13:46 - Phill: The drawdown time of the groundwater is probably days here. STAY.
13/07/2018, 13:53 - David;: Just come when you get it done - sat or sunday?
13/07/2018, 13:53 - David;: Nah it's rapid. If there's a storm river swells next day
13/07/2018, 13:53 - David;: Also it would direct fill buckets we leave out
13/07/2018, 13:58 - Phill: River ‚â† spring

14/07/2018, 12:20 - Jack G;: Not too bad. Got around 450GB left to copy and then got to do some validation and integrity checks. The disks are quite slow so should be finished by tomorrow morning I reckon
14/07/2018, 16:11 - Rob;: Is the plan to go to the lake on the way back up?
14/07/2018, 16:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes

15/07/2018, 14:18 - David;: It is the historic fate of 6th army to defend Stalingrad to the last man. Your sacrifice will stand as an inspiration to every soldier in the greater Reich. No permission to surrender can be granted.

19/07/2018, 18:32 - Damian Rumble: Probably around ¬£70
19/07/2018, 18:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Fuck sake, tell me the amount and whonits split by
19/07/2018, 18:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Everyone ignore the last figures
19/07/2018, 18:56 - Damian Rumble: So my fuel is 64.08 shared between Rob, Stefan and myself
19/07/2018, 18:57 - Damian Rumble: Also is everyone happy to pay ¬£10 each for the MD, LSD and valiums?

19/07/2018, 19:09 - Sam;: You only gave me 140 though mate
19/07/2018, 19:09 - Paul Dickinson: Also Phil said I owed him ¬£60 so gave him that but it‚Äôs calculated it differently so Phil has ¬£60 of the ¬£200
19/07/2018, 19:11 - Sam;: It affects all the other calculations so that payment needs amending or just removing as I paid Phil in cash for petrol
19/07/2018, 19:12 - Sam;: Or you just owe 204 as well as the 60 to Phil
19/07/2018, 19:13 - Paul Dickinson: I though the ¬£60 was based on this as I already bought the petrol
19/07/2018, 19:14 - Paul Dickinson: Think Phil needs to take on some transferring of mine
19/07/2018, 19:15 - Sam;: Basically yeah, there shouldn‚Äôt be any side payments. That‚Äôs the whole point.
19/07/2018, 19:16 - Paul Dickinson: Ah I got suckered in via side payment
19/07/2018, 19:24 - Sam;: If Hamish can amend and resend to reflect it then we‚Äôre back on track.
19/07/2018, 19:26 - David;: Just put in a ¬£60 transfer from paul to phil, can you do that?
19/07/2018, 19:53 - Phill: Nah.
19/07/2018, 19:53 - Phill: Paul, the ¬£60 you paid when we left chippy was for half of Becca's hire car as per our agreement. This was never put into tricount.
19/07/2018, 19:54 - Phill: The 60 you gave me when we left the Tesco, on the way home was what was in tricount at the the end of the week.
19/07/2018, 19:54 - Phill: It wasn't.necessarily you who owed it to me, but tricount worked it out as the easiest
19/07/2018, 19:54 - Phill: ¬£25 from sambo was for petrol.
19/07/2018, 19:55 - Phill: As far as I'm aware I don't owe anyone anything, as I believe I was in the green by about ¬£70 when we left.
19/07/2018, 19:57 - Paul Dickinson: I can sort it out when back in Chicago I think. Have my hsbc pin card thing there. Just let me know what needs doing
19/07/2018, 19:58 - Phill: Looks like sambo now owes me ¬£48, but Paul's already given me this.
19/07/2018, 19:59 - Phill: So about owes me nowt.
19/07/2018, 19:59 - Phill: Sambo owes me nowt*
19/07/2018, 20:08 - Sam;: You didn‚Äôt put the petrol through tricount did you Phil?
19/07/2018, 20:15 - Phill: Nah
19/07/2018, 20:15 - Phill: Don't see the point of it, it's quite obvious who's is who's car
19/07/2018, 20:18 - Sam;: Good, exactly. It‚Äôs just that you‚Äôve jumped the gun by telling Paul he‚Äôs owes you ¬£60 in tricount as the totals have changed since. 

Paul - just pay as per the totals on Hamish‚Äôs screenshot and I‚Äôll send you back the ¬£140 to your hsbc yeah?
19/07/2018, 20:18 - Phill: Yeah I gumped the Jun.
19/07/2018, 20:19 - Phill: Hamish showed me the tricount total just before we left and that was the one on which Paul owed me ¬£61
19/07/2018, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: That was before damos final additions
19/07/2018, 20:23 - Phill: Yeah exactly. Classic jumping of the gun.
19/07/2018, 20:23 - Phill: Or poor admin on damos part. You decide.
19/07/2018, 20:37 - Rob;: Phil I'll buy you a pint next time we're in a pub as I basically gumped all your MD when high, and you did give me some of your ket too
19/07/2018, 20:40 - Phill: Nah don't worry about it. Drugs get gumped. I still had a good time.
20/07/2018, 11:07 - Damian Rumble: Today is the first day that I've not felt utterly ravaged by wales
20/07/2018, 11:07 - David;: Yeah. My arse yesterday.

20/07/2018, 11:26 - Phill: Just about to gump some pate and baguette
20/07/2018, 11:26 - David;: I was broken
20/07/2018, 11:27 - Phill: Ketamine will be your mate all night, then when you wake up, he'll greet you with a chirpy "morning mate, coffee?"
20/07/2018, 11:28 - Damian Rumble: The whole weekend did feel a bit like a festival. Lots of music and blooting. Not a lot of sleep.
20/07/2018, 11:28 - Phill: Your boys LSD and MDMA won't do that for you.
20/07/2018, 11:53 - Rob;: More than drugs at play I think, not having to go back to work would have really helped

21/07/2018, 10:58 - Rob;: >¬£50m for Richarlson
21/07/2018, 11:18 - Sam;: What‚Äôs the state of play on tricount?
21/07/2018, 19:21 - Phill: That feel when bidet after a really sloppy shit
21/07/2018, 19:22 - Phill: <Media omitted>
22/07/2018, 11:36 - Damian Rumble: I like what man u and spurs have done with thier kits this year. Dark sublimation around the base.
23/07/2018, 12:45 - Rob;: BREAKING Moutinho to Wolves. A very football manager 2008 deal
23/07/2018, 19:47 - Paul Dickinson: BREAKING: Pepe linked with move to Wolves
23/07/2018, 19:49 - Phill: >not buying footy manager 2008 from a charity shop, then buying players thinking they're still relevant

25/07/2018, 10:11 - Sam;: Gazidis to Milan? It‚Äôs a revolution at arsenal
25/07/2018, 10:29 - Rob;: Would be strange if it happened, he's the one who got Wenger out and employed all the other people to dilute his power
25/07/2018, 10:30 - Rob;: Has definitely been more of a weasely, smarmy marketeer than anything else in his stay so far
25/07/2018, 10:39 - Sam;: Maybe that‚Äôs why he‚Äôs hired those people and emery. Proper transition with powers passed on a no one person having loads as it was with him and wenger
25/07/2018, 10:41 - Rob;: I wouldn't say he really had very much power himself until last season. I'd say this is much more about Milan wanting him than it being planned for him to move on by Arsenal
25/07/2018, 15:41 - Damian Rumble: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

25/07/2018, 17:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Classic
25/07/2018, 17:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Still can't believe we let damo win one
25/07/2018, 17:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Goodway: the dynasty
25/07/2018, 17:28 - David;: Yeah, 3 wins in 4 years.
25/07/2018, 17:28 - David;: Very even before that period
25/07/2018, 17:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Only player to retain the title
25/07/2018, 17:29 - David;: Like the square plaque better. She reckoned we can fit a second row onto it.
25/07/2018, 17:30 - Hamish Sinclair: I reckon so
25/07/2018, 17:30 - David;: Yeah, remains the sole title defence in jules chippet history
25/07/2018, 17:30 - Hamish Sinclair: By the time we get a second row it will be such a grotty trophy
25/07/2018, 17:30 - Rob;: Looks great
25/07/2018, 17:30 - Rob;: Did they polish the main trophy  for you too?
25/07/2018, 17:30 - David;: That's what you want. The grot. The passion. The history
25/07/2018, 17:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Are we still planning on doing the draft this year?
25/07/2018, 17:30 - Damian Rumble: Looking good
25/07/2018, 17:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, quite kike how the ashes is so grotty
25/07/2018, 17:33 - David;: No, didn't ask.
25/07/2018, 17:36 - Paul Dickinson: Better to keep the grot on there
25/07/2018, 17:37 - Paul Dickinson: Gets washed with booze once a year
25/07/2018, 17:37 - David;: Polished it with gin mate
25/07/2018, 17:38 - Hamish Sinclair: The handing over ceremony on top of a mountain each year
25/07/2018, 17:38 - David;: I want to get 'Jules Chippet' engraved onto tue face of the cup itself. Would complete the scope
25/07/2018, 17:39 - David;: In very flowery italic lettering
25/07/2018, 18:13 - David;: How does that work again? You have to all select at one time and can't have tge same players?
25/07/2018, 18:13 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôs nice and intense
25/07/2018, 18:14 - David;: Could be good. No transfers? So all about the squad.
25/07/2018, 18:15 - David;: Or can you do transfers between players?
25/07/2018, 18:16 - David;: First pick will be mental. Who gets salah
25/07/2018, 18:17 - David;: Woukd have to wait until transfer window closes or could get fucked by big players leaving
25/07/2018, 19:05 - Hamish Sinclair: I think you can do transfers, one a week between the pool remaining or between each other
25/07/2018, 19:06 - David;: Hmm, how does it work between each other - do they have to be straight swaps or is there cash involved?
25/07/2018, 23:15 - David;: Rob, Hamish have you not created teams yet? You're not on the 'waiting to be added' list of the league.
25/07/2018, 23:15 - David;: Nor Phil actually
26/07/2018, 00:09 - David;: <Media omitted>
26/07/2018, 00:20 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm still "scouting"
26/07/2018, 00:20 - Paul Dickinson: I have the most advanced team you‚Äôre likely to see
26/07/2018, 00:21 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôs been through about 30 revisions
26/07/2018, 00:22 - David;: Jahanbakhsh? Bless you.
26/07/2018, 00:26 - Hamish Sinclair: The mate, tearing up the eridevise
26/07/2018, 00:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Could be Luis Suarez or Alfonso alves
26/07/2018, 07:53 - Damian Rumble: Did we ever finalise the tricount for wales?
26/07/2018, 08:04 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
26/07/2018, 08:04 - Hamish Sinclair: I sent this a while ago
26/07/2018, 08:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Damo I would need your bank details
26/07/2018, 08:25 - David;: Paul what's the situation with your US account?
26/07/2018, 12:12 - Paul Dickinson: Sambo, can you ping over Dave the 140
26/07/2018, 12:27 - Rob;: Tricount should let individuals enter their bank details then do all the payments automatically. Effortless budgeting
26/07/2018, 12:27 - Hamish Sinclair: It actually doea
26/07/2018, 12:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Via paypal
26/07/2018, 12:27 - Hamish Sinclair: But you'd all have to download it
26/07/2018, 12:28 - Sam;: Yep, will sort out my payments tonight
26/07/2018, 12:30 - David;: Isn't it ¬£200?
26/07/2018, 12:40 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah but remember the whole situation where I paid Phil 60. So sambo only has 140 of the 200. The tricount was going to take this into account I thought and new totals? I left 200 in the uk to keep things streamlined as I will have to set up my internet banking again and get a new code thing
26/07/2018, 14:55 - Paul Dickinson: Facebook stock down 20%. We fucked them moving the thread
26/07/2018, 15:01 - Damian Rumble: London has been swamped with adverts recently from Facebook pleading to be taken seriously on data security
26/07/2018, 15:01 - Paul Dickinson: They‚Äôre in Chicago as well
26/07/2018, 15:02 - Phill: They're everywhere
26/07/2018, 15:02 - Phill: The best ones are on telly
26/07/2018, 15:02 - Paul Dickinson: On WhatsApp we can‚Äôt be harvested due to the encryption. Our thread represented $100bn worth of harvestable value
26/07/2018, 15:02 - Phill: Sharing data with third parties "WE THINK THATS NOT OK"
26/07/2018, 15:04 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
26/07/2018, 15:05 - Sam;: Makes him look a bit like ronaldo
26/07/2018, 15:07 - Phill: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44968386
26/07/2018, 15:07 - Phill: IT BEGINS
26/07/2018, 15:22 - Stefan;: Hopefully before long we'll be like California - ring your doctor, tell them you have a headache and get a ticket for a spliff vending machine
26/07/2018, 15:22 - David;: I don't know but the updated total says ¬£200, for rent and the booze and food shops etc. I don't know how you paying phil ¬£60 interacts with that.
26/07/2018, 15:28 - Paul Dickinson: Phil said the ¬£60 was a tricount value I owed him at one point. So I think we need to factor that in and it‚Äôll rearrange the totals
26/07/2018, 15:30 - Hamish Sinclair: I think the 60quid needs to be assumed to be Paul's money in Phil's possession
26/07/2018, 15:30 - Hamish Sinclair: I don't think I can factor in your payment
26/07/2018, 15:32 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah, that‚Äôs tricount cash
26/07/2018, 15:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Who has Paul's other money?
26/07/2018, 15:33 - Paul Dickinson: Sambo
26/07/2018, 15:33 - Paul Dickinson: He‚Äôs doing transfers later on that
26/07/2018, 15:33 - Hamish Sinclair: So Paul left 260quid I'm the country?
26/07/2018, 15:34 - Paul Dickinson: No, 200
26/07/2018, 15:34 - Hamish Sinclair: 140 with sam
26/07/2018, 15:34 - Hamish Sinclair: 60 with phil
26/07/2018, 15:34 - Paul Dickinson: Yep
26/07/2018, 15:34 - Paul Dickinson: That is all for tricount
26/07/2018, 15:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Ok so Phil pays Dave 60 and Sam pays Dave 140
26/07/2018, 15:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Hen Paul owes dave ¬£3.99 and owes Phil ¬£2.26
26/07/2018, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Them everyone else carries on as normal
26/07/2018, 15:37 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah I can‚Äôt get my online banking working at the moment but when I do then I can resolve the smaller amounts. As long as the big payment is sorted we‚Äôre good
26/07/2018, 15:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh I'm sure you can sort the pennies another time
26/07/2018, 17:56 - David;: Ok, but then Sambo independently has to pay Phil ¬£50. So why doesn't Sambo just pay me ¬£190 and Phil owes me a tenner at some point (and yeah we don't worry about to ¬£3s). That gets rid of 1 transfer.
26/07/2018, 17:57 - Phill: Dave's method easier
26/07/2018, 17:58 - Damian Rumble: @12813868870 - the great disrupter
26/07/2018, 17:58 - Paul Dickinson: No Damian
26/07/2018, 17:58 - Paul Dickinson: My cash is in the uk
26/07/2018, 17:59 - Phill: Nah this one's my fault
26/07/2018, 17:59 - Phill: I jumped the gun, because I was going on holiday 24 hours after we left Wales for 2 weeks and didn't want to sort anything whilst I was away
26/07/2018, 17:59 - Phill: At that point Paul owed me ¬£61 until you piped up a week later
26/07/2018, 18:01 - Phill: By the way, got home after Wales, and my sister enquired about the weed. Whether we thought it was stronger than usual.
26/07/2018, 18:01 - Phill: She said it's the strongest weed she's ever smoked and she smokes a lot...
26/07/2018, 18:01 - Phill: She said she smokes a bifta to herself and was out of it for like 2 days
26/07/2018, 18:05 - Rob;: And we were adding hash to it
26/07/2018, 18:05 - Phill: Yeah just crumbling in a bit of hash
26/07/2018, 18:05 - Phill: Kek forgot about the hash
26/07/2018, 18:05 - Paul Dickinson: No one turned electric
26/07/2018, 18:06 - Phill: No, but we were all supporting sambo having a shit
26/07/2018, 18:06 - Sam;: Yeah the voyage to defecate
26/07/2018, 18:06 - David;: Lol, that joint
26/07/2018, 18:07 - David;: The joint to end joints. Mythical status
26/07/2018, 18:07 - Phill: <Media omitted>
26/07/2018, 18:07 - Phill: Love the smoke in the room of that photo
26/07/2018, 18:08 - Phill: Really adds the effect
26/07/2018, 18:09 - David;: I was thinking my wales hangover was different to usual usual - i think it was primarily a weed rather than mdma hangover. So you got the cripling emotional low but also the brain fog.
26/07/2018, 18:10 - David;: But some post-acid clarity to take the edge off
26/07/2018, 18:10 - Phill: A real zonker
26/07/2018, 18:13 - David;: 'Clark Kent manga'd to fuck'
26/07/2018, 18:14 - Phill: So much shit I don't remember. Did I throw up my drink when that observation was offered up?
26/07/2018, 18:22 - David;: https://www.deviantart.com/faddawdle/art/Clark-Kent-407589350
26/07/2018, 18:23 - David;: Not sure but it hit you hard. Not on the level of Paul's no mash incident.
26/07/2018, 18:24 - Phill: Yeah no mash was another level
26/07/2018, 18:24 - David;: During which I remember the phrase 'I've used up 1,000 years of laughter in 30 seconds'
26/07/2018, 18:24 - Phill: Don't think we'll see that level of laughter again for a while
26/07/2018, 18:24 - David;: Nah maybe never
26/07/2018, 18:24 - Phill: Would be funny if laughter was like money, and Paul spent his entire life budget in 30 seconds
26/07/2018, 18:29 - Paul Dickinson: Worth it though
26/07/2018, 18:29 - Paul Dickinson: Only bangers
26/07/2018, 18:31 - Sam;: Sooo what‚Äôs the upshot on tricount?
26/07/2018, 18:31 - Paul Dickinson: ‚òùüèº this guy
26/07/2018, 18:32 - Sam;: Cool. I‚Äôll just keep the 140 then and pay my own ones.
26/07/2018, 18:35 - David;: This
26/07/2018, 18:37 - David;: Then you owe Rob ¬£100 and Stefan ¬£20.
26/07/2018, 18:43 - Sam;: Cool cheers
26/07/2018, 18:51 - Sam;: Ok. Rob and Stefan paid, new your bonk details Dave

27/07/2018, 12:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Is it on Netflix?
27/07/2018, 12:23 - David;: 4od
27/07/2018, 12:24 - Sam;: Gonna get on it
27/07/2018, 12:24 - David;: The interview with Dick Cheney is great as well
27/07/2018, 12:24 - David;: Ridiculous they got him to agree to it
27/07/2018, 12:25 - Stefan;: Yeah I watched the first one last night
27/07/2018, 12:26 - Stefan;: The guy who made a kid's tv programme about how to shoot guns was great
27/07/2018, 12:26 - David;: Second episode is much better
27/07/2018, 12:27 - David;: I wasn't really rating it after the first, it seemed a bit broad.
27/07/2018, 12:27 - David;: but yeah the gun stuff is ridiculous
27/07/2018, 12:30 - David;: At one point he gets a congressman to get his arse out and run backwards into him shouting 'america', on the premise that it would be a way to counter homophobic Islamic State fighters.
27/07/2018, 12:35 - / James Ball: Ah, I've been meaning to watch it. Tonight's plan is set then
27/07/2018, 12:36 - Stefan;: And now the congressman has had to resign because of it
27/07/2018, 12:37 - David;: Yeah, that and shouting nigger repeatedly at the top of his voice on instruction
27/07/2018, 12:38 - / James Ball: Amazing. The Sarah Palin one not aired yet?

30/07/2018, 11:12 - Rob;: I think I've read most of it just while browsing book shops
30/07/2018, 11:12 - David;: He's also just talked about the 'teusday club' led by Adams.
31/07/2018, 14:43 - Rob;: Great that Mourinho's taken his usual trajectory of bedding-in season; season of improvement; making it all about him and how much of a cunt he is season without winning he title in the middle

01/08/2018, 12:43 - David;: A high background level of retardation
01/08/2018, 12:45 - David;: But is that just because we can understand all the retarded grot here? There might be a french dan and karen but we'd never know
01/08/2018, 13:02 - Rob;: For a second this reminded me of Scott and Dan and made me think Scott had had a sex change

01/08/2018, 13:03 - Phill: Yeah but other nations don't seem to cater for their retarded sector
01/08/2018, 13:04 - Rob;: Dunno, hard to access that as an outsider
01/08/2018, 13:04 - Phill: Example:
01/08/2018, 13:05 - Rob;: *assess
01/08/2018, 13:05 - Phill: French supermarkets put quality above ease of use. You have to put some effort in e.g washing your veg, cutting the head off the chicken, removing the bits of the prawn you can't eat etc.
01/08/2018, 13:06 - Phill: UK supermarkets on the other hand just wrap everything in cellophane and wash the salad in chlorine. All meat is wrapped and shit tier quality. Tried to buy goats cheese yesterday and all they had was a 'spreadable'.
01/08/2018, 13:06 - Phill: Catering to the GIMP population
01/08/2018, 13:08 - Phill: At a British market all you have is pikeys selling t-shirts made by fruit of the loom with a fucking flame graphic on
01/08/2018, 13:09 - Phill: French markets are the fucking bollocks
01/08/2018, 13:19 - Paul Dickinson: We‚Äôre fatter than USA now?
01/08/2018, 13:19 - Paul Dickinson: Dan and Karen‚Äôs kids fatter than randy and sues
01/08/2018, 13:46 - Rob;: Agree the French are uncompromising on food,  but they'll have grot
01/08/2018, 13:46 - Rob;: Le Bot-Brain wedding will have been a thing there
01/08/2018, 13:47 - Paul Dickinson: We‚Äôll all thin down with brexit though
01/08/2018, 13:47 - Paul Dickinson: The food shortages
01/08/2018, 14:30 - David;: Brexit - the one umbilical chord we had to the civilised world. Best to sever that and really embrace the grot.
01/08/2018, 14:30 - Paul Dickinson: <Media omitted>
01/08/2018, 14:34 - Damian Rumble: Totally stealing this
01/08/2018, 14:34 - David;: At least when everything is clearly just as shit as it always has been the excuse has been taken away so we will have to confront the true extent of our own shitness
01/08/2018, 14:35 - David;: There's no hiding place. In deep brexit, no one can hear you scream
01/08/2018, 14:36 - Paul Dickinson: Dan and Karen can‚Äôt keep eating supermarket frozen pizza forever
01/08/2018, 14:46 - David;: Well they will continue gumping the pizza but can't blame the fact that the NHS can't afford the resulting triple bypass on the EU
01/08/2018, 14:47 - Damian Rumble: Ah but then it will be the Eurocrats fault for not letting us have cake and eat it...
01/08/2018, 15:09 - / James Ball: And we can all sit in the queue of lorries on the M20 to leave the country
01/08/2018, 15:09 - / James Ball: It's going to be great
01/08/2018, 15:13 - Rob;: I'm personally looking forward to not having to carry an ehic card. Weighing me down
01/08/2018, 15:17 - Damian Rumble: I've always hated straight bananas.
01/08/2018, 15:24 - / James Ball: I mostly hate moving and working easily in other countries
01/08/2018, 15:29 - / James Ball: Actually, I was talking with some colleagues about post brexit small and medium European music tours
01/08/2018, 15:31 - / James Ball: The additional cost of visas and carnet could end the business for smaller bands and groups
01/08/2018, 15:32 - Damian Rumble: You know every day I go the shops I think to myself... I wish I could buy cheap Chinese knock offs rather than these expensive European products. If only the EUs customs union wasn't preventing us from trading with anywhere from outside of Europe then we could be a modern trading nation... That we definitely ARE NOT today...
01/08/2018, 15:32 - Paul Dickinson: But we‚Äôre so grotty we‚Äôll not be able to make any music going forward. Nothing lost
01/08/2018, 15:32 - Paul Dickinson: Dan and Karen not in the habit of writing songs
01/08/2018, 15:35 - / James Ball: Ah well, we just export literal got music. Like grime
01/08/2018, 15:35 - / James Ball: literal grot*
01/08/2018, 16:34 - Paul Dickinson: Ah James, you missed hearing about Damian‚Äôs ideal form of government which was a computer that made all of our decisions for us
01/08/2018, 16:35 - Paul Dickinson: Brexit will bring this a step closer to reality
01/08/2018, 16:36 - Damian Rumble: All hail Colossus
01/08/2018, 16:40 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
01/08/2018, 16:49 - / James Ball: Colossus is already a real computer Damian, you need to come up with a new name.
01/08/2018, 16:50 - Paul Dickinson: And scrap the idea all together
01/08/2018, 16:59 - / James Ball: Damo, who would build the computer that overthrows us?
01/08/2018, 17:00 - Damian Rumble: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossus:_The_Forbin_Project
01/08/2018, 17:00 - Damian Rumble: Forbin will build it obviously
01/08/2018, 17:03 - / James Ball: >science fiction thriller film
01/08/2018, 21:32 - David;: Ah so this already exists. Thats dissapointing
01/08/2018, 21:51 - David;: Rob are lacazette and Auba both likely to start?
01/08/2018, 21:51 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
01/08/2018, 21:53 - Rob;: I don't think they have played together for very long in preseason. Aubemeyang the safer bet
01/08/2018, 21:54 - Paul Dickinson: Is firmino going to start?
01/08/2018, 21:54 - David;: Yeah, don't want him shoved out wide though
01/08/2018, 21:55 - David;: 50/50. Back in squad but not played yet in pre-season
01/08/2018, 21:55 - David;: Could be on bench for west ham and play after
01/08/2018, 21:56 - David;: Also sturridge has been looking sharp pre-season
01/08/2018, 21:56 - Paul Dickinson: Hmmm. Might have to swap him out for first game week
01/08/2018, 21:58 - Paul Dickinson: This will require at least 6 hours research
01/08/2018, 21:59 - David;: Sam can you feed me any morsels of luke shaw information? I'm feeding off scraps
01/08/2018, 21:59 - David;: Young is gone. Dead from world cup? Shaw is a person again?
01/08/2018, 22:00 - David;: Who or what is your defence now?
01/08/2018, 22:00 - David;: He's even been slagging off valencia. Is no one sacred?
01/08/2018, 22:03 - David;: Jones back early from his holiday. What does any of this mean?
01/08/2018, 22:15 - Sam;: Hard to say. Bailly is in, shaw is in. Valencia should be fine. Smalling Jones or lindelof? Probably smalling for the first game unless injured
01/08/2018, 22:17 - David;: But mourinho slammed bailly's leadership qualities.
01/08/2018, 22:18 - Sam;: It‚Äôs all misdirection. Wait for the prestige
01/08/2018, 22:20 - David;: Also valencia's holiday. Such a long holiday.
01/08/2018, 22:20 - Sam;: The prestige Deivid
01/08/2018, 22:27 - David;: But he's probably in the state we were in after 5 days of Wales. Would you want to mark vardy after that?
01/08/2018, 22:29 - Sam;: Vardy is shit now
01/08/2018, 22:58 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
02/08/2018, 09:39 - Sam;: What‚Äôs the name of that type of chair that‚Äôs in Wales, the really comfortable lounger which is quite low with a long base. Looks like a skandi design
02/08/2018, 09:40 - Sam;: Rivage chair is what I‚Äôve come up with through google
02/08/2018, 09:42 - David;: Dunno it's the clasdic ikeq chair
02/08/2018, 09:42 - David;: *ikea
02/08/2018, 10:23 - Phill: Is it like the one I've got?
02/08/2018, 10:23 - Phill: If it is it's a classic - the Poang.
02/08/2018, 10:25 - Rob;: I think Sam means the ones with 4 legs, rather than the C shape like that
02/08/2018, 10:25 - Sam;: Nah, like the ones in Wales, nearest the fire. much lower to the ground not bouncy
02/08/2018, 10:25 - Sam;: Long base real lounging. Almost horizontal

02/08/2018, 10:31 - Damian Rumble: Looks like it has good froust potential
02/08/2018, 10:31 - Rob;: ¬£810 a month is a bad deal for sky and bt m8
02/08/2018, 10:31 - Phill: Sambo, if you want the chairs in Wales that are the classic one, it's called g-plan
02/08/2018, 10:33 - Phill: Specifically the ercol lounge chair circa 1960
02/08/2018, 10:34 - Sam;: Yeah yeah yeah. That‚Äôs it

02/08/2018, 10:49 - Hamish Sinclair: G plan and ercol chairs are so fucking expensive. Blame y cwm is sitting on a good mine

02/08/2018, 14:41 - Phill: Sitting in Aylesbury today waiting for the car to be done. Noticed alot of fine ass around. There must be a local ass gene in the area. Aylesbury Ass.
02/08/2018, 16:53 - Rob;: Crystal Palace's Max Meyer will earn 95K a week more than Christian Eriksen
02/08/2018, 16:54 - Rob;: 80K more than Mane

02/08/2018, 16:56 - Sam;: Free transfer
02/08/2018, 16:57 - Paul Dickinson: Oh so just load him up with wages
02/08/2018, 16:57 - Rob;: 70K a week for Eriksen would have been affordable a decade ago though
02/08/2018, 16:58 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
02/08/2018, 17:06 - / James Ball: First time I've ever built a wall, felt I should share. You can resume talking about football now.
02/08/2018, 17:07 - Paul Dickinson: How big is the wall going to be? Don‚Äôt stop there
02/08/2018, 17:08 - Rob;: Will it keep the Mexicans out?
02/08/2018, 17:08 - Rob;: Do you think the guest bedroom might be a bit pokey?
02/08/2018, 17:14 - Sam;: The most intense froust chamber ever built?

02/08/2018, 18:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Fantasy football team complete. This is my year

03/08/2018, 00:50 - Damian Rumble: Got a gas well burning out of control? Obviously the best solution is to nuke it
03/08/2018, 01:13 - Paul Dickinson: Fekin werked tho din it

03/08/2018, 10:06 - Hamish Sinclair: My arse is in tatters
03/08/2018, 10:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Had a vegan curry last night and I'm dealing with hot, gassy slurry
03/08/2018, 10:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Meat wouldn't do this to you
03/08/2018, 10:08 - Phill: >vegan
03/08/2018, 10:08 - Phill: >Trusting that witchcraft to not violate your colon
03/08/2018, 10:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Chickpea, sweet corn and lentil. The warning signs were there
03/08/2018, 10:20 - Rob;: I found out if you don't wash tinned pulses properly you get loads more fibre than you need because the water they're in contains savagely indigestible compounds
03/08/2018, 10:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Sounds like a great randomised control trial in the making
03/08/2018, 10:21 - Rob;: Like 400% of your recommended daily amount of fibre
03/08/2018, 10:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Feed Sam two Currys on two separate days
03/08/2018, 10:22 - Rob;: With a constant amount of MDMA
03/08/2018, 10:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Just waiting to break through
03/08/2018, 11:07 - David;: Lol so mdma is the dependent variable?
03/08/2018, 11:08 - Phill: Wish I'd recorded the elsan bit
03/08/2018, 11:08 - Phill: Stand up. I can't. Try. üí©
03/08/2018, 11:10 - Damian Rumble: Tbh that actually sounds pretty tasty...
03/08/2018, 11:11 - Phill: Remember going for a shit the day after and seeing Sam's pat on top basically covering the whole area of the circle
03/08/2018, 11:11 - Phill: Looked like Bolognese.
03/08/2018, 11:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh, would have been the best scene in the blame y cwm sitcom
03/08/2018, 11:20 - Rob;: It was nice that we were all there to support him
03/08/2018, 11:21 - Rob;: I would also like footage of Stefan and I discussing that we are each other's oldest friend while explosively emptying our arses and grunting in turn
03/08/2018, 11:25 - Stefan;: That was a beautiful moment
03/08/2018, 11:27 - Stefan;: The pauses halfway through fond reminiscences as I crank another turd out
03/08/2018, 11:30 - Sam;: Hammering the turd crank
03/08/2018, 12:33 - Sam;: The Oreo ice cream range is outstanding

03/08/2018, 12:45 - Phill: >mass produced ice cream. Scum.
03/08/2018, 12:47 - David;: But Sam we know how your bowels react to ice cream. Can you handle the fallout?
03/08/2018, 12:47 - David;: Is it worth it?
03/08/2018, 12:48 - Sam;: Mass produced because it‚Äôs so good that every fucker wants it.

Just piled a thick milkshake on top of it. A few beers later and there‚Äôs going to be quite a show tonight
03/08/2018, 12:49 - Phill: Say hi to Dan and Karen for me
03/08/2018, 12:51 - Sam;: Nah they‚Äôll just say they ‚Äòdon‚Äôt want a hello from that uppity prick‚Äô
03/08/2018, 12:53 - David;: Salt of the earth
03/08/2018, 12:54 - David;: Rags to riches
03/08/2018, 12:54 - Sam;: A bloody bloke is Dan
03/08/2018, 12:55 - Sam;: And Karen
03/08/2018, 13:01 - David;: Did you see ed balls' doccy about trumpland?
03/08/2018, 13:01 - Sam;: Gonna need to. What channel?
03/08/2018, 13:01 - David;: Bbc gumpplayer
03/08/2018, 13:03 - David;: Its good he gets into the real redneck grot. And hes there as a slightly posh english bloke, but embraces it
03/08/2018, 13:03 - David;: They get him in an old school wrestling costume and he has to act as the evil foreigner that they all hate
03/08/2018, 13:06 - Stefan;: Sounds excellent
03/08/2018, 13:06 - Stefan;: Do they straight up admit that they're racist and hate blacks/Muslims, like on Baron-Cohen's show?
03/08/2018, 13:07 - David;: Nah they sort of take the 'we're not racist just normal blokes, proud of the flag, misunderstood by the cosmopolitans'
03/08/2018, 13:07 - David;: He digs up a black and mexican trump supporter.
03/08/2018, 13:08 - David;: So much cognitive dissonance
03/08/2018, 13:09 - David;: She's like 'yeah well he just doesnt like criminals. I'm not a criminal. I wouldnt want a rapist coming here anyway'
03/08/2018, 13:21 - Stefan;: Classic
03/08/2018, 13:21 - Stefan;: Nobody can argue with that
03/08/2018, 13:26 - David;: Balls somehow managing to appear a lot more human and normal than when he was seeking elected office
03/08/2018, 14:06 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
03/08/2018, 14:08 - Sam;: I recognise the extraction system. World class gas removal technology
03/08/2018, 15:11 - Sam;: Dave, is this what it felt like when my gas woke you up in the flat?

Too hot? In 1858 a heatwave turned London into a stinking sewer
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45009749
03/08/2018, 15:12 - Paul Dickinson: What caused you to create gas like that?
03/08/2018, 15:13 - Sam;: It happened in an era marred by poor documentation so the causes are unknown
03/08/2018, 15:13 - Paul Dickinson: Not the Thornton mush?
03/08/2018, 15:14 - Sam;: Nah, that was benign, rice peas and tuna
03/08/2018, 17:16 - David;: I remember, it was nandos and then ice cream. The toxic mix
03/08/2018, 17:17 - David;: You had work nandos on friday then lager then ice cream. The perfect storm, your colon never stood a chance
03/08/2018, 17:18 - David;: Through 2 closed doors and an intervening room, but my survival instinct kicked in with the oxygen levels falling.
03/08/2018, 17:20 - Rob;: Breakfast at My Brother's Cologne
03/08/2018, 17:22 - Sam;: Ah yes. The spices from the chicken, the creamy dairy, the gaseous lager. A tinder box if ever there was one. 

So booze, spiced fast food and ice cream is what it takes to reach peak gas in both volume and stench
03/08/2018, 17:23 - David;: We need to start obsessively documenting which foods and conditions lead to which types of gas, then repeating experiments
03/08/2018, 17:23 - David;: There should be a website with this sort of data crowd-sourced
03/08/2018, 17:24 - Sam;: Yeah yeah yeah. And how to create the slurryest of slurrys
03/08/2018, 17:25 - David;: Yeah, like i've worked out a chilli con carne eaten on the come up of 2/3rds of an acid tab gives limitless volumes of odourless gas.
03/08/2018, 17:27 - Rob;: Shartipedia
03/08/2018, 17:31 - David;: Surely wikishart?
03/08/2018, 17:36 - Rob;: Or just Wikileaks?
03/08/2018, 17:46 - Phill: Gasitleaks

05/08/2018, 18:37 - Rob;: Who will start in defence for liverpool?
05/08/2018, 18:37 - Phill: Van dijk, Trent, Robertson and probably gomez/lovren filling the other spot
05/08/2018, 18:38 - Rob;: The either/or was not what I wanted to hear
05/08/2018, 18:49 - Phill: Can't help you with that final spot in afraid

06/08/2018, 10:36 - David;: I'm pretty sure it will be Robertson, Virgil, Gomez, Clyne for the first game, based on preseason
06/08/2018, 10:37 - David;: Then lovren and trent coming in for gomez ajd clyne in a week or 2
06/08/2018, 10:37 - David;: Forst choice is def Robertson, Virgil, Lovren, Trent but lovren and trent both went far in the world cup
06/08/2018, 10:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Salah and mane are both midfielders?? This is mebtal
06/08/2018, 10:58 - Rob;: Ah so the two most likely starters cost 6 instead of 5. Breaks team. I won't be investing.
06/08/2018, 10:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Are we doing a draft?
06/08/2018, 11:02 - Rob;: Can we find a free evening? I basically have tonight or Wednesday only - flying to Edinburgh Thursday night
06/08/2018, 11:32 - Phill: Tonight? 8pm?

06/08/2018, 16:07 - Damian Rumble: I'm out of draft. Will be flying to Croatia then. Not expecting to have much internet at that...
06/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: Possibly might be able to
06/08/2018, 17:32 - David;: Should be if it doesnt take too long. Sambo - a draft team?

06/08/2018, 17:38 - Sam;: Looking back in the thread the 8pm ting does no work for me. I‚Äôve retired from football management. I only work in an advisory capacity now
06/08/2018, 17:38 - Sam;: 60 seasons at spurs on FM09 was enough
06/08/2018, 17:39 - David;: Was it actually 60? How old was your character?
06/08/2018, 17:39 - Sam;: I was in my 80‚Äôs
06/08/2018, 17:40 - David;: Also hom many titles in that period?

06/08/2018, 17:54 - Paul Dickinson: Does your character ever die? Did you yourself develop Alzheimer‚Äôs or anything via proxy and start making ill informed decisions
06/08/2018, 17:55 - Paul Dickinson: At the very least I imagine you had a colostomy bag
06/08/2018, 18:10 - Phill: Shall we do Wednesday instead?
06/08/2018, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh i can do either
06/08/2018, 18:11 - David;: Yeah wednesday
06/08/2018, 18:11 - David;: I'll be in France gumping
06/08/2018, 18:12 - Phill: Where in France you going?
06/08/2018, 18:13 - David;: Dourdogne, near bergerac

06/08/2018, 18:15 - David;: Cabs etc.
06/08/2018, 18:15 - Phill: You driving?
06/08/2018, 18:17 - David;: Nah, plane. Parents booked this place and are  there for 2 weeks, we're just going for a week. Picking us up from airport. Pretty good, free villa for a week.
06/08/2018, 18:17 - David;: Will need to work in between gumping. Work and gump. Like game and watch
06/08/2018, 18:17 - Phill: French gump will consume you
06/08/2018, 18:18 - Phill: No such thing as le petit gump
06/08/2018, 18:18 - Phill: Grande gump every day
06/08/2018, 18:18 - Phill: Dawn till dusk

06/08/2018, 22:19 - David;: Ronny Venables to his mates.
06/08/2018, 22:20 - Rob;: Are Chelsea fucked?
06/08/2018, 22:21 - David;: Look pretty fucked. Hired a manager whose style is completely at odds with their squad structure
06/08/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: Courtois missing from training and Hazard saying he'd like to go
06/08/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: Who have they signed?
06/08/2018, 22:21 - David;: Yeah and everyone wanting out. I think the deliberate policy of constant churn and insecurity is finally catching up with them?
06/08/2018, 22:22 - David;: Rob Green
06/08/2018, 22:23 - David;: A 38 year-old Rob Green and Jorginho
06/08/2018, 22:23 - Rob;: Also Abramovic losing interest / being made to feel unwelcome in the UK over connections to Putin
06/08/2018, 22:23 - David;: Classic case of making a pact with the devil. Famously doesn't work out well.
06/08/2018, 22:23 - Rob;: Still have a big striker problem, unless Morata comes good
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: Jorginho look like a player though
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: A real footballer
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: I fancy him
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: He‚Äôs cute
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: Two feet
06/08/2018, 22:24 - David;: Very cute.
06/08/2018, 22:25 - Rob;: Cute
06/08/2018, 22:25 - David;: But one Jorginho does not a summer make.
06/08/2018, 22:26 - Rob;: Only have until 5pm on Thursday to sign someone else
06/08/2018, 22:26 - David;: Also Luiz looks gone
06/08/2018, 22:26 - Sam;: Stick an Kante (donk) on it
06/08/2018, 22:27 - Rob;: Doesn't do goals, Jorginho. Is he an assistant?
06/08/2018, 22:28 - Sam;: Pass master. The link. He had the best passing stats in Europe last season
06/08/2018, 22:28 - Rob;: Aquarius, the water-carrier
06/08/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: Tottenham's transfer window is interesting
06/08/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: Do you think they'll go on a last minute supermarket sweep?
06/08/2018, 22:35 - Sam;: Looks like Levy hasn‚Äôt risen to poch saying they need to be bolder in the transfer market. Sure up some big contracts, bring on more youth, maybe get some silly money off United for Toby jug
06/08/2018, 22:36 - Rob;: They've done well keeping hold of players
06/08/2018, 22:37 - Rob;: With the shit money they pay I've been hoping for them to get picked apart by the bigger clubs
06/08/2018, 22:37 - David;: what's Kane on?
06/08/2018, 22:37 - David;: and alli?
06/08/2018, 22:39 - Rob;: Had to look it up, but he's just gone up to 200K a week
06/08/2018, 22:41 - Rob;: So that's not bad, but he could probably double it again with a nice elsewhere
06/08/2018, 22:43 - Rob;: From last summer:
Dele Ali 50K a week 
Eriksen 75K
Vertongan 100K
Loris 120K
06/08/2018, 22:53 - Paul Dickinson: How shitty are arsenal looking?
06/08/2018, 23:00 - Rob;: Think we've done some sound business, plugged the obvious gaps and had an alright preseason. Might be a shit start considering it's City then Chelsea, but it's a decent squad now
06/08/2018, 23:01 - Paul Dickinson: But Chelsea are looking like the biggest bag of shit possible?
06/08/2018, 23:01 - Rob;: They have the potential to have had the worst window if they sell without replacing
06/08/2018, 23:02 - Rob;: Spurs could be fucked at he start if they don't buy considering how many players we t far in the world cup
06/08/2018, 23:02 - Paul Dickinson: But they‚Äôre footballers. They do football
06/08/2018, 23:03 - Rob;: But other footballers have had more than a week's preparation
06/08/2018, 23:04 - Rob;: Sambo who have United signed except Fred?
06/08/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: Lol Diogo Dalot
06/08/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: Do you Diogi Dalot?
06/08/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: Not much, no
07/08/2018, 00:09 - David;: Would Edward Woodward? Yes, Edward Woodwood would.
07/08/2018, 08:29 - Sam;: Dalot will be our Trent hopefully. Could sign alderweirald this week ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇ
07/08/2018, 08:32 - Phill: >Manshitster PooShyted
07/08/2018, 09:47 - Sam;: So they‚Äôve developed a luck index for football...
07/08/2018, 09:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh I've seen this
07/08/2018, 09:49 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
07/08/2018, 09:49 - Hamish Sinclair: This just conforms everything I've ever known
07/08/2018, 09:50 - David;: Yeah this isn't news.
07/08/2018, 09:54 - David;: Arsenal's Stan Kroenke makes offer to buy whole of London club - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45094538
07/08/2018, 09:55 - David;: The old ¬£557m loan. Pretty shit deposit there.
07/08/2018, 09:55 - Rob;: Yeah, Usmanov realised there was no point owning a minor stake
07/08/2018, 09:55 - Rob;: >Silent Stan
07/08/2018, 09:56 - Rob;: He's such a piece of shit
07/08/2018, 09:57 - David;: Usmanov made a bid for the whole club in 2015?
07/08/2018, 09:58 - David;: But stan was like oh, ah, weeel, no.
07/08/2018, 10:03 - Rob;: I think that was down to corporate law, where you have to make a formal bid for the whole lot once you reach a certain share. I think since Kronke got ahead of Usmanov he's basically controlled the club
07/08/2018, 10:04 - Rob;: Usmanoc has ties to the Everton owner, I imagine he might invest there now he's out of Arsenal
07/08/2018, 10:16 - Sam;: You‚Äôve been Glazered.
07/08/2018, 10:16 - Sam;: The AST will be booted off the board now in the compulsory purchase?
07/08/2018, 10:16 - Rob;: Not sure about that
07/08/2018, 10:17 - Rob;: There is an official fan share system too, would be strange for that to change
07/08/2018, 10:17 - Rob;: He has all the power as it is, no need to get rid of what are affectively good will gestures
07/08/2018, 10:19 - Sam;: But it‚Äôs a compulsory purchase.
07/08/2018, 10:19 - David;: Did he appoint emery?
07/08/2018, 10:20 - Sam;: Must have signed off on it on gazidis recco
07/08/2018, 10:35 - Rob;: Yeah probably had a sign-off but not an active rolw. He just wants his clubs  to make him money and that's it
07/08/2018, 10:36 - David;: Ah and you're forced to support that. It's a hicks/gilette scenario.
07/08/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: Yeah
07/08/2018, 10:37 - Rob;: I mean the football people doing stuff might manage to make us competitive, but it will be inspite of the owner
07/08/2018, 10:38 - David;: But he needs revvie from the champs league even to skim off money
07/08/2018, 10:38 - David;: Even if your aim is entirely mercenary sucess pays.
07/08/2018, 11:06 - Rob;: If only Kronke would agree
07/08/2018, 12:34 - Sam;: So courtios is just sacking off training this week then?
07/08/2018, 12:34 - Sam;: Not interested mate
07/08/2018, 12:40 - Rob;: I really, really, really hope they end up with Rob Green in goal
07/08/2018, 12:42 - Sam;: Willy caballero is funny enough

07/08/2018, 13:07 - David;: Should sign pickford and get the clean sweep
07/08/2018, 13:18 - Sam;: Heaton and pope are dead though right?
07/08/2018, 13:48 - David;: Heaton still fully dead?
07/08/2018, 13:48 - David;: How is dislocated shoulder a 6 month injury anyway? Salah got over it in 3 weeks m8
07/08/2018, 13:49 - Jack G;: Just shrug it off surely
07/08/2018, 13:52 - Rob;: Salah not a glove butler though
07/08/2018, 13:52 - Rob;: Might need to build up more strength to stop it happening again as a keeper

08/08/2018, 14:31 - Sam;: Not happening
08/08/2018, 14:31 - Paul Dickinson: What about de gea not wanting to sign a new contract?
08/08/2018, 14:44 - Sam;: Courtios to real now happening so nowhere for him to go
08/08/2018, 14:51 - Rob;: The draft at 7pm boys
08/08/2018, 14:51 - Rob;: You can't dodge the draft
08/08/2018, 14:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh, need to make it concise, no pissing around. Like speed chess
08/08/2018, 14:54 - Paul Dickinson: How do we do the draft?
08/08/2018, 14:55 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm in
08/08/2018, 14:55 - Phill: Fuck thought it was 8
08/08/2018, 14:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah nah 7
08/08/2018, 14:56 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm just looking at the rules now
08/08/2018, 14:57 - Hamish Sinclair: You can score it head to head rather than classic, might be a good way of differentiating it from the Jules chippet
08/08/2018, 14:58 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah do it head to head
08/08/2018, 14:58 - Paul Dickinson: Magnifies the butthurt
08/08/2018, 14:59 - Paul Dickinson: And everyone has a tense time
08/08/2018, 14:59 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm going to set up the league now so that people can just join at 7
08/08/2018, 14:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Need a name
08/08/2018, 15:01 - Sam;: The 10 Twats One Cup
08/08/2018, 15:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Jokes on you as it's actually a league format
08/08/2018, 15:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you playing Sam?
08/08/2018, 15:03 - Sam;: Lol no. I though head to head was Knockout
08/08/2018, 15:05 - Hamish Sinclair: I think you go head to head and win 3 points in classic football style
08/08/2018, 15:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Right code for league:
320032-74507
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Jack G;: Can we join now in advance then?
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Hamish Sinclair: And start making a list of players you want apparently
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
08/08/2018, 15:09 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôm getting invalid code
08/08/2018, 15:11 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
08/08/2018, 15:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you definitely applying to a draft league Paul?
08/08/2018, 15:14 - Paul Dickinson: Ah I see it lives outside the realm of the app
08/08/2018, 15:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Just reading the rules:

1. There is no budget, but I think 3 players of one team max still applies

2. It's a "snaking draft" which means the person who goes last in the first round goes first in the second round. This will all be randomly assigned

3. You can make 1 transfer request per week from the pool of players left. Bottom of league gets first pick

4. There are no captains
08/08/2018, 15:19 - Hamish Sinclair: We can have up to 10 players in the league. Do we want to invite others or keep it with the 5-6 We have
08/08/2018, 15:23 - Paul Dickinson: The snake üêç
08/08/2018, 15:46 - Jack G;: Do we manually choose our players in turn? Just looking at this priority list on the watch list
08/08/2018, 15:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
08/08/2018, 15:47 - Hamish Sinclair: But I think you can set it up incase you arnt there
08/08/2018, 15:47 - Jack G;: üëç
08/08/2018, 15:51 - Paul Dickinson: I‚Äôm going to snake my way straight into your draft plans jack
08/08/2018, 15:52 - Jack G;: Snek
08/08/2018, 16:05 - Phill: I don't get it. Now that I've sorted my list, do I even need to be here for it?
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: Someone could take your pick
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: You have to choose who you want manually
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: That‚Äôs just a watch list
08/08/2018, 16:07 - Phill: Fuck sake
08/08/2018, 16:07 - Phill: What a dick ache
08/08/2018, 16:08 - Jack G;: We‚Äôll need to make our picks quickly too otherwise we‚Äôll be there all night
08/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôll auto draft if you‚Äôre not there but it will take 90 seconds
08/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: So you‚Äôll be a right old cunt
08/08/2018, 16:12 - Phill: Trollin'
08/08/2018, 16:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Is Dave still play8ng?

08/08/2018, 18:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Draft incoming
08/08/2018, 18:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Can everyone join the league?
08/08/2018, 18:45 - Jack G;: Looks like we‚Äôve got 5
08/08/2018, 18:47 - Paul Dickinson: Someone call daffy
08/08/2018, 18:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Thoughts on adding others not on the thread
08/08/2018, 18:50 - Phill: Don't muddy it
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Phill: It's shitty enough already
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Murky
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Paul Dickinson: Slurry FC
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Paul Dickinson: Fuck I‚Äôm nervous. The snake
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Jack G;: üêç
08/08/2018, 18:52 - Phill: Just going to the shop, be back before the draw at 8
08/08/2018, 18:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Arse is twitching
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Paul Dickinson: Assume everyone is drafting from the shitter in anticipation of the nervousness
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: I've got a bucket
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: No mains plug in the shitter
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Jack G;: Hope I don‚Äôt accidentally select a united player
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Rob;: Isn't it at 7?
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Rob;: And in in 3 mins

08/08/2018, 18:56 - Phill: üé£
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Jack G;: Lol
08/08/2018, 18:57 - Jack G;: If I get first pick I‚Äôm taking Salah üëå
08/08/2018, 18:58 - Phill: The autistic choice
08/08/2018, 18:58 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah full autism
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Paul Dickinson: Oh fuck 1min
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Rob;: Tried to use my laptop for this. Booted up an hour ago: installing updates. Current progress: 3%
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Rob;: Phone it is
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Jesus
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Paul Dickinson: So nervous
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Hamish Sinclair: It might start up during this
08/08/2018, 19:00 - Phill: Everyone in draft chat
08/08/2018, 19:00 - Jack G;: Phil
08/08/2018, 19:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Rob
08/08/2018, 19:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you trying to use the full 90seconds
08/08/2018, 19:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Jack you pick again
08/08/2018, 19:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Snake
08/08/2018, 19:04 - Phill: >MAHREZ MAHREZ
08/08/2018, 19:04 - Paul Dickinson: It trolled me. Clicked lukaku
08/08/2018, 19:21 - Rob;: That was so intense
08/08/2018, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh
08/08/2018, 19:21 - Paul Dickinson: I scrolled the player list then it hit me with mahrez
08/08/2018, 19:22 - Hamish Sinclair: I'll trade mahrez with you
08/08/2018, 19:22 - Rob;: It had me down as timed out for my first pick because I hadn't touched the screen for a bit and didn't notify me, then picked Sterling for me
08/08/2018, 19:23 - Paul Dickinson: Mahrez doesn‚Äôt seem so bad anymore. Already got some punters after him
08/08/2018, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh it's ranked all the players based on last year so sterling must have been 3rd
08/08/2018, 19:23 - Rob;: I feel like we didn't quite have enough people, I barely had to make any compromises
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Add in another 5 and it would be intense
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah there would be complete shit floating around everywhere
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Hamish Sinclair: You'd have to really grot around
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Rob;: Yeah, horrid. If you're drawn last you have no hope of a top striker
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes but you could nail two good midfielders
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: By the time it came round to player one again there'd only be some real shit going
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: You'd get first and 20th picl
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Paul Dickinson: Thank god I got jota
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Who is jota
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Rob;: What is Jota?
08/08/2018, 19:26 - Paul Dickinson: That I cannot answer with any degree of certainty
08/08/2018, 19:27 - Paul Dickinson: Got siggurdson then. Time for a comeback
08/08/2018, 20:03 - Paul Dickinson: You‚Äôve jota be kidding me
08/08/2018, 20:28 - David;: I guess this is all over? No way of me picking up the dregs?
08/08/2018, 20:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes you can join and pick up the real shit leftover
08/08/2018, 20:31 - David;: Yeah yeah, how do i do that?
08/08/2018, 20:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Think you just add yourself to the league with the code above
08/08/2018, 20:32 - Paul Dickinson: Get deep in the slurry
08/08/2018, 20:32 - Paul Dickinson: You‚Äôll probably still end up beating jack at least
08/08/2018, 20:37 - Paul Dickinson: Courtois to Real
08/08/2018, 21:16 - David;: Yeah yeah, grot fc.
08/08/2018, 21:20 - Paul Dickinson: Managed to make a team?
08/08/2018, 22:20 - Sam;: Just looking through the Chelsea squad on the PL app...
08/08/2018, 22:20 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
08/08/2018, 22:20 - Sam;: Lol
08/08/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: The Chelsea equivalent of a Diglett Pok√©mon card
08/08/2018, 22:52 - Rob;: Fulham's squad is great on paper
08/08/2018, 22:53 - Rob;: John Micheal Seri, Mitrovic, Sessingon and Andre Shurrle is pretty good for a promoted side
09/08/2018, 00:58 - David;: Says league closed to new entries. Stay.
09/08/2018, 08:01 - Rob;: Me fucken Yurt Julia and I booked for September has burned down
09/08/2018, 08:01 - Rob;: Well, the mountain it's on has
09/08/2018, 08:02 - Rob;: Heatwaves suck
09/08/2018, 08:03 - Phill: I guess yurt have to do something else.
09/08/2018, 08:06 - Rob;: A whopping 14 airbnbs left in Portugal for our dates
09/08/2018, 08:14 - Rob;: The poetry of the lodge's statement is good at least:
09/08/2018, 08:14 - Rob;: I feel  i need to give some information, although it feels very sad to do so. As if by announcing the death of Eco-lodge Brejeira, it turns it really real. But the fact is: it is real. Eco-lodge Brejeira no longer is. It was burnt to ashes in those gigantic fires that are still terrorising the Algarve. The dream that was has come to an end. We, though, are fine. And by some miracle, our own Yurts survived. Some guardian angels protected our home, and i am immensely grateful for that. The hill is in grief, black and sad, and so are we.
But i believe that dreams cannot burn, so new ones will arise from the ashes. For now, though, we are in survival mode, back to the basics. We need to restaure our water, all deposits and pipes were burnt. We need to clean, clean a lot. 
Then, we will see what's next.
For those who wish to, i have written a letter asking for help. If you would like to receive it, send me your email adress and i will send it.
I want to thank everyone who made this dream be what it was in the last eight years. I want to thank everyone who took a little something from our paradise with them, in their hearts. And i wish that Eco-lodge Brejeira will remain alive in many of those hearts.
09/08/2018, 08:15 - Rob;: 'The hill is in grief, black and sad'
09/08/2018, 09:27 - Stefan;: That's pretty shit, hope there are other yurt options available
09/08/2018, 09:27 - Stefan;: Will Eco-Lodge Brejeira remain alive in your heart though?
09/08/2018, 09:28 - Phill: Love the line: we need to clean. Clean a lot.
09/08/2018, 09:28 - Phill: Catastrophic wild fire
09/08/2018, 09:28 - Phill: "get the hoover"

09/08/2018, 10:27 - David;: Someone you would hate to work for
09/08/2018, 10:31 - Jack G;: Looks like we‚Äôre signing all the arsenal rejects. First Wilshere, now Lucas Perez
09/08/2018, 10:50 - Rob;: There's a rich history of that, Wright, Boa Morte, ljungberg
09/08/2018, 10:51 - Rob;: I thought Perez looked good when ever he did play, but apparently he was rather shit when he was loaned back to Deportivo last year
09/08/2018, 10:55 - Sam;: Winterburn, suker
09/08/2018, 10:56 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah, I like what I‚Äôve seen. Good finisher, eye for a pass, can do football

09/08/2018, 12:05 - Sam;: Only if we DONT sign Maguire
09/08/2018, 12:05 - Phill: Why would Maguire take a step backwards?
09/08/2018, 12:07 - Sam;: From 9th to second? Into the UCL?
09/08/2018, 12:08 - Hamish Sinclair: I've heard he doesn't like the look of "the project"
09/08/2018, 12:08 - Hamish Sinclair: The fucking project

09/08/2018, 16:00 - Paul Dickinson: Is this taking over your life?
09/08/2018, 16:00 - Sam;: How has he done this? Is it a publicity stunt?
09/08/2018, 16:01 - Paul Dickinson: Is anyone else aware?
09/08/2018, 16:02 - Sam;: Surely scudamore has been notified
09/08/2018, 16:10 - Jack G;: Spurs still with no signings. Hilarious
09/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: Do they need anyone?
09/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: Could get a miazga
09/08/2018, 16:12 - Jack G;: Back up for Kane, another centre mid probably
09/08/2018, 16:13 - Sam;: 10 available at present
09/08/2018, 16:13 - Jack G;: Loads of their players will have World Cup fatigue

09/08/2018, 16:13 - Jack G;: >Levy

09/08/2018, 16:15 - Paul Dickinson: Kane is able
09/08/2018, 16:15 - Rob;: They're continuing at Wembley until it is ready
09/08/2018, 16:15 - Jack G;: Oh
09/08/2018, 16:15 - Jack G;: Missed that news

10/08/2018, 20:20 - David;: Phil have you played finnish skittles? Great game
11/08/2018, 10:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Mourinho, complaining that Leicester have spent more than him, as if you're only as good as your last transfer wimdow
11/08/2018, 10:45 - David;: Have they even? James maddison, who else?
11/08/2018, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh don't think so. Regardless of this window mourinho has spent net 315m since he took over, second only to city
11/08/2018, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Which doesn't take into account the fact they got ibra and Sanchez on frees with ridiculous wages
11/08/2018, 10:48 - Hamish Sinclair: His interviews are starting to sounds very "alternative facts "
11/08/2018, 17:48 - Sam;: Fuck sake. The wolves keeper is number 11
11/08/2018, 21:28 - David;: Lol Hamish - a grotty schlupp on the bench
11/08/2018, 21:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes quite frustrating
11/08/2018, 21:29 - David;: But fair chance sturridge won't play to bring him on?
11/08/2018, 21:30 - Hamish Sinclair: I reckon he will get a grotty 10 minute cameo
11/08/2018, 21:30 - David;: Probably, now that you need him not to
11/08/2018, 21:31 - David;: Will keita play number 10 role do you think?
11/08/2018, 21:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes I reckon
11/08/2018, 21:32 - David;: If he goes with shaqiri starting he could move deeper and be box to box. But think klopp will use shaq off the bench
12/08/2018, 10:26 - Phill: Tfw Sunday supplement

12/08/2018, 13:01 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm optimistic but at the same time fully expecting to get our arse handed to us
12/08/2018, 13:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Feels like a banana skin this
12/08/2018, 13:04 - Sam;: Team can‚Äôt have gelled that much yet can it
12/08/2018, 13:04 - David;: Actually just 2 new players in the team though? Wilshere and felipe anderson
12/08/2018, 13:05 - David;: Or fredericks as well? But still only 3, not exactly a blank slate
12/08/2018, 13:06 - Paul Dickinson: Sambo, was Pierre le van your best ever bonceball manager player?
12/08/2018, 13:06 - David;: Vasiliev
12/08/2018, 13:09 - Jack G;: Liking our bench tbh, chicharito obiang and Yarmolenko great options
12/08/2018, 13:13 - Jack G;: Is Fabinho injured?
12/08/2018, 13:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
12/08/2018, 13:14 - Hamish Sinclair: As are all our centre backs
12/08/2018, 13:14 - Jack G;: Nice
12/08/2018, 13:15 - Sam;: Valery Vasylev and amady diawara were one and two, then le van

16/08/2018, 23:14 - Paul Dickinson: Sams use of technology stopped in 09 otherwise everything would have got away from him. Plus if the device is out of action then what would you play it on ?

17/08/2018, 08:40 - Sam;: It‚Äôs on my laptop. FM13. FM09 is still the best
17/08/2018, 08:52 - David;: Canyou update 13 to have the squads of now?
17/08/2018, 09:11 - Sam;: Some little screb may have made a patch with 18/19 squads but it would require changing the DOB of every player in the game and creating a shit tonne of players. A shit tonne.
17/08/2018, 09:18 - David;: But imagine rebooting the 09 interface with modern players
17/08/2018, 09:19 - David;: It did add a lot when they added the 3d match view
17/08/2018, 09:19 - David;: The level of immersion
17/08/2018, 09:19 - David;: Fm11 was the best imho
17/08/2018, 09:25 - Sam;: I always preferred the dots because of the birds eye view. Shape, formation, seeing it
17/08/2018, 09:44 - Sam;: When was the interface changes to the modern style FM12 or 13. Is too busy and clunky to move between screens. 

I
17/08/2018, 09:44 - Sam;: 7
17/08/2018, 09:54 - David;: Nah, they made the shift on 11 and it was a bit clunky but they tidied everything up by 12/13. Also that relates to your processing power, and you always had option to switch back to the old interface. If you were mental enough to want that.
17/08/2018, 09:55 - David;: Well done, no sauce.
17/08/2018, 09:56 - David;: So you could play FM13 still using the dots
17/08/2018, 10:05 - David;: just checked my fm13 stats on steam. 1,197 hours. Ah.
17/08/2018, 10:05 - Sam;: Yeah yeah yeah. I played 13 with dots, preferring tactical oversight to graphics. If it‚Äôs not fifa standard then don‚Äôt bother.

Still found 09 to have smother transitions from screen to screen and simpler layouts
17/08/2018, 10:05 - Phill: Can you do FM online league with your mates?
17/08/2018, 10:06 - Phill: Would mitigate against potential gaming abuse as you'd have to wait for your opponent
17/08/2018, 10:06 - Sam;: Yeah think so but it‚Äôs turn based so could take forever
17/08/2018, 10:06 - David;: 09 felt a bit too primitive. I liked the tactics engine of 13 better.
17/08/2018, 10:06 - Phill: Yeah yeah, so you'd be forced to take breaks
17/08/2018, 10:07 - Sam;: It‚Äôs all about ploughing through to the January transfer window, pretending you‚Äôll stop there
17/08/2018, 10:08 - David;: Yeah, but if you are doing well then you need the rush to continue and if it's going badly you have to end on a win.
17/08/2018, 10:08 - David;: So you can never stop
17/08/2018, 12:41 - Paul Dickinson: Sambo, what was your trophy cabinet looking like?

17/08/2018, 20:20 - Sam;: Yeah but Tommy cannon dave..

30/08/2018, 22:28 - / James Ball: We have no light-speed capable rockets. Nothing even remotely close
30/08/2018, 22:30 - / James Ball: Also you can slow light down to the point that it's travelling visible with an ultra high speed camera.
30/08/2018, 22:30 - / James Ball: I realise I'm not Damo. I'm sure he'll have a much more grounded response...

30/08/2018, 23:27 - David;: Didn't Phil mean if you attach a light producing object to something moving forward you should add that forward velocity to the light coming from which. Which is obviously bollocks, but in a different way.

Stay liberal! Retard.
31/08/2018, 06:50 - Phill: Damo your LED poi emits light, and you spin it. What is conservation of momentum. 1-0
31/08/2018, 07:52 - Damian Rumble: It's all too do with reference frames. The speed of light is constant to any object moving at a constant velocity. We may observe a rocket with a laser traveling at speed v, but in the rocket's reference frame it is impossible to tell if it is moving, or it is stationary and the entire universe is moving. In that case the rocket only ever experiences a constant speed of light. Special relativity init

31/08/2018, 10:16 - Rob;: We have 1 spare
31/08/2018, 10:32 - David;: Light has no mass so conservation of momentum irrelevant
31/08/2018, 10:33 - David;: Yes
31/08/2018, 10:34 - Damian Rumble: Also tickets for the 12th
31/08/2018, 10:34 - Damian Rumble: Sorry 11th
31/08/2018, 10:34 - Damian Rumble: Wednesday

31/08/2018, 12:35 - Rob;: The volume is astounding
31/08/2018, 12:52 - David;: Causes?
31/08/2018, 12:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Chickpea curry ?
31/08/2018, 12:54 - Hamish Sinclair: I've read that the outer layer of a chickpea causes extreme flatulence  but it's broken down when soaked in water or tinned. Would be good to arrange a trial of tinned vs untinned and document resukts
31/08/2018, 12:55 - David;: So it would need to be completely dry to cause the flatulence?
31/08/2018, 12:55 - Hamish Sinclair: No you apparently just immediately cook them from dry, no soaking
31/08/2018, 12:56 - Hamish Sinclair: When you cook dry pulses you're meant to soak them for 24 hours prior to cooking
31/08/2018, 12:56 - Hamish Sinclair: But that's what they want you to do
31/08/2018, 12:56 - David;: Yeah yeah, that would go badly
31/08/2018, 12:57 - David;: Is it only to deal with the flatulencene though? I heard if you dont soak kidney beans they are poisonous or something
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Hamish Sinclair: My knowledge of this subject begins and ends with chickpeas
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: Yeah the NHS recommends to wash all tinned pulses before eating to avoid getting huge flatulence
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Lol public health England are involved
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: I've heard that about dry kidney beans too
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: But who's buying dried pulses that need days of soaking anyway?
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Other than Judith I've nonidea
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Paul Dickinson: But we want huge flatulence
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: My shits have been caused by a root vegetable Madras and 5 pints
31/08/2018, 13:01 - Sam;: Pints win prizes (shits)
31/08/2018, 13:01 - David;: Who are they to tell me i can't shart everywhere as much as i want? The nanny state
31/08/2018, 13:01 - Paul Dickinson: Root vegetable madras
31/08/2018, 13:02 - David;: This is why we brexited, to take back control of our arses. Fucking eurocrats tinning our british pulses.

31/08/2018, 14:11 - David;: Yeah, very grotty. Always worth revisiting. 'He drew saville as a hounds'
31/08/2018, 14:11 - David;: Broadway 1972, the incredible breakout tour
31/08/2018, 14:17 - Paul Dickinson: Is there anything more grotty than drawing your friend as a hound and giving it as a gift?
31/08/2018, 14:18 - David;: Doing it while also pedoing?
31/08/2018, 14:20 - Paul Dickinson: But it assumes pedo
31/08/2018, 14:20 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôs like a damning insult to be drawn as a hound
31/08/2018, 14:21 - David;: Did the hound picture not cause anyone to suspect anything?
31/08/2018, 14:21 - David;: Just passed off as your everyday hound picture, nothing that it could be implying
31/08/2018, 14:22 - Paul Dickinson: Just your typical human-hound sketch

02/09/2018, 00:44 - / James Ball: Somehow ended up reading about rationing on Wikipedia
02/09/2018, 00:44 - / James Ball: Got to this:
02/09/2018, 00:44 - / James Ball: The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months; the only negative results were the increased time needed for meals to consume the necessary calories from bread and potatoes, and what they described as a "remarkable" increase in flatulence from the large amount of starch in the diet. The scientists also noted that their faeces had increased by 250% in volume.
02/09/2018, 00:47 - Paul Dickinson: >250%
02/09/2018, 00:47 - Paul Dickinson: Read that as faces to begin with

05/09/2018, 13:42 - Phill: Lol was reading about that this morning
05/09/2018, 13:43 - Phill: Apparently he takes sleeping pills then just wakes up in the middle of the night and starts tweeting
05/09/2018, 13:43 - Phill: Like rob when he sleep walks
05/09/2018, 13:43 - Phill: Hence the taking Tesla private bullshit too
05/09/2018, 13:43 - Phill: Probably thought he was dreaming

06/09/2018, 09:24 - Sam;: Are the health benefits of essential oils bullshit or is there something to it?
06/09/2018, 09:28 - Rob;: They're not essential in the sense that your body needs them and can't synthesise them, like essential amino acids
06/09/2018, 09:29 - Rob;: It means they're oil that contain the characteristic ingredient they're named for - eh frankensense
06/09/2018, 09:39 - Sam;: Guessing there‚Äôs some Latin going on in this - lavender and eucalyptus don‚Äôt tell my bonce much as names.

Shame I‚Äôm not called frank, I could do with some sense
06/09/2018, 09:43 - Rob;: Unless you're a koala I don't reckon you really need much eucalyptus
06/09/2018, 09:50 - Sam;: Lol, cool. I mostly want some plant based assistance with oxygenating the flat when it‚Äôs too cold to open the windows. The misses has developed that conversation into a dire need for essential oils.
06/09/2018, 09:52 - Rob;: Oh I see, not consuming them. Actually can they even be consumed?
06/09/2018, 09:52 - Rob;: Why not just get plants?
06/09/2018, 09:56 - Sam;: Yeah I just want dem little ones that don‚Äôt shed leaves and barely need watering
06/09/2018, 09:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Oxygenated the flat - is this to cover for your terrible arse
06/09/2018, 09:59 - Sam;: Is there a plant that feeds on methane? I want that
06/09/2018, 10:00 - Rob;: Get air plants. They die if you do water them
06/09/2018, 11:21 - David;: Oxygen gets in through windows. I've been breathing fine with windiws shut for years
06/09/2018, 11:22 - Rob;: Yeah but Sam's turning it into Co2 and methane quicker than it can get in
06/09/2018, 11:22 - David;: Sure. But no plant is going to cut through that
06/09/2018, 11:23 - David;: He's way beyond a couple of ferns in the corner
06/09/2018, 11:23 - David;: Nah but Fay has the same stupid thing with aromatic oils in baths etc. Think you just have to let them have that.
06/09/2018, 11:25 - Rob;: Something to mask the shit is a good idea I think
06/09/2018, 11:31 - Sam;: She‚Äôs been convinced that the smells of each oil can reduce stress or anxiety and other effects. Happy to have nice smells I guess
06/09/2018, 11:32 - Phill: Just become a weed addict. Smells good and you'll definitely feel less stressed. Everyones a winner.
06/09/2018, 12:05 - Rob;: I mean if she believes it the placebo effect will probably help it work
06/09/2018, 12:05 - Rob;: As long as you're not spending most of your income on essential oils
06/09/2018, 12:05 - Rob;: No Christmas dinner this year, just more oil
06/09/2018, 12:06 - Sam;: Lol. Quite the wrong oil boom
06/09/2018, 12:33 - David;: Peak essential oil
06/09/2018, 12:33 - David;: Brent crude eucalyptus
06/09/2018, 14:39 - Sam;: Can‚Äôt wait for the biopic of Trump, so hard to not make it seem like a parody
06/09/2018, 14:39 - Rob;: I've been thinking this
06/09/2018, 14:40 - Rob;: Will be worth any negative affect on the environment or international affairs
06/09/2018, 16:33 - David;: When is that coming out?
06/09/2018, 16:34 - Rob;: I think Sam meant there will inevitably be one, rather than meaning a specific one on its way
06/09/2018, 16:43 - Sam;: You could make several. I need a lord of the ring style trilogy
06/09/2018, 19:57 - David;: I'm already annoyed with this international break and we haven't even played.

08/09/2018, 18:46 - David;: Rules for the interaction between nations league and euros qualificatios are so complicated
08/09/2018, 19:04 - Damian Rumble: I thought I read somewhere that the winners of each division get automatic qualification. That means Gibraltar could get in by winning the shit munching division
08/09/2018, 19:50 - David;: It means there will always be at least one shitmuncher
08/09/2018, 19:51 - Damian Rumble: And we'll definitely manage to lose to them ...

08/09/2018, 21:05 - David;: That's the real referendum.
08/09/2018, 21:05 - Damian Rumble: Maybe a slight edge to the union
08/09/2018, 21:06 - David;: May won't be able to ignore that sort of popular resistance for long
08/09/2018, 21:08 - Phill: Hope those waving union jack's are walking the walk and drinking English sparkling wine.
08/09/2018, 21:21 - David;: Surepy this vintage of british wine is going to be great because of the weather?
08/09/2018, 21:32 - Damian Rumble: It would be if we had the labour to pick it. If only we hadn't given a massive fuck you to those who wanted to come to do those jobs rather relying on our own lazy work shy fuck whits who won't.

10/09/2018, 17:54 - Stefan;: Lol, imagine being the journalist whose editor told them to write this
10/09/2018, 17:56 - Stefan;: "Gases can either be reabsorbed through the gut wall into the circulation and eventually exhaled through the lungs or excreted via the rectum, as a fart."
So it dissolves in your blood, it doesn't literally come out of your mouth in its pure fart form
10/09/2018, 17:56 - Phill: In a 24-hour period all the flatus they expelled was collected via a rectal catheter.
10/09/2018, 17:58 - Stefan;: Why weren't we invited to take part in these experiments?
10/09/2018, 21:49 - David;: Would be a good wales activity
10/09/2018, 21:50 - David;: Rob. Biology. Does light from normal artificial lightbulbs help plants in any way? I.e. will moving them to a room where the lights are on more often in the evening have any impact?
10/09/2018, 22:16 - Rob;: Yeah it does
10/09/2018, 22:16 - Rob;: You can grow plants via electronic lights
10/09/2018, 22:18 - Rob;: But sunlight is best, as they're adapted to that spectrum. But if it's the same amount of sunlight + extra electric light it might help them
10/09/2018, 22:19 - Rob;: Will vary for variegated plants, which are adapted to low level light anyway

20/09/2018, 15:46 - Rob;: Sam redo your phone advert with a banana in shot
20/09/2018, 15:48 - / James Ball: Banana for scale is a meme. Maybe you should list a banana with a banana for scale
20/09/2018, 15:58 - Sam;: I just realised he‚Äôs done another photo with a can of soup for scale as well. I hope he really though about which two items are best for showing scale. Ruler? Nah too obvious

25/09/2018, 19:25 - Sam;: Sovereignty‚Äôs coming home..
25/09/2018, 19:27 - Phill: I voted remain last time. If there was another I'd vote leave just because I'm sick of it.
25/09/2018, 19:50 - Rob;: But it would be over much more quickly if everyone voted remain in a second referendum
25/09/2018, 19:51 - Jack G;: All the baby boomers would be out rioting in the streets, would be a great sight
25/09/2018, 19:58 - / James Ball: well, about a third of the baby boomers
25/09/2018, 20:01 - Phill: I'm sorry but we can't just keep having votes. There would be a huge campaign for another vote if remain won the second time round by leave. Respect the referendum. Respect the result. You liberal cunt.
25/09/2018, 20:02 - Jack G;: >more voting being less democratic
25/09/2018, 20:05 - Phill: >tfw when you realise that another vote is a "your opinion means nothing" to 52% of the population

25/09/2018, 20:18 - Sam;: Yeah but they didn‚Äôt get a second. Until the eu was a far different thing. (If you‚Äôre talking about those who opposed joining in the first place)
25/09/2018, 20:23 - Jack G;: Can‚Äôt wait to be America‚Äôs bitch once we hard brexit
25/09/2018, 20:24 - Rob;: I think it's very unlikely that the deal we get, if we get one, will look anything like what the 52% wanted, therefore it's fair to ask them if they still want it
25/09/2018, 20:27 - Hamish Sinclair: If it's still the will of the people then they'll just vote for it a second time?
25/09/2018, 20:27 - / James Ball: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that brexit is going to be quite unsatisfying for everyone involved
25/09/2018, 20:28 - Jack G;: David Cameron is somewhere, laughing with his cock in a pigs anus
25/09/2018, 20:28 - Sam;: I‚Äôll take unsatisfying James. It‚Äôs the catastrophe their predicting I‚Äôm worried about

29/09/2018, 14:47 - Jack G;: Offside, deflection, foul in build up
29/09/2018, 14:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Except in this case it does, cos it doesn't include the millions spent on ibra and sanchez
29/09/2018, 14:47 - Jack G;: All fake goals apparently
29/09/2018, 14:47 - David;: And purchase of Pogba pre-Neymar. So inflation adjust that as well
29/09/2018, 14:48 - Jack G;: Would have to give Mourinho a huge payout to sack as well
29/09/2018, 14:52 - David;: Yeah but they probably recoup it by floging pogba emojis to the indonesian market
29/09/2018, 16:48 - Jack G;: 2-0 seems like the score of the day
29/09/2018, 16:48 - Jack G;: Clearly a dangerous score line
29/09/2018, 17:08 - Damian Rumble: Big match coming up
29/09/2018, 18:59 - Damian Rumble: Chelsea putting on a master class in defence here

01/10/2018, 19:07 - Rob;: Doing it tonight in fact
01/10/2018, 19:12 - Stefan;: Making a group? Is there space for me if so?
01/10/2018, 19:14 - Rob;: Yeah, makings Facebook thread where people can post their registration details. It'll be a mix of pipeline I know who want to go with the idea being that if you get through and have space in your six, you buy a ticket for someone else. And keep trying after you have a ticket
01/10/2018, 19:16 - Stefan;: Sounds good

01/10/2018, 20:20 - Phill: I can feel the autism exploding out of the TV
01/10/2018, 20:20 - Rob;: I had to turn over
01/10/2018, 20:24 - Phill: It's bad that the BBC is using autism to make money
01/10/2018, 20:24 - Phill: Might tweet my distaste
03/10/2018, 12:52 - Damian Rumble: Go and watch the first couple of minutes of Teresa May's conference speech. It's GOLD

08/10/2018, 09:52 - Sam;: What was the joke with football club names. Was it stuff like dynamo Bethlehem?
08/10/2018, 19:49 - Rob;: I think it stemmed from MK Homs
08/10/2018, 19:49 - Rob;: West Bank Albion etc
10/10/2018, 21:21 - Rob;: Four Tet planets isn't a song it's a lifestyle

12/10/2018, 13:11 - Paul Dickinson: Who‚Äôs he playing for?
12/10/2018, 13:20 - Sam;: Australian team
12/10/2018, 15:47 - Sam;: Yeah just give Susan Coleslaw a call mate
12/10/2018, 15:47 - Paul Dickinson: Hugo McGlue
12/10/2018, 20:15 - David;: This game
12/10/2018, 20:20 - Sam;: Commentators describing what they can see outside the stadium... the harbour, the beach, it‚Äôs a lovely country..
13/10/2018, 10:32 - David;: So Tony was at a country club outside Cardiff for work this week. The wales team was staying there. Apparently he was sitting about 2 metres from Gareth Bale talking to Ramsey about Madrid's form. Slagging off Modric, saying it is because he is too slow. Then Giggsy walked in.
13/10/2018, 10:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Is Ramsey signing for  liverpool?
13/10/2018, 10:39 - David;: He didn't manage to glean that information
13/10/2018, 10:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Blaming it all on the champions league winning, world cup finalist
13/10/2018, 10:41 - Hamish Sinclair: What about selling Ronaldo Gareth?
13/10/2018, 10:41 - David;: "Too slow"
13/10/2018, 10:47 - Rob;: FIFA player of the year
15/10/2018, 19:35 - David;: Jesus - our midfield
15/10/2018, 19:35 - David;: Winks, Barkley, Dier. Ah
15/10/2018, 20:19 - Sam;: Well butter my balls
15/10/2018, 20:19 - David;: 'If you just search daylight robbery'
15/10/2018, 20:23 - Sam;: I think there‚Äôs been a rape up there
15/10/2018, 20:23 - David;: I'm mainly glad that cunt Ramos is having egg smeared all over his smuh little face
15/10/2018, 20:24 - David;: Ah. Ah. Ah. Yeah.
15/10/2018, 20:24 - David;: 3-0
15/10/2018, 20:24 - Paul Dickinson: What is this nations league?
15/10/2018, 20:25 - Paul Dickinson: Dangerous scoreline surely
15/10/2018, 20:25 - David;: Nah we've gone past the danger. Risk free at 3-0
15/10/2018, 20:27 - Rob;: So do we play Croatia one more time then that's  it for the group stage bit?
15/10/2018, 20:27 - Sam;: Yeah
15/10/2018, 20:27 - Rob;: Seems like 4 in a group might be more fun
15/10/2018, 20:30 - Sam;: Yeah three is strange. Must be forced by the number of inty breaks they have to work with
15/10/2018, 20:30 - David;: There are some 4 team groups
15/10/2018, 20:30 - Sam;: Rekt
15/10/2018, 20:30 - David;: But not even numbers because has to divide up all countries
15/10/2018, 20:33 - David;: I mean it's a mess
15/10/2018, 20:34 - Rob;: 4 wouldn't need more breaks necessarily - for example Croatia could be playing the other team tonight, and we could have played them when Croatia were playing Spain instead of having that friendly
15/10/2018, 20:54 - Phill: >tfw when you smoke a big Billy bifta and get immersed in Pillars of Eternity, completely forgetting the England game before checking the score at half time
15/10/2018, 20:56 - Phill: <Media omitted>

15/10/2018, 21:05 - David;: What's your gig on pillars?
15/10/2018, 21:09 - Phill: Only one of the best CRPG's ever made.
15/10/2018, 21:10 - Phill: Fancied another playthrough, started again over the weekend.
15/10/2018, 21:11 - Phill: Currently a wizard with another wizard, a priest and a fucking shiity chanter in my party. Scouting an abandoned estate for some cunt called Maerwald
15/10/2018, 21:11 - David;: 'A fucking shitty chanter'
15/10/2018, 21:13 - Phill: Just stands there singing chants to give my party buffs.
15/10/2018, 21:14 - Phill: In combat
15/10/2018, 21:14 - Phill: What a cunt
15/10/2018, 21:17 - Paul Dickinson: This nations league is a pretty good idea? Not sure how I missed it
15/10/2018, 21:18 - David;: Yeah big, has got rid of the meaningless friendlies
15/10/2018, 21:19 - Paul Dickinson: Always something to play for now
15/10/2018, 21:37 - David;: Pickford looks like a gurning raver you would see at 6am in shangri-la - always playing on 10 cans of lager and 100mg of mdma
15/10/2018, 22:30 - Damian Rumble: I saw this on the BBC and thought you should see it:

Woman paralysed after being 'catapulted' off bed during sex - http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-berkshire-45868183
15/10/2018, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: Stefan presumably the court needs to hear all the details in this case right? Maybe with some reinactments
15/10/2018, 22:35 - Rob;: Stopped being funny when the word paralysed appears
15/10/2018, 22:59 - Stefan;: Sounds like you're volunteering Damo
16/10/2018, 20:44 - David;: Anyone watching bake off?
16/10/2018, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Is it on now?
16/10/2018, 20:45 - David;: Yeah, quarters
16/10/2018, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Quaters. That's got to be in-tents
16/10/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: *quarters
16/10/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: I watch the first few rounds. Is the fit one still in?
16/10/2018, 20:46 - David;: Yeah ruby. Would bang.
16/10/2018, 20:52 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/10/2018, 20:53 - David;: ???
16/10/2018, 20:53 - Paul Dickinson: Terrible picture
16/10/2018, 20:53 - Paul Dickinson: Can‚Äôt tell if fit or not
16/10/2018, 20:56 - David;: She is fit but that's a retarded picture
16/10/2018, 20:58 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/10/2018, 20:58 - Damian Rumble: Better
16/10/2018, 20:59 - Paul Dickinson: If I‚Äôm not seeing raw gusset how am I meant to tell
16/10/2018, 21:01 - David;: Bake off not know for gusset shots
16/10/2018, 21:02 - Paul Dickinson: Not famed for exposing perenium
16/10/2018, 21:02 - David;: Never been its USP
16/10/2018, 22:15 - Damian Rumble: Went back and watched the whole of GBBO on catch up. To be fair the fit one smashed it out the park. Hollywood on top form. Describing people's baking as 'awful' to their face. Making them cry. Then rounding it off with an unsubtle dig at the Rahul to 'up it next' after he spent the entire show having a mental breakdown due to stress. Delicious.

17/10/2018, 00:07 - Damian Rumble: Out this week. Massive controversy
17/10/2018, 00:07 - David;: Ah well. Ruining that episode for him
17/10/2018, 00:08 - Rob;: Yeah thanks mate
17/10/2018, 00:08 - Damian Rumble: I'm sure you'll get over it
17/10/2018, 00:08 - David;: She was fit but almost too French
17/10/2018, 00:11 - Rob;: Too French is a difficult concept for me
17/10/2018, 00:11 - Rob;: And the baking, it's an attractive trait
17/10/2018, 00:12 - Rob;: Naughty punk hair
17/10/2018, 00:12 - Rob;: So naughty
17/10/2018, 00:12 - Rob;: *pink

17/10/2018, 12:00 - David;: Grotty in a good way?
17/10/2018, 12:02 - Rob;: Definitely a good way
17/10/2018, 12:02 - David;: She's cheeky
17/10/2018, 12:03 - David;: She's got a turn
17/10/2018, 12:05 - David;: But looks a bit like a fish
17/10/2018, 12:07 - Rob;: I think if you met her in a real life context you'd be enamoured
17/10/2018, 12:11 - Damian Rumble: Not for me. No edge
17/10/2018, 12:20 - Rob;: But the turn
17/10/2018, 12:20 - Rob;: The cheeky turn

18/10/2018, 07:30 - Rob;: The layout was mental. We were just behind that bit to the right
18/10/2018, 08:05 - Damian Rumble: I figured it is to be where Orchestra sat back in the day
18/10/2018, 08:06 - Damian Rumble: Carpet every where
18/10/2018, 08:06 - Damian Rumble: I was think of going to a Psy night there in November. That would be extra weird
19/10/2018, 14:29 - Damian Rumble: Phil how do you feel about clegg going to Facebook?
19/10/2018, 14:58 - David;: Strange decision. Trying to repair a lack of trust in a young user base for using their data to manipulate the electoral process. Hire a man best known for breaking an electoral promise to young voters.
19/10/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: Nick Clegg's brother is Julia's CEO
19/10/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: Fun fact for you
19/10/2018, 15:06 - Rob;: Paul Clegg
20/10/2018, 12:29 - David;: This is going to be a classic mourinho 0-0 surely?
20/10/2018, 12:30 - Sam;: Dunno, pretty attacking line up
20/10/2018, 12:31 - Sam;: Don‚Äôt think he expects to keep a clean sheet so trying to a get a goal
20/10/2018, 12:37 - Rob;: I want a classic 0-0
20/10/2018, 12:52 - David;: That's set it up nicely
20/10/2018, 12:54 - David;: I've got the tv muted ajd synched up the radio commentary. Game changer - makes it much more intense
20/10/2018, 12:55 - David;: All football should be consumed this way
20/10/2018, 13:07 - Rob;: 6 Music Celebrates The White Album - With Martin Freeman - @bbc6music http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0000q41
20/10/2018, 13:08 - Rob;: Three hours of Martin Freeman analysing the White Album track by track
20/10/2018, 13:09 - David;: Lol, why Martin Freeman? But i wilk be listening to thay
20/10/2018, 13:11 - Rob;: He does lots of specials for 6 music and is a Beatles nut
20/10/2018, 13:12 - David;: Glass Onion - tune
20/10/2018, 13:42 - Sam;: A mild relief from butt hurt
20/10/2018, 13:46 - David;: Martialiol - provides temporary relief from chronic butt hurt. Ask your manager to prescribe it today.
20/10/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: A double dose!
20/10/2018, 14:11 - David;: Best to sub that
20/10/2018, 14:11 - David;: Rubbish
20/10/2018, 14:12 - Sam;: He‚Äôs done his job
20/10/2018, 14:12 - David;: On a hat-trick. That's so clasically mourinho
20/10/2018, 14:13 - Sam;: Don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll be pushing for a third..
20/10/2018, 14:14 - David;: But he's fired up as well, confidence flowing. Let him have his 10 little minutes
20/10/2018, 14:21 - Sam;: I decide in two minutes
20/10/2018, 14:23 - Sam;: Fuck sake
20/10/2018, 14:24 - David;: Crufts
20/10/2018, 14:24 - David;: That's what happens. The negative psychological message of the martial sub
20/10/2018, 15:21 - David;: Ah Hamish - the unorthodox captaining of Wilson.
20/10/2018, 22:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Neil Warnock -  "we played some good stuff today" as if he's not in charge of it
20/10/2018, 22:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Backfired massively
20/10/2018, 22:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Live and die by those decisions
22/10/2018, 10:07 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
22/10/2018, 14:42 - David;: Just researching the Warnock team's from the era of the swearing video. The guy he is shouting at about marking is Chris Morgan. He got sent of 12 times in his career. At both the clubs he was at he holds the red card record.
22/10/2018, 14:43 - David;: "On 8 November 2008, during a 2‚Äì1 defeat at former club Barnsley, Morgan elbowed Iain Hume as he was waiting for an aerial ball, and Hume suffered a fractured skull as a result whilst Morgan received only a yellow card. Hume underwent emergency surgery and spent 48 hours in the high-dependency unit of a Manchester hospital with life-threatening injuries."
22/10/2018, 14:44 - Sam;: Just letting him know he‚Äôs there
22/10/2018, 14:45 - Paul Dickinson: Just seen the picture of that injury
22/10/2018, 14:45 - Paul Dickinson: Half his skull looks to have been reattached after
22/10/2018, 14:45 - Paul Dickinson: Fair challenge
22/10/2018, 14:46 - David;: Just a booking
22/10/2018, 17:32 - Phill: Spent the weekend getting high as fuck and gardening. Drank a bottle of pinot.

22/10/2018, 17:49 - Phill: Dave did you ever try Clos du Bois in California?
22/10/2018, 21:38 - David;: Nope - a napa valley pinot?
22/10/2018, 21:39 - David;: That Ozil goal
22/10/2018, 22:28 - Rob;: The aubemeyang one might be better - great team move
23/10/2018, 12:04 - David;: Stefan I'm going to take that Max Richter song off the playlist not because it isn't good but it was already put on like 2 or 3 playlists back.
23/10/2018, 12:51 - Stefan;: Fair enough
23/10/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: I had the Robyn song on a few times last night
23/10/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: Early scope
23/10/2018, 13:13 - David;: Cunningham?
23/10/2018, 19:04 - David;: Bit of a match on tonight then Sambo
23/10/2018, 19:04 - David;: A game of football if you will
23/10/2018, 19:05 - Sam;: Yeah. Secret weapon on the bench.  Chong
23/10/2018, 19:06 - David;: He's got that all Chong
23/10/2018, 19:06 - David;: A really Chong bench tonight
23/10/2018, 19:07 - David;: Must be better than Sanchez then?
23/10/2018, 19:07 - Sam;: Another reason there was no point signing Sanchez. Had Chong there ready to come into the first team. He plays right wing
23/10/2018, 19:08 - David;: Must be making some obscure trolly point about Sanchez's attitude?
23/10/2018, 19:09 - Sam;: He was injured for Chelsea. Thinks he‚Äôs still butt hurt from the injury
23/10/2018, 19:10 - David;: Juventus - great team all the way through and then you see Szczesny in goal.
23/10/2018, 19:10 - David;: Can not even on the bench. Makes his decision to leave even more embarassing for him
23/10/2018, 19:10 - Sam;: Yeah
23/10/2018, 19:10 - Damian Rumble: Thoughts on a proper club world cup sambo?

Fifa set to revive controversial plans for new Club World Cup and Nations League - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/45957030
23/10/2018, 19:10 - David;: Oh actually looks like he's injured as well
23/10/2018, 19:11 - Damian Rumble: Looks like Saudi Arabia is in ...
23/10/2018, 19:16 - Rob;: I think Szcsesny has apparently stepped up pretty well
23/10/2018, 19:32 - Sam;: Not interested. It‚Äôll be shit. Where in the season will they play it
23/10/2018, 20:22 - David;: Fucking hell lindelof's distribution
23/10/2018, 20:22 - David;: Gives it away every time
23/10/2018, 20:25 - Sam;: Getting absolutely dominated here. 28% possession
23/10/2018, 20:28 - David;: How deep the press is is crazy
23/10/2018, 20:28 - David;: At home
23/10/2018, 20:29 - David;: Only press about 15 yards behind the half way line
23/10/2018, 20:29 - Sam;: Only got counter attack to deploy though
23/10/2018, 20:31 - David;: Yeah but effective counter means winning the ball in dangerous open situations
23/10/2018, 20:32 - David;: And actually pressing with intensity to force mistakes
23/10/2018, 20:40 - Rob;: Save
23/10/2018, 21:13 - David;: Lukaku needs a long time to make a decision
23/10/2018, 21:14 - David;: A real procrastinator
23/10/2018, 21:14 - Sam;: Yeah, a bit of a donkey on the ball
23/10/2018, 21:14 - Sam;: Can only do explosive stuff
23/10/2018, 21:14 - Sam;: Or strength
23/10/2018, 21:15 - Sam;: Blastoise
23/10/2018, 21:15 - David;: Was he like that at everton? Rember him running with the ball a lot more
23/10/2018, 21:18 - Sam;: Yeah but they have to do more defending so get more chances to play on they break. Suits a running beast
23/10/2018, 21:20 - David;: True - should suit him here with you playing on counter.
23/10/2018, 21:35 - David;: Postba
23/10/2018, 21:36 - Rob;: No chance that would have stayed out if Szcesney was playing for Arsneal

24/10/2018, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: My housemate just arrived back from work and immediately disappeared in to the toilet for half an hour. We were out of paper so he had bought some new supplies on the way home and i later noted that this one session has used somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of a roll. I feel like this is a little excessive...
24/10/2018, 21:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you calling a big shit or a massive wank?
24/10/2018, 21:39 - Damian Rumble: I mean... I don't really see the notice for the latter but the evidence is irrefutable

25/10/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: Reading about River Phoenix's death:
25/10/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: According to the 2013 book, Running with Monsters, by Phoenix‚Äôs friend Bob Forrest, Phoenix had spent the previous days on a massive drugs binge with Red Hot Chili Peppers‚Äô guitarist, John Frusciante: ‚Äú[River] stayed with John for the next few days, and probably didn‚Äôt get a minute of sleep. The drug routine stayed pretty consistent for all of us. First, smoke crack or shoot coke directly into a vein for that 90-second, electric brain-bell jangle. Then shoot heroin to get a grip and come down enough to be able to carry on a conversation for a few minutes before you start the cycle again,‚Äù Forrest wrote.
25/10/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: >shooting heroin to get a grip
25/10/2018, 10:52 - David;: Lol, that's you sobering up and getting a handle on things

26/10/2018, 00:55 - David;: Good Tony moment. Up in ByC. A card game is being explained. He quietly pulls down his sleeve during the explanation, hold it up and says 'look i've won - i've got rid of my hand'. Loving the little pun, rest of the family looking withering.
26/10/2018, 09:43 - Sam;: Still got it
26/10/2018, 09:45 - Rob;: Why have a family of not so you can do that?
26/10/2018, 10:47 - Damian Rumble: I'm at our Norwich office today and the random person I just sat down next to is having a very detailed telephone meeting about the need to stockpile resources in the event of a hard brexit. This shit just got real...
26/10/2018, 10:48 - Rob;: What resources should we be worried about?
26/10/2018, 10:49 - Phill: Tampons
26/10/2018, 10:49 - Phill: For all the liberal bleeding that's going to happen
26/10/2018, 10:50 - Rob;: >liberal
26/10/2018, 10:50 - Damian Rumble: it's labour resources.
26/10/2018, 10:52 - Phill: So you want to stockpile low wage foreign workers?
26/10/2018, 10:54 - Damian Rumble: No if there's a no deal then we won't be able recruit highly skilled workers
26/10/2018, 10:55 - Phill: Why not?
26/10/2018, 11:01 - Sam;: No free movement. Need working visa for Hungarian developer
26/10/2018, 11:01 - Sam;: Zlatko
26/10/2018, 11:01 - Sam;: And brother Bogdan
26/10/2018, 11:02 - Rob;: No Visa for little Pavel to pedal his A-grade UX design
26/10/2018, 11:03 - Phill: If you're skilled, and we need you, you'll get a visa.
26/10/2018, 11:04 - Phill: This is remoaner propaganda. Don't buy into it.
26/10/2018, 11:05 - Rob;: But if you're little Zlatko and you you work in France or Germany without having the hassle of getting a visa you would probably just do that
26/10/2018, 11:08 - Phill: MUH skilled foreign labour market. Just up-skill the British labour force instead. Problem solved.
26/10/2018, 11:10 - Phill: Don't need fuckin Zlatko
26/10/2018, 11:10 - Phill: Brian will do just fine
26/10/2018, 11:12 - Stefan;: The skilled visa system is awful. The numbers are capped, it's massively expensive for the employer and worker, and the system is deliberately hostile
26/10/2018, 11:12 - Stefan;: Bennett is on a visa and it's shit
26/10/2018, 11:13 - Stefan;: We've been trying for decades to close the skills gap and it hasn't worked
26/10/2018, 11:14 - Phill: So just say fuck it let Pj√∂tr and SMINEM fill the gap?
26/10/2018, 11:15 - Phill: Investment and better access to more technical skills is what is needed, not free movement of foreign labour.
26/10/2018, 11:16 - Sam;: Free movement gave us access to technical skills. They just weren‚Äôt English

26/10/2018, 11:47 - Stefan;: Don't feed the trolls Damo
26/10/2018, 11:48 - Damian Rumble: I preferring to think of it as poking the trolls...

26/10/2018, 13:36 - Stefan;: But I can still picture myself scrutinising these in an employment tribunal
26/10/2018, 13:38 - Rob;: There's no background
26/10/2018, 13:38 - David;: How much thought did you out into mapping the personalities to the kitchen objects?
26/10/2018, 13:38 - David;: I've never imagined pepper as feeling insecure
26/10/2018, 13:39 - David;: It's confident, sucessful - it's position as the master seasoning is under no threat surely?
26/10/2018, 13:39 - Rob;: I wanted it to be slightly incongruous
26/10/2018, 13:40 - Rob;: So there's an underlying weirdness in the idea of an aubergine being an architect for example
26/10/2018, 13:41 - Paul Dickinson: Yes I had no idea what was going on
26/10/2018, 13:42 - Paul Dickinson: I assumed it was people you‚Äôd overheard in the office then gave them a vegetable persona. Until I realized you don‚Äôt work with architects. Then it got more unsettling
26/10/2018, 13:42 - Sam;: You always been the caretaker Paul
26/10/2018, 13:42 - David;: That checks out to me - aubergine. Flowery, hipster, into design.

27/10/2018, 10:19 - Rob;: But that 'pedestrianised' bit outside where all the buses try to kill you
27/10/2018, 12:51 - Damian Rumble: Fun fact. When I did year 10 work experience I 'worked' on the designs for the new Westgate centre
27/10/2018, 12:51 - Rob;: Would be funny if there's some fundamental error that can be traced back to you

28/10/2018, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: Mustafi = shit
28/10/2018, 15:32 - Sam;: So ElevenSports have got the rights to la liga and serie A. Just downloaded the app and they put all the match highlights on there for free..
28/10/2018, 15:33 - David;: Not live games though?
28/10/2018, 15:36 - Sam;: Nah
28/10/2018, 15:37 - Sam;: It‚Äôs only 5.99 per month or 60 for the year
28/10/2018, 15:37 - Sam;: But if I can just watch the highlights free I will
28/10/2018, 15:39 - Sam;: Ah hold on. The highlights are only free about a week after the match
28/10/2018, 15:40 - David;: Fail Madrid
28/10/2018, 15:47 - Sam;: Oh dear. Can loputegui survive this?
28/10/2018, 15:47 - David;: No
28/10/2018, 15:47 - David;: Think he's already gone just need to get a replacement lined up
28/10/2018, 15:48 - David;: Modric too slow
28/10/2018, 15:49 - David;: It's fun watching sergio ramos' world collapsing
28/10/2018, 16:02 - Sam;: He can‚Äôt foul his way out of this one
28/10/2018, 16:27 - David;: That fucking dive
28/10/2018, 16:27 - David;: Disgrace
28/10/2018, 16:29 - David;: Pogba also embarassing himself.
28/10/2018, 16:36 - Sam;: Not a dive. Silly challenge same as xhaka on zaha earlier
28/10/2018, 16:36 - Sam;: Foul anywhere on the pitch
28/10/2018, 16:36 - David;: Got the ball
28/10/2018, 16:37 - Sam;: Nah
28/10/2018, 16:37 - David;: Massive double movement, reacts in unatural way
28/10/2018, 16:37 - David;: He does, foot gets the ball
28/10/2018, 16:37 - Sam;: Took martial out by sticking his leg into his stride
28/10/2018, 16:37 - David;: Then he realises he's lost it so hurls himself to ground
28/10/2018, 16:38 - David;: Look at his movement it's such a clear dive
28/10/2018, 16:38 - Sam;: Well yeah he makes the point but the foul is already committed at that point
28/10/2018, 16:39 - David;: Should get booked for the simulation whatever happens. And the  he gets the ball so also not a pen
28/10/2018, 16:43 - Sam;: It‚Äôs not binary. You can get a touch on the ball and foul
28/10/2018, 16:44 - David;: But if the ball is there to be won and you win it and take some of thean at the same time that's not a foul
28/10/2018, 16:44 - David;: *the man
28/10/2018, 16:45 - David;: Not like je slid through the back of him studs first and got some ball at the end
28/10/2018, 16:45 - Sam;: That wasn‚Äôt the case for this one. It was flicked past him, he got a little touch then brought martial down
28/10/2018, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: I thought foul until I saw the replay, on second viewing he gets the ball, not a pen
28/10/2018, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: That run up
28/10/2018, 17:07 - David;: I can see why the ref gave it at normal speed but not a pen on VAR
28/10/2018, 17:11 - David;: Great finish
28/10/2018, 17:12 - Hamish Sinclair: What's the name of this commentator? Definitely my least favourite
28/10/2018, 17:14 - David;: I recommend putting the 5 live commentary on - so much more immersive
28/10/2018, 17:17 - David;: Oh actually they are not covering this game
28/10/2018, 17:17 - Hamish Sinclair: But surely it's useless if it doesn't sync?
28/10/2018, 17:18 - David;: Yeah but you just pause it until picture catches up
28/10/2018, 17:34 - Sam;: That‚Äôs where pobga fucks people off. Stupid flick
28/10/2018, 17:35 - Hamish Sinclair: And the stupid run up
28/10/2018, 17:36 - Sam;: More the flick as it‚Äôs costs us. Did the same thing against wolves
28/10/2018, 17:36 - David;: The run up is retarded
28/10/2018, 17:36 - David;: The run up the fortnite generation deserves
28/10/2018, 17:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Frustrating on the pitch, but those emojis...those sponsership deals...He's the player you deserve
29/10/2018, 09:49 - Sam;: Gearing up for our 6 pointer against Bournemouth this Saturday lol
29/10/2018, 10:11 - David;: Mourinho was wearing a very strong coat at the weekend.
29/10/2018, 10:12 - David;: That was my main take away from the everton game
29/10/2018, 10:14 - Sam;: My take away is that lukaku holds us back. Fred allows pobga to run the game. Matic looks pedestrian now. Rashford is struggling a bit but just need a continued run up front
29/10/2018, 10:15 - David;: Where was fred playing?
29/10/2018, 10:17 - David;: But also that coat - a high neckline, it would really keep the chill off your collar bone
29/10/2018, 10:19 - Sam;: Get me picture of this fucking coat.
29/10/2018, 10:20 - Sam;: Fred was in a pretty fluid midfield 3 with pobga and matic. The engine on the boy
29/10/2018, 10:20 - Sam;: The boy Fred
29/10/2018, 10:21 - David;: What do you do with mata though? He's been playing well
29/10/2018, 10:22 - Sam;: Yeah keep him him tbh. It‚Äôs lukaku to drop like he did yesterday
29/10/2018, 10:22 - David;: You certai ly get more movement without romelu
29/10/2018, 10:22 - Sam;: His finishing has gone at the moment as well so you get nothing
29/10/2018, 10:52 - David;: Will have to wait until match of the day is uploaded
30/10/2018, 15:33 - Rob;: The news today that we've lost 60% of all vertebrate populations on average since 1970 has made everything seem quite sureal
30/10/2018, 15:33 - Rob;: Sitting at a desk reading recipes in the middle of the sixth mass extinction event
30/10/2018, 15:34 - Damian Rumble: It was tasty so it was worth it
30/10/2018, 15:36 - Rob;: The irony being that farm animals will probably all we have left in 2070
30/10/2018, 16:03 - David;: You dont make friebds with salad
30/10/2018, 16:04 - David;: Rob did you see the waitrose magasine editors email about killing all vegans?
30/10/2018, 16:10 - Rob;: Yeah we were just talking about it
30/10/2018, 16:11 - Rob;: Most people know him quite well
30/10/2018, 16:11 - Rob;: A renowned cunt apparently
30/10/2018, 16:12 - Rob;: I'm surprised he even had time to reply, I can barely get my editor to look at a layout
30/10/2018, 16:16 - Rob;: He'll certainly be fired I think, if Waitrose are anything like Tesco
30/10/2018, 20:57 - Rob;: The bake off final has the air of a much anticipated Champions League final tainted by refereeing interventions
30/10/2018, 20:58 - David;: Yeah similar. The pitta fire gimmick stands in for salah's injury on 30 mins
30/10/2018, 20:58 - Rob;: The teams just aren't performing as well as we know they can
30/10/2018, 20:59 - Rob;: Raoul's got concussion
30/10/2018, 21:00 - David;: Stupid challenge as well - the garden thing
30/10/2018, 21:00 - Rob;: A rash challenge
30/10/2018, 21:00 - David;: I think the final showstopped should be freestyle, 4 hours make the most elaborate cake you can
30/10/2018, 21:01 - Rob;: Yeah, you just want people to do the best thing they can and judge them on that
30/10/2018, 21:04 - David;: Setting up a rahul victory. Infuriating
30/10/2018, 21:11 - David;: For fuck sake. Embarassing.
30/10/2018, 22:12 - Damian Rumble: Rahul. What the fuck. He should have gone in the quarters. The other two miles better across the while season.

02/11/2018, 18:49 - Rob;: I have a feeling that the way we tend to start slow will mean if will be over at half time, then we'll pull back a consolation into he second half
02/11/2018, 18:51 - David;: 1-1
02/11/2018, 18:52 - David;: Think it may be more tight than we expect
02/11/2018, 18:52 - Rob;: Not sure we will have the personal to achieve that
02/11/2018, 18:53 - Rob;: We're looking at xhaka at left back and Lichsteiner at right back, the classics combo of rash and old
02/11/2018, 18:54 - Jack G;: Salah vs xhaka is terrifying
02/11/2018, 18:55 - David;: Torreira keeping a lid on things. Both sides would probs just about take a point
02/11/2018, 18:56 - David;: Why is there this need to play xhaka at left back? Surely better to throw a centre or right back in there than upset the balance of centre mid?
02/11/2018, 18:57 - Rob;: Maybe, but we have 3 centre halves and injured too
02/11/2018, 18:58 - Rob;: And Bellerin is injured, so can't play a right back there

05/11/2018, 00:10 - David;: How have they dissagregated the voting? Doesn't look like parliamentary constituencies
05/11/2018, 00:10 - Rob;: I can't vouch for its accuracy at all
05/11/2018, 00:10 - David;: Also why keep scotland aggregated as a whole voting block - that should be mapped at the same level of granularity
05/11/2018, 00:11 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
05/11/2018, 00:11 - David;: E.g there were leave voting scotish fishing regions
05/11/2018, 00:12 - Damian Rumble: Though admittedly I butchered the spelling
05/11/2018, 00:13 - Rob;: I understand states have capitals, I just think it's funny you chose an island ruled from afar as part of a larger power as your example of the opposite
05/11/2018, 00:14 - Damian Rumble: I did not put a lot of effort into thinking of this example tbh
05/11/2018, 08:14 - Stefan;: Nearly all the nice countryside would be gone though. For a pleasant weekend break from your urban Remain island, you'd have to get a boat to Snowdonia or Scotland

05/11/2018, 17:16 - David;: Football is over
05/11/2018, 17:18 - Sam;: Really would be shit wouldn‚Äôt. It a painful full stop on our whole supporting careers
05/11/2018, 17:18 - Sam;: It is a career
05/11/2018, 17:18 - David;: Yeah. Done. Gone
05/11/2018, 17:20 - Sam;: Listening to them discussing it on Sunday supplement. Slamming it a cynical money making move
05/11/2018, 17:22 - Paul Dickinson: What is this super league. Give me context
05/11/2018, 17:23 - David;: Government should intervene to ban it on grounds of regional economic development etc.
05/11/2018, 17:23 - David;: Top 5 are going to leave prem and enter franchise european league with no relegation
05/11/2018, 17:24 - David;: A suoer league if you will
05/11/2018, 17:24 - David;: So prem becomes a husk
05/11/2018, 17:25 - Sam;: I think someone working for sport and culture said the govt would fight it
05/11/2018, 17:29 - David;: Would face massive fan boycotts
05/11/2018, 17:32 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah that‚Äôs massively shit
05/11/2018, 17:32 - Paul Dickinson: Especially even more so with no relegation
05/11/2018, 17:32 - Paul Dickinson: Farceball
05/11/2018, 17:47 - Paul Dickinson: Ah Angola won the amputee World Cup
05/11/2018, 17:50 - Rob;: Fuck that
05/11/2018, 17:51 - Rob;: Just fuck it
05/11/2018, 18:03 - Paul Dickinson: It‚Äôs all your teams fault though rob. ¬£90 a ticket to the Emirates. You caused this greed

05/11/2018, 18:47 - Rob;: I've never actually paid more than ¬£45. It's the TV money not the price of seats that are making clubs do things like this
05/11/2018, 18:56 - Paul Dickinson: There won‚Äôt be any prawn sandwiches in the European super league either
05/11/2018, 20:49 - Damian Rumble: I'm watching C4s brexit:what does the nation think program? In all fairness this really is a massive remainer circle jerk. Basically an hour of dressing up a single poll as a definitive evidence that nigel farage is a cunt
05/11/2018, 20:56 - Rob;: Yeah it's been very annoying
05/11/2018, 20:57 - Rob;: It's a big poll, but they're treating it like a referendum
05/11/2018, 20:58 - Rob;: Sir stats man poured cold water on it anyway 'people who never vote still think what they always think but won't vote for'

06/11/2018, 13:08 - Sam;: Any want some free Q?
06/11/2018, 13:08 - Sam;: Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

06/11/2018, 13:08 - Sam;: This is the new hypecoin
06/11/2018, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: CBA getting involved in another pyramid scheme
06/11/2018, 13:09 - Sam;: Always one. Ponzi was a great guy
06/11/2018, 13:54 - David;: What could go wrong? Pyramids are such a stable structure
06/11/2018, 13:59 - Paul Dickinson: How much Q is a pint of milk?
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: Q currently has no monetary value
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: But it‚Äôs free mate
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: Free Q
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: Q can‚Äôt go wrong
06/11/2018, 14:01 - David;: Can you call something free that's worth nothing?
06/11/2018, 14:02 - Paul Dickinson: Sucked in by the Q hype. They‚Äôve probably just added you to a mailing list of people susceptible to absolute shite and then just sell on your details
06/11/2018, 14:02 - David;: 'They're giving out free fecal sludge over there, quick sign up'
06/11/2018, 14:03 - Sam;: But What if fecal sludge become the most used fuel worldwide ?
06/11/2018, 14:03 - Sam;: Sister sludge would be sitting on a gold mine
06/11/2018, 14:04 - Paul Dickinson: If it‚Äôs free why can‚Äôt you just be a good old Lad and get all the q fir us
06/11/2018, 14:04 - Sam;: I am, it‚Äôs referral only.
06/11/2018, 14:05 - Sam;: My link gets 5 people in
06/11/2018, 14:06 - Paul Dickinson: Sounds like a big ole piece of shite
06/11/2018, 14:06 - Damian Rumble: This is exactly what is happening
06/11/2018, 14:06 - Sam;: It probably is but if they get it right..
06/11/2018, 14:07 - Sam;: You‚Äôll be looking at My sludge pile with envy

06/11/2018, 14:07 - Damian Rumble: But surely by printing 'money' and giving it away for free they are actually reducing value?
06/11/2018, 14:08 - Damian Rumble: Flooding the market with sludge
06/11/2018, 14:08 - Sam;: It‚Äôs as if you haven‚Äôt watched the promo video..

06/11/2018, 14:10 - Sam;: How can infinity kiss?
06/11/2018, 14:11 - Rob;: But zero to the power of zero is often considered one
06/11/2018, 14:11 - Rob;: How could if fail once you know that?
06/11/2018, 14:15 - Damian Rumble: Alot of that promo video is very Wizard of Oz. There's a lot of tapping of heels together, handing over of contact details and trusting that, through the power of 'technology' you will definitely become rich
06/11/2018, 14:16 - Sam;: It‚Äôs just an email address..
06/11/2018, 14:16 - Sam;: The platform will launch in late 2021
06/11/2018, 14:16 - David;: Feacal to the power feacal = feacal
06/11/2018, 14:17 - Damian Rumble: I also don't buy thier assertion that 'currencies become more valuable as the become more popular'. I think they need to have some kind of Intrinsic value to start with and then that will increase.
06/11/2018, 14:17 - Damian Rumble: Even sludge has value
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Sam;: That‚Äôs what the platform is about a global marketplace where currency is easier to pay with and take payment of. They reckon they‚Äôll butt fuck Bitcoin
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Sam;: The rumbix cube
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Rob;: You guys are going to hate 2021 when Sam and I are trillionaires
06/11/2018, 14:19 - David;: The value of money derives from its position in social and political institutions and is grounded in generalised trust. Intrinsic value is a bad way of thinking about it.
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Rob;: *trillionaires in Q
06/11/2018, 14:20 - Sam;: Qdogs
06/11/2018, 14:20 - David;: Q must be mad
06/11/2018, 14:20 - David;: Are Q joking mate?
06/11/2018, 14:20 - Sam;: The HQ is in Quebec
06/11/2018, 14:21 - Rob;: I'm very confident
06/11/2018, 14:21 - David;: The Qban missile crisis
06/11/2018, 14:23 - Sam;: You need to click your email to verify yourself Rob.
06/11/2018, 14:24 - Sam;: Check junk folder. Lol
06/11/2018, 14:25 - Rob;: Yeah, right into my spam. I can't see why.

06/11/2018, 14:31 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
06/11/2018, 14:32 - David;: What did you buy your bitcoin for damo?
06/11/2018, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: Around about 7USD per coin
06/11/2018, 14:40 - David;: So you're still up a fair bit - how much did you buy?
06/11/2018, 14:40 - Sam;: It‚Äôs a long term strategy damo.
06/11/2018, 14:41 - David;: Did you sell any at the peak?
06/11/2018, 14:41 - Phill: Lol two trillion coins. So if each Q has a value of $1, the tech has a market capitalisation of $2trn. 2 Apples. Good luck.
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: Nah that‚Äôs the amount being given away
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: Read the roadmap
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: The highway to hell
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Damian Rumble: Well I could probably be up quite a lot more if I hadn't had spent most of it on drugs...
06/11/2018, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: But if you take that into account it's probably somewhere between ¬£500/¬£1000
06/11/2018, 14:45 - Jack G;: Sam, this all sounds too good to be Q
06/11/2018, 14:45 - David;: How much did the fbi nick?
06/11/2018, 14:45 - Damian Rumble: Oh yes I forgot about that. The it's deffo around ¬£500
06/11/2018, 14:46 - Damian Rumble: If I had the stuff the FBI has and also some I lost in a marketing than ran an exit scam then probably several thousand
06/11/2018, 14:46 - David;: üëå
06/11/2018, 14:47 - Damian Rumble: Total invested is probably about ¬£200??
06/11/2018, 14:48 - David;: 'A marketing than ran an exit scam'???
06/11/2018, 14:49 - Damian Rumble: A dark web market I had money just stopped trading one day and stole everyone's money
06/11/2018, 14:49 - Damian Rumble: *had money in
06/11/2018, 14:50 - David;: Wait surely if you bought at $2 dollars and it's now $4,000 odd it would be worth a lot more than ¬£500?
06/11/2018, 14:53 - Damian Rumble: Yeah but I sold a lot in 2014 after a lost a chunk around the first bubble
06/11/2018, 14:54 - Damian Rumble: I mean if you're asking if I had never bought our traded the coins once a bought them then i would probably into the 10,000USD...
06/11/2018, 14:56 - David;: But even if you only had ¬£1 left of your original purchase it wpuld be worth ¬£2,500 now, as it's gone up from ¬£2 per coin to ¬£5,000 per coin
06/11/2018, 14:57 - Damian Rumble: I think the mood in 2014 when the crash happened was that this was the end of bitcoin so I got everything out then
06/11/2018, 14:58 - David;: Ah right so you didn't keep any
06/11/2018, 16:35 - / James Ball: PayPal took at least 10 years to become accepted by major banks. How long will it take Q in the much more saturated market?
06/11/2018, 16:39 - / James Ball: What's the incentive to use Q over any other currency? Certainly not anonymity as it offers none of the benefits of real blockchain currencies in that regard
06/11/2018, 16:50 - Sam;: They tryna make it harder for the value to fluctuate. stability
06/11/2018, 16:53 - Rob;: You're all just jealous
06/11/2018, 16:57 - David;: Feacal + More Feacal ‚âà Still Absolute Raw Shit
06/11/2018, 17:28 - Paul Dickinson: >they tryna make it harder
06/11/2018, 17:30 - / James Ball: Nice and stable as no one accepts it. Value remains stable at 0
06/11/2018, 17:32 - Paul Dickinson: Just sounds like a big hulking bag of shit
06/11/2018, 17:42 - Jack G;: A hulking bag of shit would be preferable, it‚Äôs at least good for composting
06/11/2018, 17:43 - Rob;: The Q-ma millions though
06/11/2018, 17:44 - Paul Dickinson: Where‚Äôs Phil in all this? Definitely the man behind the curtain

07/11/2018, 12:22 - Phill: Stefan need some legal advice
07/11/2018, 12:23 - Phill: The guy at work moved into a new flat. There was a contract written up but he didn't sign it. The flat turned out to be shit, so he moved out. He informed the landlord but the landlord said that the contract was valid given that he had moved in, payed the first month's rent etc. It didn't seem to matter that nothing was signed.
07/11/2018, 12:23 - Phill: Landlord now saying he's liable for full tenancy rent payment.
07/11/2018, 12:23 - Phill: Whit do?
07/11/2018, 12:31 - Stefan;: Yeah I think by moving in and paying rent he's implicitly agreed to the tenancy terms. It doesn't necessarily have to be signed to take effect
07/11/2018, 12:44 - Sam;: Can the the state of the flat be deemed a breach by the landlord?
07/11/2018, 12:45 - Jack G;: I imagine it would have to be in a state of disrepair
07/11/2018, 12:45 - Damian Rumble: In all fairness the guy probably should have visited this place before agreeing to live there
07/11/2018, 12:56 - Stefan;: Yes, but it only entitles you to claim damages. You still have to pay rent until the tenancy is validly terminated by either side - you can't usually withhold rent because of disrepair
07/11/2018, 12:58 - Stefan;: And damages would only be equivalent to the full rent if it's literally uninhabitable - usually you'd get less
07/11/2018, 12:59 - Phill: It wasn't the flat, it was his co-tenants.
07/11/2018, 12:59 - Phill: Noisy alcoholics
07/11/2018, 12:59 - Phill: Up all night.
07/11/2018, 13:13 - Sam;: Watching America
07/11/2018, 13:29 - David;: Think that weakens his case further because landlord can claim the behaviour of flatmates is not his fault?
07/11/2018, 13:31 - David;: That's pretty mental. So you can be living in a dingy dank leaky shithole but if it's inhabitable there's no way to break tenancy early?
07/11/2018, 13:32 - Jack G;: Not surprising, a huge percentage of Tory MPs are landlords
07/11/2018, 13:34 - David;: True, but the legislation that set out that relationship predates this government i would imagine. And would probs be determined by a lot of case history?
07/11/2018, 13:36 - Rob;: Would the payment of the rent imply agreement for the terms only for the duration big the rent paid though?
07/11/2018, 13:37 - Rob;: Ie. Only one month, not the full duration of the unsigned contract? Normally when you come to the end of a tenancy agreement but remain in a property paying rent it's treated as a rolling month's contract
07/11/2018, 13:50 - Jack G;: He should have got some Q and he‚Äôd be able to bail himself out of this situation
07/11/2018, 14:00 - Stefan;: Nope. Only by giving 2 months notice (during which you still have to pay rent)
07/11/2018, 14:00 - Stefan;: It's all from the Thatcher/Major era. Before that all private tenants had security of tenure

07/11/2018, 18:09 - Phill: The best bummer was while each person wanted seconds and the pot turned into empty.
07/11/2018, 19:58 - David;: Weird to be supporting Mourinho. A team even more cuntish than him.
07/11/2018, 20:29 - David;: Young is painfull shit. How is he still there in the first team? Horrible touch, no vision, very slow decision making.
07/11/2018, 20:31 - David;: Touch of a 1970s children's tv presenter

08/11/2018, 22:55 - Stefan;: Nah I'm not poly. That involves having multiple relationships, which is far too much work
08/11/2018, 22:56 - Stefan;: The main thing I observe about poly relationships is the level of constant admin involved

12/11/2018, 17:22 - Damian Rumble: #LondonLife
12/11/2018, 17:22 - Damian Rumble: That's actually how much I pay for it

12/11/2018, 17:23 - Jack G;: >London
12/11/2018, 17:23 - Phill: So you'd have to pay ¬£1800 a month if you don't find someone?

12/11/2018, 17:23 - Phill: The same amount I pay for my mortgage every 6 months?
12/11/2018, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: But I also don't have to pay for a peak time season rail ticket and endure 2 hours of my life lost to sitting with sweat plebs every day
12/11/2018, 17:24 - David;: Leave London. Simple solution.
12/11/2018, 17:24 - Phill: LEXIT LEXIT LEXIT

12/11/2018, 17:27 - Phill: >not living the country life and visiting the city for leisure rather than a financial raping
12/11/2018, 17:27 - Paul Dickinson: Taking the train for 60mins to visit the thriving cesspit. It‚Äôs not like the journey from North Dakota to nyc
12/11/2018, 17:28 - Stefan;: Jobs pay more in London, so the relative cost of housing isn't as bad as it looks
12/11/2018, 17:28 - Phill: Shut up Stefan.
12/11/2018, 17:29 - Paul Dickinson: I thought people are being raped 60% of income on rent

12/11/2018, 17:31 - Damian Rumble: I going to leave work now and enjoy my 10min walk home to my house. Then after that I'm going to head out into the city. What are doing with your evening? Oh that's right... Sitting in a train
12/11/2018, 17:31 - Jack G;: If you don‚Äôt get mugged
12/11/2018, 17:32 - Phill: Just got home. Heading out to a country pub for dinner and a reasonably priced pint with Becca. Then I'll probably head home, have a joint then go to bed.

12/11/2018, 17:47 - David;: Home of United though. Old toilet putting a downer on things.
12/11/2018, 17:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Cover the nose
12/11/2018, 17:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Also, pretty sure they arnt I'm Manchester

12/11/2018, 17:52 - Phill: Didn't think you did trains damo
12/11/2018, 17:52 - Damian Rumble: Wut?
12/11/2018, 17:55 - / James Ball: No I live 15 minutes away from Phil. In England.
12/11/2018, 17:56 - / James Ball: Just saying you could be more financially prudent by investing in Newport than flogging your smogshack in the city
12/11/2018, 17:58 - Hamish Sinclair: This definitely isn't true for public sector jobs
12/11/2018, 18:00 - David;: There is a small London wage supplement for teachers isn't there? But nowhere close to compensating for housing and living costs.
12/11/2018, 18:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, small supplement but doesn't cover difference between Brighton and London let alone further north
12/11/2018, 18:02 - Hamish Sinclair: But I guess there are some jobs that you can only really get in London so not really a choice for many
12/11/2018, 18:51 - Sam;: A gin and tonic will just slip down. You can be 4 drinks deep before you know it

12/11/2018, 20:46 - David;: Forget the booze, you come mainly for the ambient warmth.
12/11/2018, 20:47 - Phill: The heat was punishing. I felt cooked when I woke up in the morning.
12/11/2018, 20:48 - David;: It's the dehydration that gets you more than the booze with a hangover anyway.
12/11/2018, 20:48 - David;: Could you not have opened a window?
12/11/2018, 20:51 - Rob;: Phil's wouldn't open

14/11/2018, 19:28 - Rob;: We are so heading for rejection of the agreement and no deal
14/11/2018, 19:29 - Phill: THANK FUUUUCCCKK
14/11/2018, 19:29 - Phill: The proposed deal was an absolute piece of shit
14/11/2018, 19:32 - Phill: Lol just seen her statement. This, no deal or no Brexit
14/11/2018, 19:35 - Jack G;: Let‚Äôs fucking vote on these 3 options then. Ranked preference
14/11/2018, 19:37 - Phill: 1. No Deal
2. No Brexit 
3. Deal worse than remaining
14/11/2018, 19:40 - Rob;: That's why it will fail. It pleases no one
14/11/2018, 19:41 - Jack G;: It could please moderates who want brexit but can‚Äôt be arsed with it in the commons/news anymore. Although they‚Äôd be wrong
14/11/2018, 19:42 - Rob;: But that would only count if it goes to a referendum, which seems very unlikely
14/11/2018, 19:42 - Rob;: MPs will reject it and then it'll be no deal
14/11/2018, 19:43 - Jack G;: I really doubt MPs will reject it without there being some sort of mechanism to avoid no deal
14/11/2018, 19:43 - Jack G;: Which is what May is counting on
14/11/2018, 19:43 - Phill: I'd reject the fuck out of it.
14/11/2018, 19:44 - David;: Ironic that the hardest brexiteers are those opening a possible door to no brexit
14/11/2018, 19:45 - David;: This is why i think she may scrape it through commons by a whisker. Unfortunately.
14/11/2018, 19:46 - Rob;: It'll be well tight I think - there are motives on both sides to reject it
14/11/2018, 19:47 - David;: Few labour rebels who fear no deal more than this plus a few brexiters who don't want to compromise the whole thing or open door to general election/second ref swinging behind it.
14/11/2018, 19:47 - David;: That's all it needs really.
14/11/2018, 19:48 - Rob;: It'll be interesting
14/11/2018, 19:49 - Rob;: Interesting like watching both granddads fight each other over which hole to fuck your mum in
14/11/2018, 20:18 - David;: If you don't eat yer meat yer can't have any Brexit. How can you have any brexit if you don't eat yer meat?
14/11/2018, 21:05 - Stefan;: I think it'll fail in parliament. Labour will vote against it (it fails their 6 tests) and so will the rest of the opposition. Only then needs the DUP or a few Tory rebels to rebel and it'll fail.
14/11/2018, 21:17 - David;: Yeah but that's assuming all labour MPs follow whip. Can't see that happening especially as loads of them are completely alienated from the leadership anyway.
14/11/2018, 21:18 - Stefan;: There are still enough Tory remainer and hard Brexiteer rebels though
14/11/2018, 21:19 - Jack G;: I think they‚Äôll be a leadership election before it gets to a vote anyway tbh
14/11/2018, 21:21 - David;: That's the question really. Do labour pro-deal rebels outnumber tory anti-deal rebels. But she can also bribe them with cushy jobs etc. to bring them around - their anti-deal stance could be partly a bargaining/negotiating chip outside of the real ideologues like Mogg.
14/11/2018, 21:22 - David;: The ERG is only like 50 mps right?
14/11/2018, 21:30 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
14/11/2018, 21:32 - David;: Fuck sake - just give us orgies, gambling and autists louis
14/11/2018, 22:22 - Damian Rumble: Hate to agree with Phil but I agree. We will become rule takers (pretty much what remain were saying during the ref.).
14/11/2018, 22:23 - Damian Rumble: Pretty sure I read somewhere that the DUP were planning to vote against
14/11/2018, 22:25 - Damian Rumble: If there's no clear Brexit agreement by the 21st of January then I think parliamentary powers start to kick in. They should be able to force the government to extend article 50 to avoid no deal (I hope)
14/11/2018, 22:27 - Damian Rumble: Nah. There's about 10 that would vote for but that's easily countered by the DUP, 40 Tory brexiters and 20 Tory remainers not voting for it
14/11/2018, 22:29 - Damian Rumble: Can't really see May surviving a no vote. She totally owns this plan a rejection would be fatal to her authority. Who takes after that is anyone's game though ....

15/11/2018, 00:46 - David;: Great joke
15/11/2018, 07:54 - Rob;: I think it's worked out puns/musdirection - so once it's chosen Tony Hawk it's punning on hawk, as if Tony is literally a bird. Then it's chosen a bird fact - they have hollow bones

At the time of viewing it was unfurnished despite being advertised as furnished. As part of the contract we agreed it would be 'fully furnished' and I also sent a list defining what that was. We are now finding out that the landlord bis trying to give us the barest of essentials.

25/11/2018, 17:44 - David;: Hes got his gritty little second place.to cling onto though. And he will cling.
25/11/2018, 17:47 - David;: 1 point seperating 15th and 20th. Hib.
25/11/2018, 22:50 - Damian Rumble: Dave - planning a little too to California in January. Primarily based on LA but also thinking of road tripping it up to SanFran. Recommendations on things to do please? Both in and out of the cities
25/11/2018, 23:01 - Stefan;: Big Sur is a beautiful coastline to drive along. There's Napa and Sonoma wine regions near SF. And Yosemite if you have the time (further inland)
25/11/2018, 23:11 - David;: Yeah. I wouldn't personally recommend Napa that much, the tastings are fucking expensive and marked up for tourists; you can buy all the wine cheaper just in wine shops. Depends how much time you have. The best places I've been are Death Valley, Joshua Tree and Yosemite, but they are a bit of a drive to the east. Lake Tahoe is great for a weekend skiing - again, a drive to get there. If you want to stay on the coast then yeah, Big Sur is good for Redwoods and walking - Humbolt is even better but its further up the coast. Monterrey you can get very cheap and reliable whale watching boat trips if you're interested. I was underwhelmed by the aquarium but everyone else seems to rate it.
25/11/2018, 23:13 - David;: If you want to see Joshua Tree np cheaply you can camp on at these sites owned by the bureau of land management for free, there's one in twentynine palms. Then drive down through the desert and do walks etc. That's pretty cool.
25/11/2018, 23:19 - David;: In SF hiring a bike and going over GG bridge to sausilito is worth it. Golden Gate park also decent. The mission district has good restaurants and street food. The museums are shit, it seems like you need to have conquered a quarter of the world to have decent museums. Bit further south is half moon bay which has decent beaches.
25/11/2018, 23:23 - David;: I suppose you'll want to get the cleched selfie outside facebook headquarters and embarass yourself.

25/11/2018, 23:26 - David;: Competely unique and scope everywhere
25/11/2018, 23:27 - Damian Rumble: We are playing in a tournament on Huntington beach but we all agree we'd rather not spend the rest of the time in the city. We are talking about hiring a car and driving to alot if the national parks a week either side
25/11/2018, 23:33 - David;: Yeah, definitely Joshua Tree then, it's pretty close to LA only like a 3-4 hour drive. And quite small you only need like 2 days to see it.

02/12/2018, 19:34 - David;: The one advantage they have over top 6 obliterated
02/12/2018, 19:36 - Rob;: That's quite good, because it's a bit shit for Europa League teams who play through all those shit group games only to meat a really big team who fucked up in the CL.
02/12/2018, 19:37 - Rob;: Really reinforces how second rate the Europa League is by letting CL failures in
02/12/2018, 19:38 - David;: Don't think this would change that though?

03/12/2018, 21:54 - David;: This season - 0 goals, 2 assists

04/12/2018, 18:47 - Hamish Sinclair: There's no way they'll ban the reigning champions
04/12/2018, 20:21 - Phill: Christmas junk mail is getting to an annoying level. I'm having to filter post from charities and bin it before Becca sees it as she becomes aggrieved at not donating.
04/12/2018, 21:11 - / James Ball: I've had none at all so far. Maybe you're just a known charitable man Phil.
04/12/2018, 21:12 - Phill: She gets butthurt because the quality of the marketing is clearly expensive
04/12/2018, 21:12 - Phill: Why not just spend the marketing budget on causes?
04/12/2018, 21:20 - Damian Rumble: Your household clearly had a high propensity to engage with charitable causes and therefore they target you with the good shit.
04/12/2018, 21:25 - Phill: But I only donate to the national trust. Don't get why I'm getting bombarded with smack head Sharon and HIV Lee.
04/12/2018, 21:49 - / James Ball: Ah, you donate so you're on a list I guess. If you want to be super passive aggressive you can just send it all back to them in their deepest envelopes they usually include
04/12/2018, 21:49 - / James Ball: freepost*
04/12/2018, 21:54 - David;: Smothered in shit, obviously
04/12/2018, 22:12 - Rob;: I donate my shit to the RSPB every month
04/12/2018, 22:13 - Paul Dickinson: We should really exploit all the free shit animals give us better. Why throw away a dog shit. It must have another better use
04/12/2018, 22:14 - David;: I donate ¬£2 a month but entirely in small denomination zimbabwean dollars.
04/12/2018, 22:14 - Rob;: Fertilizer

05/12/2018, 12:03 - David;: That can fuck off.
05/12/2018, 12:06 - David;: Orwell's 'politics and the English language' is a fitting refutation
05/12/2018, 12:06 - David;: Hasenhuttl then - 'the alpine Klopp'
05/12/2018, 12:06 - Rob;: These are by PETA
05/12/2018, 12:06 - Rob;: Most of them miss the point
05/12/2018, 12:07 - Rob;: Grabbing a bull by the horns nullifies the threat, grabbing an inanimate flower by the thorns is increasing the threat
05/12/2018, 12:08 - Phill: >be the test tube
05/12/2018, 12:09 - Rob;: I do hate the phrase killing two birds with one stone though, as if stones are a resource we need to preserve
05/12/2018, 12:10 - Rob;: Birds fucking everywhere. Feel like I need to kill them but don't want to waste stones
05/12/2018, 12:10 - David;: Don't think the stones are the point, rather the effort of throwing them
05/12/2018, 12:10 - David;: Why throw 2 when you get the job done with one?
05/12/2018, 12:11 - Phill: Nob 2 birds wiv 1 conny
05/12/2018, 12:11 - Rob;: But who's choosing throwing stones as their method of ornicide
05/12/2018, 12:12 - David;: Could be using a slingshot, that's not being ruled out
05/12/2018, 12:13 - Phill: Dat Black Widow slingshot
05/12/2018, 12:14 - Sam;: It‚Äôs a pretty old saying.. if it came out now it would probably be an RPG or a SAM
05/12/2018, 12:15 - David;: >'came out'
05/12/2018, 12:17 - Rob;: Ah apparently in the 1600s the phrase might have meant to attempt to do something too complicated, hence such a shit method of murder
05/12/2018, 12:17 - Damian Rumble: "kill two IS terrorists with one IDE"
05/12/2018, 12:18 - Rob;: Or alternatively it's from the story of Icarus and Dedalus when they only had stones with which to kill birds to get feathers
05/12/2018, 12:18 - Rob;: IS are the ones making IEDs

07/12/2018, 17:47 - Phill: Banners or Oxford?
07/12/2018, 17:48 - David;: What is this? I'm off the facebook wagon now
07/12/2018, 17:49 - Phill: Sambos mad night out
07/12/2018, 17:49 - Stefan;: Ah bad timing Sam, I'm doing my own 30th weekend away with London friends the same day. Would have been up for coming otherwise
07/12/2018, 17:50 - Rob;: But you're 30 next week Stefan
07/12/2018, 17:51 - David;: You've always been the caretaker
07/12/2018, 17:51 - Rob;: I'll do mine on Paul's birthday
07/12/2018, 17:53 - Stefan;: Yeah but getting people to do a weekend away just before Christmas
07/12/2018, 17:53 - Stefan;: Who rediculous a notion
07/12/2018, 18:03 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
07/12/2018, 18:04 - Phill: Anyone shotgunned your flat yet? If not, shotgun
07/12/2018, 18:08 - Paul Dickinson: Hiring out a venue in banbury
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Paul Dickinson: Hire out a village hall like old school parties
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Paul Dickinson: Hooky sports club
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Rob;: Great Rollright village hall is great
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Rob;: It's got a fridge
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Rob;: Field out the back. Sorted
07/12/2018, 18:10 - Sam;: Looking at attic in banners
07/12/2018, 18:10 - Phill: Prefer cellar myself
07/12/2018, 18:11 - Paul Dickinson: Room in the back of spoons
07/12/2018, 19:57 - Sam;: Shotgun is out for this one. I‚Äôm gonna have to judge it on biggest need.
07/12/2018, 19:58 - Phill: Fair. If it's in Banbury we can stay at my mum's
07/12/2018, 19:59 - Sam;: Yeah That would help
07/12/2018, 20:00 - Phill: So can one or two others
07/12/2018, 20:00 - Phill: Share a taxi
07/12/2018, 20:00 - Paul Dickinson: Yarp
07/12/2018, 20:52 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 07:25 - Phill: Had a dream last night that we were at ByC and a nuclear war was declared. You could see nuclear warheads flying through the blue sky over Cader.
08/12/2018, 08:38 - Rob;: Beautiful
08/12/2018, 08:39 - Phill: Yeah it was great, they didn't fly fast, they almost floated by, they all looked different too we were just sitting outside looking up saying shit like "that looks American"
08/12/2018, 08:40 - Rob;: BYC is such a good apocalypse fantasy house
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Damian Rumble: Going to byc is my zombie escape plan
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Rob;: Although do you remember how big that Russian bomb was? The one we dropped down the Crown and Cushion and it wiped out your house in Gloucester
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Phill: The Tsar Bomba
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Phill: 50 Mt
08/12/2018, 08:42 - Rob;: Yeah I've said to Julia she'll have to put up with living with you all if there's a zombie apocalypse as we'd all have the same plan
08/12/2018, 08:42 - Rob;: I have a zip van just outside my portfolio I'd fill with cans and makeshift weapons. Savage fighting my way down the M1 though
08/12/2018, 08:43 - Rob;: If that fell on say Liverpool would BYC be fucked
08/12/2018, 08:43 - Phill: Would probably be ok
08/12/2018, 08:44 - Phill: Think ByC is far enough away from any significant city
08/12/2018, 08:44 - Phill: My house is only 30miles from chippy
08/12/2018, 08:45 - Phill: We would need weapons as we'd need to do looting runs to dolgellau
08/12/2018, 08:45 - Phill: We'd have to form a partnership with the farmer. He's probably got some shotguns
08/12/2018, 08:46 - Damian Rumble: Unfortunately the only downside of moving to London is that the odds of surviving an  apocalypse have considerably lengthened
08/12/2018, 08:46 - Phill: The spring water also wouldn't get polluted by fallout which is a bonus
08/12/2018, 08:47 - Phill: >zip van outside my portfolio
08/12/2018, 08:48 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 08:49 - Rob;: I meant flat, autocorrect new better
08/12/2018, 08:49 - Rob;: Which I imagine he'd use to kill us to stop us wrecking his own survival plan
08/12/2018, 08:50 - Phill: Nah I think we could be diplomatic. Safety in numbers. We could offer protection, work the farm.
08/12/2018, 08:51 - Phill: There would be roaming groups of chavs looking for resources. He'd want some more people on side I think.
08/12/2018, 08:52 - Phill: He was with us in my dream.
08/12/2018, 08:52 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 08:52 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 08:53 - Phill: The most valuable thing in my dream was the engine of the warhead (bits of the missiles fell off as it flew, much like a rocket)
08/12/2018, 08:53 - Rob;: So I think if Tsar Bomba was dropped on Liverpool or Dublin while we were in BYC we'd get our precious windows smashed
08/12/2018, 08:53 - Phill: So we would be OK, just
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Rob;: Yeah, very, very narrowly
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Phill: They'd probably save those big ones for London
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Rob;: Same with Cardiff
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Phill: Only drop some shitty little 10Mt on Liverpool
08/12/2018, 08:55 - Rob;: Although I can see all Welsh cities coming out of a nuclear war completely unscathed die to lack of foreign knowledge as to what Wales is
08/12/2018, 08:55 - Phill: We'd need to get there quickly as they would probably start defending the border to stop millions of refugees from England
08/12/2018, 08:57 - Phill: Biggest nuclear weapon in US armoury is 1.2Mt
08/12/2018, 08:58 - Phill: So 40 times smaller than the Tsar Bomba
08/12/2018, 08:59 - Rob;: Total shit
08/12/2018, 08:59 - Phill: Think they disassembled all of the big weapons after the cold war
08/12/2018, 08:59 - Rob;: How much of a tiny fork is Trident?
08/12/2018, 09:00 - Phill: Trident 2 D5 missile is ~450Kt
08/12/2018, 09:01 - Phill: >not even having a 1Mt
08/12/2018, 09:01 - Rob;: You'll barely feel it
08/12/2018, 09:03 - Phill: It's more tactical these days. More, smaller weapons
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: That you can drop on specific targets
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: We'd get fucked Russia anyway.
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: They have about 7000 warheads
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: We've got 200
08/12/2018, 09:05 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 09:06 - Phill: Drop trident on Shoreditch
08/12/2018, 09:09 - Rob;: Well yeah it completely fucks all of central London, kills 600,000 people. Perhaps they should target major cities instead of small Welsh towns

08/12/2018, 12:46 - David;: Look at you as if you've gone mental when you mention it. The idea of England not being coextensive with the uk is baffling to them.
08/12/2018, 12:52 - Rob;: An appreciable number of them must be of Welsh decent
08/12/2018, 12:54 - Rob;: More Jones in America than anywhere else - 2.7 million
08/12/2018, 17:22 - Damian Rumble: On the topic of Wales. This is a conversation my kiwi house mate and I just had... 

Kiwi - "what's the weather like is Essex? You went to uni there right?" 
Me - "umm... We are basically in Essex here. You mean Exeter. It's alright"
Kiwi - "ah Exeter. That's in Wales right"
Me - "urgh no"
Kiwi - "ah ok. Wales is a great place. I had a great time when I visited the lake District"
Me - "the lake District is not in Wales.its no where near it mate"
Kiwi - "ok well fuck it"

09/12/2018, 09:34 - Rob;: That's very 'I liked his first album, but i'm not really into Phil these days. I mean he's dressing very different now'
09/12/2018, 09:34 - Phill: Lol
09/12/2018, 09:35 - Phill: They're troll wear because Becca hates them so much
09/12/2018, 10:26 - Phill: Also got this one. Great froustwear.

09/12/2018, 18:18 - Phill: Just watching The Pacific.
09/12/2018, 18:18 - Phill: Why were Japan in cahoots with Nazi Germany?
09/12/2018, 18:21 - Rob;: Because of Japan's opposition to the society union
09/12/2018, 18:21 - Rob;: *soviet
09/12/2018, 18:22 - Phill: But they're fine with Nazis?
09/12/2018, 18:22 - Phill: Get your shit together Japan
09/12/2018, 18:23 - Rob;: I don't think it was so clear cut that they were so evil
09/12/2018, 18:24 - Phill: Dat fucking society union mang
09/12/2018, 18:24 - Rob;: Every player in ww2 was pretty bad tbh
09/12/2018, 18:34 - Stefan;: The Japanese were pretty keen on their own racial supremacy and domination of lesser races
09/12/2018, 18:34 - Stefan;: I guess they just agreed to disagree with the Nazis about who was number one
09/12/2018, 18:57 - Phill: Maximum froust enabled

09/12/2018, 18:58 - Rob;: I'm about to east a brie to dip roast potatoes in
09/12/2018, 18:58 - Rob;: Motd  from yesterday on
09/12/2018, 18:58 - Rob;: Word from Theresa May's spokesman, via my housemate who he's friends with, is that tomorrow's vote on the Brexit deal is off because they know they don't have the numbers
09/12/2018, 18:59 - Rob;: How they'd delay it on the day I have no ide
09/12/2018, 18:59 - Stefan;: I was thinking she'd do this. But I don't see how delaying it will win over the 100 or so Tory MPs who are against it
09/12/2018, 19:00 - Rob;: No, unless it's just to sail closer to the wind and make the prospect of no deal more real and more terrifying
09/12/2018, 19:19 - Phill: Just dipped pate into the camembert. The richest thing over ever eaten.
09/12/2018, 19:47 - Damian Rumble: Very embarrassing... And hard to see how this changes anything at all...
09/12/2018, 22:32 - David;: Pretty sure their alliance pre-dated the end of the ribbentrop-molotov pact. Wasnt it more to do with ideological allignment/both being massive racists?
09/12/2018, 22:38 - Rob;: You'd know it better than me I'm sure, but I think Japan's initial approach to join the Axis agreement was based on wanting to secure an anti-communist alliance
09/12/2018, 22:40 - Rob;: At least as a pretence
09/12/2018, 22:41 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
09/12/2018, 22:41 - Rob;: Seems it did predate the breaking of Germany pact with Russia. How did they get away with that?
09/12/2018, 22:43 - Rob;: Predated the start of Ribbentrop-Molotov even
10/12/2018, 08:30 - Jack G;: Looks like no deal is off the menu Phil https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46481643
10/12/2018, 08:37 - Phill: They wouldn't pull the plug on Brexit. No deal will happen .
10/12/2018, 08:38 - Jack G;: There‚Äôs no appetite in parliament for no deal. If it comes down to no deal vs. No brexit they‚Äôll cancel
10/12/2018, 08:41 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/JamesMelville/status/1072026150678028289?s=19
10/12/2018, 09:12 - Phill: Just because there's no appetite for it doesn't mean they'll just cancel Brexit
10/12/2018, 09:13 - Phill: What Dreamworld are you living in?
10/12/2018, 09:15 - Sam;: Social tension would fuckin peak
10/12/2018, 09:15 - Damian Rumble: Difficult to see an MP from a remain constituency voting to revoke brexit...
10/12/2018, 09:17 - Jack G;: There‚Äôs a large majority in parliament against no deal - probably the only thing there‚Äôs is a majority for. If no deal looks like it‚Äôs becoming inevitable, I bet they‚Äôll be moves made against it and this ECJ ruling makes that very easy
10/12/2018, 09:18 - Phill: Yeah they would probably change something but no deal is far more likely than no Brexit
10/12/2018, 09:19 - Phill: You think no deal would be a disaster? There would probably be a civil war if they just went "actually we just cancel this."
10/12/2018, 09:20 - Jack G;: Problem is we‚Äôve fucked ourselves with a 2 year deadline so renegotiations aren‚Äôt ideal
10/12/2018, 09:21 - / James Ball: I think no deal is unlikely but I also think it unlikely that they will cancel brexit
10/12/2018, 09:22 - / James Ball: I think if there was a no deal situation there will probably be a GE and the timescale extended
10/12/2018, 09:24 - Jack G;: No deal would be shit, we‚Äôd have to suspend border checks on goods and make emergency agreements for stuff like medicines, food etc. We‚Äôve done fuck all prep for it.
10/12/2018, 09:26 - Jack G;: Smuggling would make a big come back
10/12/2018, 09:26 - Sam;: Finally
10/12/2018, 09:26 - / James Ball: The precedent for a dead locked parliament however is to make changes and vote again (within parliament) not to hold another referendum
10/12/2018, 09:27 - / James Ball: Longing for smuggling
10/12/2018, 09:27 - Sam;: I need bootleggers

18/12/2018, 11:55 - David;: That's mental - i guess Ferguson had some shot season ls at the beggining before they got dominant?
18/12/2018, 11:56 - David;: And the duff period in early 2000s
18/12/2018, 11:57 - Rob;: Also some of the winning points totals in late 90s early 2000 were really low compared to now
18/12/2018, 11:57 - Rob;: Football is harder now
18/12/2018, 12:08 - Phill: So Mourinhos percentage is better?
18/12/2018, 12:11 - David;: No, because the top teams all get more points  and need more to win
18/12/2018, 12:11 - David;: So you'd expect him to get more.
18/12/2018, 12:13 - Damian Rumble: Put Mourinho in the bin
18/12/2018, 12:13 - Rob;: Yeah, it just explains why Ferguson's isn't much better - he didn't need to be

18/12/2018, 12:15 - Jack G;: The mid table teams are all much better these days with all the tv money so kind of odd how to top teams are all getting more points than historically
18/12/2018, 12:23 - David;: Hmm looking at that i'd say it's actually pretty consistent apart from the 3 years 96-99.
18/12/2018, 12:23 - David;: And man city last season
18/12/2018, 12:23 - Phill: What are you two on about? In a era where the standard is higher, Moi's percentage looks good compared to Fergusons
18/12/2018, 12:25 - David;: No, because it suggests league is less competitive. I.e. big clubs are more dominant over smaller clubs, so it's easier to get more points. But you also need to to win titles.
18/12/2018, 12:25 - Jack G;: Mou trending downwards though, Ferguson is over a much larger sample size
18/12/2018, 12:27 - Phill: The league may be less competitive, but the quality throughout the league is better compared to Fergusons era
18/12/2018, 12:27 - David;: Yes, but relative quality of top clubs vs bottom half has widened
18/12/2018, 12:28 - David;: While general standard has improved throughout
18/12/2018, 12:28 - Phill: Still don't understand how it's easier to win games in an era where the standard of the league has improved
18/12/2018, 12:29 - Phill: Doesn't make sense
18/12/2018, 12:29 - Phill: Either way. >MOU
18/12/2018, 12:33 - Sam;: Anything to try and tarnish Ferguson. Standard United bashing
18/12/2018, 12:34 - Rob;: Was just saying that 5 of the 7 lowest scoring premierleague wins were by Ferguson, which might  contribute to how he achieved so much with a win % very similar to Mourinho, who got 4th, 5th and 2nd
18/12/2018, 12:36 - Sam;: mourinho got 6th then 2nd.
18/12/2018, 12:37 - Sam;: need to compare win rate in each season, but even then in needs analysis relative performance to other clubs each season.
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Rob;: We can all agree Mourinho is shit though
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Sam;: each season the quality of the league changes and so does the relative quality between teams
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Sam;: nah
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Jack G;: I bet Ferguson has sleepless nights about his win percentage. Not like he has a huge trophy cabinet to cheer himself up with
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Sam;: still won more than klopp, poch and wenger combined
18/12/2018, 12:43 - Sam;: mourinho's PL win % was 53.8. Fergie 65.1
18/12/2018, 12:44 - Rob;: Ah that explains it
18/12/2018, 12:45 - Rob;: Won two cups in 2.4 seasons?
18/12/2018, 12:45 - Rob;: Plus a final
18/12/2018, 12:54 - Sam;: 3
18/12/2018, 12:55 - Sam;: Laurent blanc = larry white

18/12/2018, 14:40 - David;: How is it Fergie bashing? It's making the point he operated in a different era which could explain the win percentage. It's Mourinho bashing not Fergie bashing.
18/12/2018, 14:41 - Sam;: trying to diminish his trophies saying they were 'easier' to win. ridiculous
18/12/2018, 14:42 - David;: It's not saying that - completely missing the point.
18/12/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: >"Yeah, it just explains why Ferguson's isn't much better - he didn't need to be"
18/12/2018, 14:45 - David;: a) Rob's words not mine. b) point is that in an era when big clubs have less relative spending power (i.e. pre-globalization of football) then on average the big clubs drop more points. But all the big clubs are doing this so it's no easier to win titles.
18/12/2018, 14:46 - Rob;: Yeah I'm bashing Fergie, was trying to work out how their win ratios were almost identical and thought the trend towards higher point scores recently bought have explained it
18/12/2018, 14:47 - David;: Likewise now, big clubs have huge revenues/foreign owners, so tend to beat small teams more consistently. But again, many of the big clubs are like this so you have to compete with that.
18/12/2018, 14:47 - Rob;: Haha * not * bashing fergie
18/12/2018, 14:47 - Rob;: But the difference between cup and league win ratios more than explains it
18/12/2018, 14:54 - Sam;: It‚Äôs was sub conscious fergie bashing. Your natural underlying anti united bias coming out first
18/12/2018, 14:55 - David;: I mean he was a cunt.
18/12/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: I'm sorry I hurt your feelings
18/12/2018, 15:00 - Sam;: wouldn't expect any better from those who look to tear down the greatest manager in the history of the game, any chance they get.

27/12/2018, 13:08 - Rob;: Football is popular precisely because it can't be boiled down into numbers
27/12/2018, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: If you actually went and read the methodology behind how the predictions were produced you'll find an interesting discussion about how they factored in random variation, form, home-away, importance, etc into the model.
27/12/2018, 13:11 - Phill: Like you damo, I build models every day. And deep down, you know that you can't model football.
27/12/2018, 13:17 - Hamish Sinclair: There's no way they can factor in important random events, an injury to a van dijk, a failed drugs test, a pedo Adam Johnston for example
27/12/2018, 13:19 - David;: The problem is they have to ascribe two very significant variables - managerial tactics and psychology - to 'random variation'. But they're not random, they can be analysed qualitatively but not by looking at historical time series. So the most important aspects of football analysis it has to bracket out of its model.

16/01/2019, 11:27 - Phill: Favourite but yesterday was when BERCOW just shouted "UNLOCKKKK"

16/01/2019, 12:19 - David;: Yeah. Problem for postmen's backs you see.
16/01/2019, 12:19 - Sam;: Vital to debate that though
16/01/2019, 12:20 - Sam;: Why does that get to parliament. Is there not an obscure committee it can go to?
16/01/2019, 12:21 - David;: It's a law change, would require primary legislation.
16/01/2019, 12:21 - David;: Brexit can wait
16/01/2019, 12:22 - David;: Do you want to put the EU before the backs of our British postmen?
16/01/2019, 12:22 - David;: They're suffering out there on a daily basis
16/01/2019, 12:23 - Sam;: Lol, fine. I retract my point
16/01/2019, 12:28 - Stefan;: Can't wait to get back to the good old days before we joined the EU
16/01/2019, 12:28 - Stefan;: When letterboxes were impracticably high and children knew their place
16/01/2019, 13:28 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
16/01/2019, 13:57 - Hamish Sinclair: "One of the most remarkable, and indeed excruciating, things about May has been her insistence on governing like she‚Äôs got a landslide majority. Why has no one told her...
Never has the intervention of a candid best mate been more needed. At some point in July 2017, surely Amber Rudd or whoever should have gone round and given May ‚ÄúThe Talk‚Äù. Along the lines of: ‚ÄúBabe, true friends tell you the truth, amirite? Because if no one else is going to say this, then I will: the referendum vote was problematically close anyway, and then you totally spaffed your majority. Like, you literally have no majority. So ‚Ä¶¬†"
16/01/2019, 14:54 - Damian Rumble: I am in San Fransisco at the moment and 8 hours behind.... Though I would be brewing up a 'Damian's rumblings' if I were back...

16/01/2019, 15:00 - Damian Rumble: I am waiting for the inevitable moment where Corbyn accidentally spends all of his pmqs frothing about a letter from "Phyllis" in Derby who is complaining about plans for a new by pass impinging on  human rights and totally forgets to hold the government to account....
16/01/2019, 15:30 - / James Ball: Letter boxes more important than brexit. Must be fully functional for when the ballot papers come

16/01/2019, 16:28 - Phill: YEEET
16/01/2019, 16:31 - Rob;: If the population ever plummets then can have *Crashing boars* as a headline
16/01/2019, 16:32 - Rob;: They can have that on me
16/01/2019, 16:45 - David;: Boaring but important?
16/01/2019, 17:05 - Rob;: Are you the chairman of the boars?
16/01/2019, 17:06 - David;: Boared Stupid
16/01/2019, 17:31 - Phill: Transcribed the whole Lose yourself Vs Brexit lyrics on the train home
16/01/2019, 17:32 - Phill: Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo
Her palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on her sweater already, Phillip's spaghetti
She's nervous, but on the surface she looks calm and ready
To drop amendments, but she keeps on forgettin'

She get vote down, the whole house gets so loud, she opens her mouth but her MPs won't come out. She's chokin now, everybody's joking now. The clocks run out, times up, cliff edge, blaow!

Snap back to reality, where's my nationality?
Oh, there goes Rees-Mogg, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows the whole backstory
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his ERG, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the Brexit, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the Brexit, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

Confidence escaping, through this hole that is gaping, the house is mine for the taking, 
make Boris king, as we move towards a new world order, An EU life is boring and it's close to post mortem.  
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
She blows us all over these MP's is all on her
Coast to coast negotiations, she's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, her  own cabinet
She goes home and barely knows her own ministers
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
Her back benchers don't want her no mo, she's cold product
The 1922 committee moved on to the next schmo who flows, she nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da. 

No more games, I'm a change what you call democracy, tear this mother fuckin single market up like two dogs raged, I was playing in the beginning, the moods all changed, May's been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage.
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next exit deal,
Best believe somebody's payin' 

All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my withdrawal agreement and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my Party 'cause man, these God damn back stops don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no free trade deal
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my constituents, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' prime minister and a remainer
Jeremy screamin' on and too much
But I've got to stay in one spot, another vote of no confidence or not
Juncker's gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot 'fore I end up in the EEA or shot,
Cross-party talks is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Europe, I love you, but we've got to go, I cannot go back on the referendums lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the Brexit, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

16/01/2019, 20:09 - Damian Rumble: So let me get this straight... The government has twice tried and failed to get it's flagship policy passed and has failed each time because MPs don't support the policy. However, brexiteers and labour have now twice tried the prime minister and the government and have twice failed because MPs broadly support the government. Soooo.. what now?
16/01/2019, 20:17 - David;: Cliff edge m8
16/01/2019, 20:40 - Rob;: Have you met Mr C Edge?

16/01/2019, 20:41 - David;: Have you met my mate Cliff? He's a bit edgy
16/01/2019, 20:42 - David;: Yes but Cliff is an actual name - makes it better
16/01/2019, 20:42 - David;: How many edges do you know?
16/01/2019, 20:42 - Rob;: Well yeah, Cliff was implied

16/01/2019, 20:42 - Rob;: Cliff Bino Edge
16/01/2019, 20:42 - David;: But you took out the part that was a real name
16/01/2019, 20:43 - David;: The only part
16/01/2019, 20:43 - Rob;: Yeah but I knew you knew it stood for Cliff
16/01/2019, 20:44 - David;: Well yeah. Okay. Allowed

19/01/2019, 14:27 - Rob;: Next year
19/01/2019, 14:28 - David;: Are you blaming underinvestment in the squad? Or millennial players who think they are bigger than the club
19/01/2019, 14:28 - Rob;: It's been a mix of everything
19/01/2019, 14:28 - Rob;: Has anyone watched the Sunderland Netflix documentary?

19/01/2019, 14:29 - David;: Great, can slide into that now
19/01/2019, 14:29 - Rob;: It's quite broad, not a lot on tactics etc, but you get to see a lot of how a club runs
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: It's great that the purpose of season one was to chart their glorious rise back to the prem
19/01/2019, 14:30 - David;: Lol
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: It's like the producers went
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Rob;: Yeah quite fun seeing their early optimism, but knowing what happens
19/01/2019, 14:30 - David;: But the old double relegation
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: "which club is most likely to come back up"
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: But then double relegation
19/01/2019, 14:31 - Phill: Which actually makes for more gripping TV
19/01/2019, 14:31 - Rob;: I love the slightly too well groomed CEO and his little espressos

19/01/2019, 16:41 - Rob;: Lord Palmerston can be Sir Cliff
19/01/2019, 16:49 - Damian Rumble: That feeling when you commit your wildcard to getting Salah in and he immediately repays you with a couple of goals...
19/01/2019, 16:53 - David;: Did you enjoy spending the 0.5m premium?
19/01/2019, 17:36 - David;: Feel like Rwanda have more pressing things to spend money on than a premier league arm band sponsorship
19/01/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: They got a lot of stick for it
19/01/2019, 17:45 - Rob;: The president even came out and defended it
19/01/2019, 17:45 - David;: Ha
19/01/2019, 17:46 - David;: I mean obviously tourism revenue is meant to pay for it. But seems a very costly and indirect route to that
19/01/2019, 17:46 - David;: Via the arsenal fan base
19/01/2019, 17:46 - Rob;: We may have been quite open to it
19/01/2019, 17:46 - Rob;: Africa is very much our commercial market
19/01/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: What's a little ethnic cleansing among friends?
19/01/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: I hear there's an excellent Hotel Rwanda
19/01/2019, 17:49 - David;: The only thing unifying the hutus and the tutsi's was their insistence that Wenger must go.
19/01/2019, 18:10 - Hamish Sinclair: That shoulder
19/01/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
19/01/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Sublime overhead kick? MISS
19/01/2019, 18:11 - Rob;: Accidental shoulder in the wrong direction? GOAL KLAXON
19/01/2019, 18:17 - David;: 50 goals a season, all with the perennium
19/01/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: Teh overhead perineum
19/01/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: Even penalties?
19/01/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: Dat run-up
19/01/2019, 18:25 - David;: Slides backwards into it. Amazing technique
19/01/2019, 18:25 - David;: So is Ozil dead to Emery?
19/01/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Hard to say. Emery is fairly inscrutable. It's either him attempting to discipline Ozil into being a more comitted, consistent player, or yeah, he's made up his mind that we can do without him
19/01/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Either way I can see him being moved on
19/01/2019, 18:34 - David;: Not sure who would pay his wages though
19/01/2019, 18:44 - Rob;: Yeah that may be a problem
19/01/2019, 18:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Really good segment in Thursday's football weekly about emery ozil
19/01/2019, 18:45 - Hamish Sinclair: They reckoned ozil is getting some of the fallout from his relationship with neymar at psg
19/01/2019, 18:46 - David;: Makes sense
19/01/2019, 18:46 - David;: So he hates the premadonna playmaker who won't press?
19/01/2019, 18:47 - Rob;: Think that makes sense too
19/01/2019, 18:47 - Phill: Don't get why people froth about Ozil not defending
19/01/2019, 18:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, but also having essentially lost his battle against neymar, he needs to prove he isn't weak in dealing with big player
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Needs to desperately prove he has the bigg3st swinging dick
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Phill: He's one of the best creative players in the world, who gives a fuck if he defends?
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Rob;: I don't think internally his defending is an issue, just consistency
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Gives the ball away a lot doesn't he?
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Phill: Yeah but the reason he's not consistent is because he's expected to defend and shit
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: I don't think that's true
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: He's had a free role his entire career at Arsenal
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Phill: "ooh mesut, get back you cunt, I don't care if it pulls you out of your best position which is to receive the ball in midfield after a breakdown and drive forwards"
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Literally no one is saying that
19/01/2019, 18:50 - David;: No but high pressing
19/01/2019, 18:51 - David;: I don't think it's that he doesn't cover ground but not good at actually winning balls back. The art of pressing to force a turnover
19/01/2019, 18:51 - Phill: https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11670/11475371/unai-emery-warns-mesut-ozil-every-player-must-defend-for-arsenal
19/01/2019, 18:52 - Hamish Sinclair: I know that teams, Liverpool for example have targeted him as he's weak in the tackle and prone to giving the ball away
19/01/2019, 18:52 - David;: Yeah, I think it's more that than 'lazy' as such
19/01/2019, 18:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Brendan Rodgers is on record as saying they targeted him in that 5:1 several years ago
19/01/2019, 18:52 - Phill: Ozil's best, most effective position, is to receive the ball, once a more defensive teammate has won the ball  and drive forwards
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Wouldn't work at Liverpool
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Would work at United
19/01/2019, 18:53 - David;: No, antithesis of a klopp player
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: And that's where he's always played for us
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Your manager has repeatedly said he needs to defend
19/01/2019, 18:54 - Phill: It's the same with Ramsey. Why is he being allowed to leave?
19/01/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: What's the same with him?
19/01/2019, 18:54 - Phill: Emery's/Arsenal's player management is garbage
19/01/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: The contract situations definitely are
19/01/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: I guess we'll see next season who Emery would actually like to play creative midfield. Would expect a signing
19/01/2019, 18:55 - Phill: Do you feel Emery is hamstrung by the failings of the board?
19/01/2019, 18:56 - David;: I feel you have a decently balanced squad
19/01/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Definitely not being very good on contracts the last 5 years or so
19/01/2019, 18:56 - David;: But not a clear identity
19/01/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Apart from defence, we need some quality it the middle to replace Koscielny now he's old
19/01/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: But mostly it's fine
19/01/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: A summer transfer window should hopefully help
19/01/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/Football_LDN/status/1086709509635100673?s=19
19/01/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: The nutcracker suite
19/01/2019, 23:10 - David;: Solskjaer - the garden gnome
19/01/2019, 23:16 - Rob;: That Cardiff player doesn't know how to take a point blank ball to the bonce
19/01/2019, 23:18 - David;: You know. Should have a word
19/01/2019, 23:20 - Rob;: Would love it if that was a huge skill that compensated for everything else
19/01/2019, 23:21 - Rob;: Like Roary Delap only being good at throwing
19/01/2019, 23:21 - Rob;: I'd get subbed on for the last 10 mins just to Jake a bonce blow
19/01/2019, 23:30 - David;: Bonce blow for toon
20/01/2019, 12:54 - David;: When did Wagner get sacked? Missed that
20/01/2019, 12:54 - David;: Hoping for the bounce
20/01/2019, 12:54 - Sam;: He left. Burnt out
20/01/2019, 12:54 - David;: Resigned? You don't see that these days
20/01/2019, 12:55 - Sam;: Yeah. Just couldn‚Äôt do it anymore
20/01/2019, 12:57 - David;: Can you have a bounce before the new manager comes in?
20/01/2019, 12:57 - Rob;: Can the bounce exist if it wasn't a sacking?
20/01/2019, 12:58 - David;: Yeah yeah, you always get a bounce
20/01/2019, 12:58 - David;: A free one
20/01/2019, 12:58 - Rob;: Like the elder wand not working if it's last owner wasn't overcome
20/01/2019, 17:24 - David;: Ah. So Sunderland till I die. Deliberate policy of buying players with an injury record
20/01/2019, 17:24 - David;: Going to end well
20/01/2019, 17:27 - David;: Also they've got the parachute payments and huge stadium but seem to be operating on a shoestring
20/01/2019, 18:11 - David;: Them throwing away the 3-1 lead at Brentford is a highlight
20/01/2019, 23:15 - David;: Rodwell seems a real cunt
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: Got this spam work email this morning selling reinforced doors
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: This is their advertising angle
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: Powerful stuff
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: <Media omitted>
21/01/2019, 10:08 - Sam;: That inferno. So chill. No panic, door is reinforced üëåüèªüëçüèª
21/01/2019, 10:21 - Rob;: Dead of night outside
21/01/2019, 10:21 - Rob;: No worries
21/01/2019, 10:21 - Rob;: Time to draw
21/01/2019, 11:09 - / James Ball: Also, they appear to be windows, not doors. The advertising team fell at the first hurdle.

21/01/2019, 16:46 - Hamish Sinclair: And are people bringing other halves? Or will we mostly be shitting and looking at tits?
21/01/2019, 16:52 - / James Ball: I second Hamish. I'm on the dry January but I'm up for an old school froust if one's occurring
21/01/2019, 16:52 - Phill: Becca is coming, she's keen on the froust
21/01/2019, 16:52 - Phill: She's desensitised to it now
21/01/2019, 16:55 - Rob;: Julia's coming, probably just for the party and after, not the pre-froust
21/01/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: I can either get a taxi back to my parents with her and maybe Calum, or all of us back to Casa Yarrow
21/01/2019, 16:57 - Sam;: On Saturday night, are you up lot up for a Chinese at mine before heading out?

21/01/2019, 17:14 - David;: Yeah so my house is free all weekend, I'm thinking convene in chippy Saturday morning, get the bus over to banners for the evening and split a taxi back.
21/01/2019, 17:15 - David;: Judith requests duvet covers so she doesn't have to wash stuff. Plenty of beds.

21/01/2019, 17:17 - Phill: Who's going to book cabs? Anyone know any good ones?

23/01/2019, 17:06 - Phill: Then he was just like ah no
23/01/2019, 17:06 - Phill: Although the staff handbook says I might, if requested have to do a medical. So I'm off the weed for a bit
23/01/2019, 17:06 - Phill: ‚òπ
23/01/2019, 17:07 - Phill: But I'm guessing that's more for old shit munchers who they think might need occupational health etc
23/01/2019, 17:08 - Rob;: Yeah surely
23/01/2019, 17:08 - Rob;: Would it necessarily even include a drugs test?
23/01/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: I had a great notice day at the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. They were well butthurt cause it was only after 8 months. I explained I was off to an oscar-winning animation company, which was a bit of a dream, for more money too and they were just like 'but the Institute is VERY prestigious. We hope to have our own TV channel'. Fucked off to Blaen Y Cwm the next day. That feel.
23/01/2019, 17:10 - Rob;: We'd all watch a Materials, Minerals and Mining TV channel I'm sure
23/01/2019, 17:11 - Phill: I doubt it tbh. But better to not risk it.
23/01/2019, 17:12 - Phill: Once I've got a feel for it I'll be back honking I'm sure
23/01/2019, 17:13 - David;: Will buy any of that stuff from you if looking to offload
23/01/2019, 17:14 - David;: Take away the temptation.
23/01/2019, 17:21 - Phill: All gone unfortunately
23/01/2019, 17:22 - Phill: Been living off dregs the past few days too so good timing
23/01/2019, 17:36 - Sam;: Listening to how Southgate has ‚Äòtaken the weight out of the shirt‚Äô. Such a heavy shirt
23/01/2019, 17:39 - David;: 'Someone had been stitching iron into collars for years. That was the first thing I changed.'
23/01/2019, 21:54 - David;: Easy to forget about pears
23/01/2019, 21:54 - David;: Strong fruit
23/01/2019, 22:10 - Paul;: Shit tier fruit
23/01/2019, 22:11 - David;: Nah
23/01/2019, 22:12 - Sam;: Please illuminate us on the tiers  of fruit
23/01/2019, 22:13 - Paul;: God tier - apple, little orange ones
23/01/2019, 22:13 - Paul;: Great tier - pineapple, peach
23/01/2019, 22:14 - Paul;: Middle tier - large orange ones
23/01/2019, 22:14 - Paul;: Dump tier - banana
23/01/2019, 22:15 - Paul;: Shit tier - melon, pear
23/01/2019, 22:22 - David;: > 'orange ones'
23/01/2019, 22:23 - David;: So correct on melon, banana, pineapple, oranges. The apple sits astride them all as king. But peach can fuck off and pear is close to apple
23/01/2019, 22:23 - Sam;: Does that mean an orange or are you talking about a tangerine?
23/01/2019, 22:23 - Paul;: The varieties of orange citrus fruits but not necessarily an orange
23/01/2019, 22:23 - Sam;: Or a nectarine
23/01/2019, 22:23 - David;: Pear just has a less good PR department
23/01/2019, 22:24 - David;: I hope you're not limping the grapefruit in there because that would be inexcusable
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Melons are the biggest piece of shit
23/01/2019, 22:24 - David;: *lumping
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Grapes are high up
23/01/2019, 22:24 - David;: Yeah, fuck melons
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Grapefruit only good with sugar which discounts it
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt be consumed solo
23/01/2019, 22:25 - Paul;: Lemon is versatile and great but can‚Äôt just munch it
23/01/2019, 22:26 - David;: Fucking peach. It's limp arse shitty flesh
23/01/2019, 22:26 - David;: Can't look after itself. High maintenance
23/01/2019, 22:27 - David;: All berries are too much faff
23/01/2019, 22:27 - Paul;: A good peach if prepared right can be up there
23/01/2019, 22:27 - David;: And I include the strawberry in that
23/01/2019, 22:28 - Paul;: Too much can go wrong with a strawberry
23/01/2019, 22:28 - David;: Lol
23/01/2019, 22:34 - Stefan;: How have you left out the almighty mango
23/01/2019, 22:34 - Paul;: Mango is shit
23/01/2019, 22:35 - Paul;: Again the texture is hit and miss
23/01/2019, 22:35 - David;: Can be great under very specific circumstances
23/01/2019, 22:35 - Stefan;: Mango can fuck your shitty peach into next week
23/01/2019, 22:35 - David;: A precision tool
23/01/2019, 22:35 - Paul;: Dried mango however now you‚Äôre talking but that‚Äôs a conversion to the original fruit so void
23/01/2019, 22:36 - David;: Dried would need a whole different ranking scale
23/01/2019, 22:36 - Stefan;: Apricots - underwhelming in their natural state, but world-beating dried
23/01/2019, 22:36 - Paul;: And create incredible gas
23/01/2019, 22:37 - David;: Make you shit everywhere
23/01/2019, 22:37 - David;: The raisin is a debasement of the grape
23/01/2019, 22:37 - Paul;: Sullied the grape
23/01/2019, 23:26 - Hamish Sinclair: I can confirm this
24/01/2019, 06:08 - Phill: All I can say is fucking kek...
24/01/2019, 06:08 - Phill: >apples
24/01/2019, 06:09 - Phill: >no plum
24/01/2019, 06:09 - Phill: >melon that far down....
24/01/2019, 06:10 - Phill: You spastic?
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Phill: >no cloudberry
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Phill: >no berries full stop.
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Phill: 0/10 list, would not Schindler
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Rob;: Nah but in an oatmeal cookie, or porridge. A revelation
24/01/2019, 07:35 - Rob;: Raspberry, blueberry, no faff
24/01/2019, 07:35 - Phill: Famously no faff. No cutting. No peeling. Just gumping.
24/01/2019, 07:36 - Rob;: Yeah the least faff of all fruit
24/01/2019, 07:37 - Phill: The only thing an apple is good for is it's juice. It's flesh can fucking die.
24/01/2019, 07:43 - Rob;: Cooking it improves it - apple sauce, or caramelised apple
24/01/2019, 07:43 - Rob;: But cooking improves almost all fruit. Fight me
24/01/2019, 07:45 - Phill: All juice related. Cooking concentrates and caramelises the juice. The flesh of the apple is just a shit vessel.
24/01/2019, 07:45 - Phill: Without the juice the apple would be nothing. Like Garfunkel without Simon.
24/01/2019, 07:46 - Rob;: A juiceless fruit
24/01/2019, 07:46 - Rob;: That's a nut
24/01/2019, 07:46 - Phill: Banana.
24/01/2019, 07:47 - Rob;: A terrible fruit
24/01/2019, 07:47 - Phill: Burn, scrub.
24/01/2019, 07:48 - Phill: God Tier: all fruit except those listed in other tiers. 
Tolerable tier: oranges. 



Shit tier: apples.
24/01/2019, 07:49 - Phill: I would put grapes in tolerable tier, but can't because wine.
24/01/2019, 07:50 - Phill: There's a reason we gump apple and orange juice. Protip: it's because theyre a dry hump of a whole fruit.
24/01/2019, 07:50 - Rob;: The boisonberry sounds like a Blane Bloomy sort of berry
24/01/2019, 07:53 - Phill: >not gumping bucket loads of cloudberries foraged from the forests of Scandinavia

24/01/2019, 10:38 - Rob;: I'd like to poor hot piss all over the tomato is a fruit bullshit. If you start bringing scientific classifications of plant parts into it then suddenly nothing can be a vegetable, barely and fruits are fruits, and a watermelon is technically a Garibaldi
24/01/2019, 10:39 - Rob;: Fruit and veg are fluid categories based on taste and use
24/01/2019, 10:39 - Rob;: Tomatoes are eaten like a vegetable in savoury dishes most of the time and are not a fruit in any meaningful way
24/01/2019, 10:40 - Paul;: Fuck tomato being a fruit
24/01/2019, 10:40 - Paul;: Fuck right off
24/01/2019, 10:41 - Paul;: Only goes well with basil, balsamic, oil and mozzarella- I will not consume it in any other fashion apart from maybe on top of a pizza.
24/01/2019, 10:46 - Phill: >maybe on top of a pizza
24/01/2019, 10:46 - Phill: >What is base sauce

24/01/2019, 10:49 - David;: Chile's, spaghetti bol. Well the list is endless.
24/01/2019, 10:50 - / James Ball: Baby plum though not a fuck off beef tomato
24/01/2019, 10:51 - Phill: Why we even slating the tomato? If it turned its back on us we'd be fucked. Underrated.
24/01/2019, 10:51 - Phill: Leave the tomato out of this.
24/01/2019, 10:51 - David;: Yeah it's veg. Neutral
24/01/2019, 10:52 - David;: Next you'll be having a go at the onion
24/01/2019, 10:53 - / James Ball: My ex girlfriend hated onions and garlic - cooking was difficult
24/01/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: I'm not blaming tomato
24/01/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Just don't bring them into this
24/01/2019, 10:57 - / James Ball: Amendment:
Tomato > not counted.
24/01/2019, 10:58 - / James Ball: Sultanas and raisins? Fruit?

24/01/2019, 11:03 - Phill: SHIT TIER
24/01/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: Raisin as an ingredient = good. Solo is shit tier
24/01/2019, 11:06 - / James Ball: Strongly disagree. Sultanas in curries pretty disappointing
24/01/2019, 11:06 - David;: Even as ingriedient I always hate it. Adds nothing
24/01/2019, 11:07 - David;: 'you've got a lovely sugary treat there. Do you want me to put a chewy, stringy savoury ball of shit in the middle that will monopolise everything?'
24/01/2019, 11:08 - David;: Thanks but no thanks
24/01/2019, 11:08 - Rob;: But the oat and raisin cookie
24/01/2019, 11:08 - David;: No
24/01/2019, 11:08 - Rob;: My favourite cookie
24/01/2019, 11:09 - Paul;: Rob your tastebuds are all over the place
24/01/2019, 11:09 - / James Ball: chocolate chip > oat and rasin
24/01/2019, 11:10 - Paul;: Those stupid fucking Moroccan dishes they ruin with currants. Will not eat
24/01/2019, 11:11 - Rob;: Agree not a fan of them in savoury food
24/01/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: You seem to be colluding heavily with currants though. I don‚Äôt trust it

24/01/2019, 13:04 - David;: Citrus in any context apart from mexican, puddings or G+T is wrong

25/01/2019, 17:00 - David;: But i'm not feeding any data into the bullshit engine apart from encrypted messages. You can't optimise nothing.

25/01/2019, 18:22 - / James Ball: If you want to fuck up the advertisers there's an addon for most browsers called adnauseum that registers clicks with all adverts so the advertisers have no way of profiling you - "he clicks on everything"
25/01/2019, 18:36 - Damian Rumble: Not sure why you want to avoid being profiled... The whole point of our ad targeting algorithms is to ensure you don't get shown ads you don't want to see. Having something like will just ensure that you keep seeing irrelevant and annoying material
25/01/2019, 18:37 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
25/01/2019, 18:38 - Damian Rumble: Also I went to weed shop styled like a apple store in Nevada and legally bought a joint. It was great.
25/01/2019, 18:46 - / James Ball: I don't get shown ads because I have adblockers on everything anyway. So, see no ads and also don't allow a third party to build up a profile
25/01/2019, 18:51 - Paul;: Damo = zucks cuck

26/01/2019, 00:46 - Damian Rumble: Idiots and dillusional. You can't escape the big data revolution unless you are willing to go and live under a rock.

31/01/2019, 11:40 - Paul;: Or has he always been the caretaker
31/01/2019, 11:42 - David;: Caretaker
31/01/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: If he gets top four surely he has to get the job right Sambo?
31/01/2019, 11:45 - Paul;: I don‚Äôt understand why they wouldn‚Äôt keep him on
31/01/2019, 11:46 - Paul;: Mark Hughes too rich for his shoes. How long ago was that?
31/01/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: 2008-9
31/01/2019, 12:13 - Sam;: It works both ways for them to do caretaker first. If he was shit - only caretaker. If this suddenly turns to shit now - only CT. but being CT takes pressure off him. 

The only worry now is the di Matteo effect if he gets the job
31/01/2019, 12:13 - Phill: Great little long read on BBC news about this guy who became a house MC in the 80's called Hooligan X and then tried to ship tonnes of weed from the Lebanon

31/01/2019, 15:16 - Rob;: Yannick Bolasie not proving to have been a great ¬£25m investment for Everton
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: He was so good at Palace before they signed him
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Got a massive injury in his first season there
31/01/2019, 15:17 - Rob;: Yeah a Fantasy favourite then
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Never came back
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Yeah - and just great direct wing play
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Rated him
31/01/2019, 15:18 - Rob;: Football would be great if injuries were eliminated. Just full potential everywhere, all the time
31/01/2019, 15:18 - Rob;: Smaller squads as a result, so talent more evenly distributed
31/01/2019, 15:19 - David;: Also he wears black boots
31/01/2019, 15:19 - David;: That instantly adds 20% to my estimation of a player

01/02/2019, 11:32 - / James Ball: I can't do goat's cheese any more. Tastes too much like rancid farm.

01/02/2019, 11:40 - Phill: Yes James. I'm the same. Fucking putrid shit.

01/02/2019, 11:45 - Phill: >readily gumping hormonal sludge
01/02/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: That 'it's not natural' argument is bollocks. We evolved lactase to digest it. Evolution takes ages. Anything that's evolved is definitely natural
01/02/2019, 11:49 - / James Ball: I'm all for cheese and diary. Just not goat
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: You can be disgusted by modern dairy farming, but there's nothing more normal for a northern European to be doing than locking their lips round a cow's tit
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Phill: Which is why almost 70% of people lose their ability to effectively digest lactose after infancy? NEXT
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Not true
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: You plebs should go back to your babybel and dairylee
01/02/2019, 11:50 - Phill: Approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, affecting more than 90 percent of adults in some of these communities. Lactose intolerance is also very common in people of West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent

01/02/2019, 11:50 - Phill: NEXT
01/02/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Reduced is different to ineffective
01/02/2019, 11:50 - Phill: No
01/02/2019, 11:51 - / James Ball: Babybel yes, dairylee no
01/02/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: Obviously no need to be as effective as when you only drink milk as a baby
01/02/2019, 11:51 - / James Ball: Asians also have the defective alcohol gene right? So they can't breakdown alcohol? Sucks to be Asian
01/02/2019, 11:51 - Phill: My sperm count is reduced. My penis is ineffective.
01/02/2019, 11:52 - / James Ball: Give them a baileys and really fuck them up
01/02/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: Ineffective is an absolute,  term, a reduction can be of any amount
01/02/2019, 11:52 - Phill: No
01/02/2019, 11:53 - Phill: It can be extremely ineffective or mildly ineffective
01/02/2019, 11:53 - / James Ball: Yeah, I'd say ineffective is relative rather than absolute
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(17)30154-1/fulltext
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: My leg came off. I‚Äôm now mildly ineffective at football
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: Here's another dairy study recently published in the Lancet
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: DYOR
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: There is a reduction in your effectiveness
01/02/2019, 11:55 - Phill: In summary:
01/02/2019, 11:55 - Phill: Lactose malabsorption is widespread in most of the world, with wide variation between different regions and an overall frequency of around two-thirds of the world's population. Acknowledging regional patterns of lactose malabsorption is important to guide management of gastrointestinal symptoms.
01/02/2019, 11:56 - Phill: Brb. Need to get my cheese on toast out the grill
01/02/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: That 60% figure is worldwide, most non Europeans haven't evolved to retain adult lactose. I specifically said northern European
01/02/2019, 11:56 - / James Ball: Dairy free cheese I hope
01/02/2019, 11:57 - Paul;: Dairylee on toast
01/02/2019, 11:57 - Paul;: Grilled
01/02/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: That study is true, and it's also true that Europeans can deal with lactose much better than any other group
01/02/2019, 11:58 - Phill: The figure for Northern Europe is still a third. A significant amount. 3 of us in this thread are ineffective at turning it into normal shit.
01/02/2019, 11:59 - Paul;: Sam can‚Äôt deal with dairy
01/02/2019, 11:59 - Sam;: I‚Äôm not having this
01/02/2019, 12:00 - Sam;: It‚Äôs only when packed on booze
01/02/2019, 12:00 - / James Ball: I admit that I avoid whole milk and cream in things cos it can make me feel a bit sick if I have loads
01/02/2019, 12:00 - / James Ball: No problem with cheese though
01/02/2019, 12:00 - Sam;: Don‚Äôt use me to fight your dairy war
01/02/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: üéµ Sam Sam the lactose man üé∂ - it‚Äôs what all the kids sing
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Rob;: I think there are many good reasons to cut down on dairy, but the idea that it's unatural isn't one for me
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Sam;: Shitting out his guts into Paul‚Äôs bed pan
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Phill: Eating meat is also unnatural because we don't have evolved canines. Come at me.
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: Would you eat cobwebs rob? Just suck them out a spiders tit?
01/02/2019, 12:02 - Rob;: Not unatural as we depend on vitamin b12, of which there's no plant-source your body is able to access

01/02/2019, 12:04 - Paul;: Lol
01/02/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: Like an 80 year old
01/02/2019, 12:04 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 12:05 - / James Ball: We don't have enormous canines but then nor do many omnivores. Also we evolved cooking so don't need to bite off hunks of raw meat
01/02/2019, 12:06 - Phill: Lol "evolved cooking"
01/02/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Exactly, so we need to cook it to eat it. A true carnivore could eat it raw.
01/02/2019, 12:08 - Phill: Rob if you're so meat, go to Tesco and buy some raw chicken and pork and just eat it and see what happens. NEXT
01/02/2019, 12:09 - / James Ball: We're not carnivores though
01/02/2019, 12:09 - Phill: So why we eating meat?
01/02/2019, 12:09 - / James Ball: Omnivores innit
01/02/2019, 12:09 - / James Ball: Bit of everything
01/02/2019, 12:09 - Phill: Don't buy it. It's a term created by the liberal media.
01/02/2019, 12:11 - Rob;: I like how you've worked your self into a situation where you're invoking right-wing rhetoric to defend your left-wing position
01/02/2019, 12:12 - Rob;: You should probably be used in schools to improve debating skills
01/02/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: How to argue with someone who's position is constantly shifting based on an algorithm designed to annoy you as much as it can
01/02/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: *whose
01/02/2019, 12:15 - Phill: Would be great to just fake news everyone into quitting smoking, reducing drinking, eating more veg, doing more exercise
01/02/2019, 12:16 - Phill: It should be the NHS new aggressive marketing company for healthy living
01/02/2019, 12:16 - Phill: Campaign*
01/02/2019, 12:17 - Phill: Also you can get enough b12 from mushrooms.
01/02/2019, 12:17 - Phill: next...
01/02/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: 0% b12
01/02/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: So the aims are good, but the logic, facts and arguments are incorrect and exhausting?
01/02/2019, 12:19 - / James Ball: I can confirm I passively lost about 1.5-2kg from dry January.
01/02/2019, 12:20 - / James Ball: Or at least, during January
01/02/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: But how many friends?
01/02/2019, 12:20 - / James Ball: Passively or actively?
01/02/2019, 12:21 - Sam;: Lol. actively. Fuk off m8
01/02/2019, 12:24 - Phill: NO
01/02/2019, 12:24 - Phill: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 12:27 - Phill: Precisely
01/02/2019, 12:27 - Phill: Just pound them into submission
01/02/2019, 12:28 - Phill: Also, the facts arguments I have presented today are not incorrect.
01/02/2019, 12:28 - Phill: Just FYI.
01/02/2019, 12:36 - Paul;: Supported by scientific journals
01/02/2019, 12:37 - Paul;: But he‚Äôs still a dairylee eating non tastebud having heretic
01/02/2019, 12:40 - Phill: At the end of the day
01/02/2019, 12:40 - Phill: >goats cheese.
01/02/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: Relatively high is misleading here. The recommended daily intake of b12 is about 2 micrograms, if umfresh shiitake mushrooms contain at most 13 _milli_ grams per 100, that's only 0.013 micrograms. To get the recommended 2 micrograms you would need to eat 15.7kg of fresh shiitake mushrooms per day
01/02/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: Which perhaps you are
01/02/2019, 12:42 - / James Ball: Micrograms are smaller than milligrams
01/02/2019, 12:42 - / James Ball: 13 milligrams = 1300 micrograms
01/02/2019, 12:43 - / James Ball: Or 13000
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Phill: Yeah we take drugs in miligrams
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Ah yeah lol
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Still, shiitake mushrooms very specific
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Would be much easier just to take supplements
01/02/2019, 12:56 - / James Ball: I'm growing some mushrooms currently

01/02/2019, 12:58 - Phill: We bought some spawn and I went to Costa and asked for their waste grinds
01/02/2019, 12:58 - Phill: Grew a load

01/02/2019, 23:10 - Sam;: Total destruction
01/02/2019, 23:10 - David;: The best thing is all the hope they invest in Coleman as the saviour
01/02/2019, 23:11 - David;: Also when Rodwell is on 70000 a week, not training but refuses to leave so they're laying off vital first team players to cover his wages.
01/02/2019, 23:12 - Sam;: Yeah. Really shows him up to just be sold school ‚Äòmotivator‚Äô type.
01/02/2019, 23:12 - David;: Yeah, he changes nothing
01/02/2019, 23:12 - Sam;: Yeah rodwell. Just trolling. But then again they gave him the contract
01/02/2019, 23:13 - Sam;: Fuck. Robson signed a 19 yr old Ronaldo from PSV
01/02/2019, 23:14 - David;: They're not even guaranteed promotion this season. Currently 5th or so.
01/02/2019, 23:14 - Sam;: Big call
01/02/2019, 23:14 - David;: Ah yeah. Did football
01/02/2019, 23:14 - David;: The pre-injury Ronaldo was mental
01/02/2019, 23:15 - Sam;: Minor sub plot is mourinho as interpreter
01/02/2019, 23:16 - David;: Didn't he claim some sort of influence to ingratiate himself to the English press?
01/02/2019, 23:19 - Sam;: Haven‚Äôt heard that myself. But it turns out robson insisted that mourinho be his assistant. Way more than helping with his Spanish
01/02/2019, 23:42 - David;: Selling your lead goalscorer in January. Classic move
02/02/2019, 10:49 - Rob;: I loved how unsympathetic Grabban is about it
02/02/2019, 10:50 - Rob;: Just like 'fuck them, I wanted out'
02/02/2019, 10:55 - Phill: Been watching this average comedy on BBC called Cuckoo, but there is one great character in it called Steve. Probably in my too five characters of all time.
02/02/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: I watched series one, surprised it's still going
02/02/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: Is Steve the little one
02/02/2019, 10:57 - Phill: Yeah Steve chance
02/02/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: He is good
02/02/2019, 10:57 - Phill: His character has only improved since series 1. Series 5 now.
02/02/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: I watched a bit of one series where they kidnap or try to kill him or something
02/02/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: And couldn't work out how things had escalated to that point
02/02/2019, 10:58 - Phill: Would recommend watching more, if only for Steve.
02/02/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: Are you watching Catastrophe? I'm quite sad this is the last series
02/02/2019, 10:59 - Phill: Nah but heard good things might watch later
02/02/2019, 11:00 - Phill: Off to see the Mappa Mundi today.

02/02/2019, 13:10 - David;: Just a plain unseeded bun. No sauce
02/02/2019, 13:11 - Phill: <Media omitted>
02/02/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: No bun just meat
02/02/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: Bread get bun
02/02/2019, 13:22 - Rob;: It is great, but only with classic beef
02/02/2019, 13:22 - Rob;: Hate it when they pair it with any vaguely burger-esque thing just because it's trendy
02/02/2019, 13:22 - Paul;: It‚Äôs just a show off no one was asking for
02/02/2019, 13:23 - Rob;: Our work pub does a chip butty with a brioche bun. That's completely unnecessary. If you're having a chip butty you just want cheap white bread. It's grotty food on purpose
02/02/2019, 13:24 - David;: Halloumi in brioche
02/02/2019, 13:24 - David;: I'd rather eat shit
02/02/2019, 13:24 - Paul;: Having a brioche bun = how to be pleb

02/02/2019, 13:42 - David;: Yeah, embarassing

02/02/2019, 16:27 - Phill: Nutmeg is a classic ingredient in bechamel sauce you fucking pleb
02/02/2019, 16:27 - Paul;: They‚Äôve been making it wrong
02/02/2019, 16:27 - Paul;: Or should never make it again
02/02/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: Nutmeg will get you high if you have enough
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: Kill you if you have too much
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Damian Rumble: Do you remember that time I did the nutmeg challenge?
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: Not the cinnamon challenge
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: ?
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Damian Rumble: Chundered everywhere
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: No, I remember Bruce Lee in WAY of the dragon
02/02/2019, 16:31 - Phill: I no remember that
02/02/2019, 16:32 - David;: Did this happen?
02/02/2019, 16:32 - Paul;: >7
02/02/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: Was definitely cinnamon
02/02/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: At Dave's I think
02/02/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: Ages ago
02/02/2019, 16:38 - Damian Rumble: Nah it was at my enstone house
02/02/2019, 16:39 - Damian Rumble: Probably was cinnamon thoug
02/02/2019, 16:39 - Damian Rumble: Think nutmeg was a different occasion, outside of the froust
02/02/2019, 16:41 - Rob;: How much did you have?
02/02/2019, 16:41 - Rob;: The lethal dose isn't that high
02/02/2019, 16:41 - Damian Rumble: Let's go England. Just about the only time a feel even remotely patriotic these days...

02/02/2019, 20:51 - David;: Are you down chasers?
02/02/2019, 20:52 - Paul;: Yeah chasers
02/02/2019, 20:58 - Paul;: Damian suggests a Lake District cottage froust at some point
02/02/2019, 21:00 - David;: Yeah I rate kendal
02/02/2019, 21:01 - Paul;: Phil and I once stayed in this great village at the base of hellvellyn. Lots of frousting pubs and big mountains

03/02/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Or not at least for ones with double gameweeks - Aguero only has 17 for Dave
03/02/2019, 21:48 - Damian Rumble: He doesn't need anymore points
04/02/2019, 01:07 - David;: It's weird, it doesn't seem to double it on the players icon but it has in my overall point tally

04/02/2019, 20:24 - David;: Makes up for the penno against leicester
04/02/2019, 20:24 - Jack G;: Doesn‚Äôt help us though
04/02/2019, 20:24 - Jack G;: Bad logic
04/02/2019, 20:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Why do you need 3points?
04/02/2019, 20:25 - Jack G;: Why follow football if I don‚Äôt want us to win?
04/02/2019, 20:25 - Jack G;: What‚Äôs the point
04/02/2019, 20:25 - David;: Evens itself out over the season
04/02/2019, 20:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Of west ham?
04/02/2019, 20:28 - Jack G;: üñï
04/02/2019, 20:28 - David;: Weeeeel
04/02/2019, 20:29 - David;: Ruined it with the Gangnam celebration
04/02/2019, 20:29 - David;: Shouldn't even count
04/02/2019, 20:29 - Jack G;: 0-0 then
04/02/2019, 20:29 - Jack G;: Restart match
04/02/2019, 20:30 - Hamish Sinclair: We still need the points more
04/02/2019, 20:30 - Jack G;: I don‚Äôt care
04/02/2019, 20:30 - Jack G;: Got to earn it
04/02/2019, 20:31 - David;: Would you want City to win the league? Souless gulf state cunts.
04/02/2019, 20:32 - Hamish Sinclair: The City Corporation
04/02/2019, 20:32 - Jack G;: Nah I‚Äôd prefer you guys to win it but I‚Äôm not going to stop supporting West Ham for this game
04/02/2019, 20:32 - Hamish Sinclair: That seems fair
04/02/2019, 20:33 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd still prefer it if youbhave us the points though
04/02/2019, 20:33 - Jack G;: You‚Äôll win anyway tbh, can‚Äôt see us holding out
04/02/2019, 20:55 - David;: Lol the Liam Neeson thing
04/02/2019, 20:56 - David;: '"I went up and down areas with a cosh, hoping I'd be approached by somebody - I'm ashamed to say that - and I did it for maybe a week, hoping some [uses air quotes with fingers] 'black bastard' would come out of a pub and have a go at me about something, you know? So that I could kill him."'
04/02/2019, 20:56 - David;: Cant come back from that surely
04/02/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Odd to offer that voluntarily
04/02/2019, 21:02 - Paul;: When did this happen?
04/02/2019, 21:02 - David;: Just now
04/02/2019, 21:02 - Rob;: There's some context...
04/02/2019, 21:03 - David;: Keep schtum about the old lyncing impulse surely?

04/02/2019, 21:03 - Rob;: Decades ago
04/02/2019, 21:03 - Paul;: Last Friday down chasers
04/02/2019, 21:04 - David;: Not far enough back that murder was acceptable though
04/02/2019, 21:05 - Rob;: Just accidentally telling the independent that
04/02/2019, 21:06 - David;: Yeah lol, in a light promotional interview
04/02/2019, 21:06 - Rob;: His publicist will be furious
04/02/2019, 21:06 - David;: Got a new film out, very excited. By the way I used to have intense violent race hatred.
04/02/2019, 21:07 - Rob;: 'I feel it was important not to be typecast as a murderous antihero. Also, did I mention the time I premeditated a revenge murder?'
04/02/2019, 21:09 - Rob;: Made far worse by how clear he is that he'd have murdered anyone so long as they were black
04/02/2019, 21:10 - David;: Yeah
04/02/2019, 21:10 - David;: Classic thing not to say publically
04/02/2019, 21:11 - Rob;: In a literally documented situation

05/02/2019, 12:54 - Damian Rumble: Just reading this Liam neeson story. Insane that he didn't that and even more insane that years later he decided to tell the world's media about it completely unprovoked...
05/02/2019, 13:30 - David;: Or could it have something to do with the injuries to 4 first team players?
05/02/2019, 13:32 - Jack G;: No excuse. We‚Äôve got 6 first team injuries
05/02/2019, 13:33 - Jack G;: Arnautovic, Nasri, Balbuena, Yarmolenko, Lanzini, Wilshere
05/02/2019, 13:44 - David;: Well actually we also have 6 including Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lovren
05/02/2019, 13:44 - David;: So there
05/02/2019, 13:45 - Jack G;: Fair play
05/02/2019, 13:45 - David;: But 4 recent injuries to first Xi players: Gomez, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Trent
05/02/2019, 13:45 - David;: Would all normally start
05/02/2019, 13:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Also the timing is quite important. Henderson and wijnaldum were withdrawn last minute
05/02/2019, 13:46 - Jack G;: Wijnaldum was the biggest miss last night imo
05/02/2019, 13:46 - David;: Agreed
05/02/2019, 13:46 - Sam;: Good to let Nathaniel Clyne go.. Milner was shocking at right back
05/02/2019, 13:47 - Jack G;: Couldn‚Äôt deal with Mr. Anderson
05/02/2019, 13:47 - David;: Yeah. Unfortunate that Trent got injured the week after we decided to do that. But an unecessary risk.
05/02/2019, 13:47 - David;: Thing is usually Gomez can cover it but then he is also injured.
05/02/2019, 13:48 - David;: And Fabinho can also cover it but he is needed in centre mid due to sudden injureis to Hendo and Gini.
05/02/2019, 13:48 - David;: So in theory we still have 2 good covers but been fucked over by other injuries.
05/02/2019, 13:49 - Paul;: No squad depth
05/02/2019, 13:50 - Paul;: One trick pony
05/02/2019, 13:51 - David;: But 2 covers for a position. Very standard, City would not have more than that
05/02/2019, 13:51 - Jack G;: I did enjoy Clyne turning down the opportunity to play for Warnock
05/02/2019, 13:54 - Sam;: Injuries? You‚Äôve thrown the two cup competitions so a clear run at the prem with CL as a bonus
05/02/2019, 13:54 - Sam;: Spurs to win. City third. They‚Äôre still  in all four comps
05/02/2019, 13:55 - Jack G;: Please no
05/02/2019, 13:55 - Jack G;: They still have to play pool, city and Chelsea away. Plus a north London derby
05/02/2019, 13:56 - Paul;: Spurs win trolls rob for added bonus troll

05/02/2019, 14:03 - Jack G;: Overreaction
05/02/2019, 14:06 - David;: It's fine, they need their little narrative. The smaller clubs like United need something to hang onto.
05/02/2019, 14:10 - Sam;: We‚Äôll see on February 24th.
05/02/2019, 14:11 - Jack G;: That will be a spicy match
05/02/2019, 14:12 - Paul;: West Ham languishing in 12th. Embarrassing
05/02/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: Thanks
05/02/2019, 14:26 - Rob;: That's got to be quite high got modern West Ham hasn't it?
05/02/2019, 14:29 - Phill: Wut?
05/02/2019, 14:29 - Jack G;: Decent, especially considering we‚Äôre 2 points off 8th? We‚Äôre generally bottom half except than Payet season where we were somehow in the top 4 race until 3 games before the end of the season. Same season Leicester won

05/02/2019, 14:33 - Sam;: One win in five
05/02/2019, 14:34 - Jack G;: Yeah but that win was against arsenal üëå
05/02/2019, 14:35 - Jack G;: Won 6/7 games in December before that

07/02/2019, 13:08 - David;: Evidence that nerves are an issue? Oh that's right, there is none.
07/02/2019, 13:14 - Phill: Hearing that Salah, Mane and Robbo are all a doubt for next game because of a nerve injury
07/02/2019, 13:16 - Sam;: The evidence of nerves is that the fans have realised they need to actively guard against producing a tense atmosphere. If there were no nerves they wouldn‚Äôt need to get the word around to manage the atmosphere
07/02/2019, 13:17 - David;: No they say 'momentum'. You've misread that as nerves because itfits your little narrative that sky have handed you
07/02/2019, 13:18 - David;: Form/injuries and nerves are not the same thing
07/02/2019, 13:18 - Paul;: üòÇ
07/02/2019, 13:20 - Sam;: Incorrect. Selective reading there Dave. The guys says they need to get the momentum going *again*.
07/02/2019, 13:21 - David;: Lol your point being? In no way relates to or mentions nerves.
07/02/2019, 13:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Can I no see a reference to nerves
07/02/2019, 13:30 - Sam;: Fuck sake. The nerves have ruined the momentum, hence the need to build it again.
07/02/2019, 13:32 - Sam;: And that‚Äôs the narrative in from the fans in the ground boyo!
07/02/2019, 13:33 - Hamish Sinclair: I see no evidence of causality
07/02/2019, 13:35 - David;: No, sorry, no mention of nerves. Unless you attribute all dropped points ever to nerves? Presumably you attributed city's dip in form over Christmas also to nerves then? Oh that's right, no you didn't. Next
07/02/2019, 13:36 - David;: Are Cardiff in the relegation zone because of a season long bout of nerves?
07/02/2019, 13:36 - Paul;: Sunderland nerves
07/02/2019, 13:36 - David;: Yeah big nerves there
07/02/2019, 13:39 - Sam;: Liverpool is nerves. Never win the prem. nose bleed territory. Just like 08/09 and 13/14
07/02/2019, 13:41 - David;: United since fergie left - 6 years of continual nerves
07/02/2019, 13:42 - David;: 'Man United - supplying you with nerves since 2013'
07/02/2019, 13:42 - Sam;: Deflecting. Tut tut
07/02/2019, 13:43 - David;: Sam it's okay, I understand how much the narrative means to you.
07/02/2019, 13:45 - David;: It's fine that you don't need evidence to support it. That's what faith is

10/02/2019, 17:31 - Paul;: How do you recover from this?
10/02/2019, 18:55 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
10/02/2019, 18:56 - Paul;: Is Phil Jones shit it turns out?
10/02/2019, 18:57 - David;: <Media omitted>
10/02/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: Yes
10/02/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: I often order one spaghetto Bolognese
10/02/2019, 19:00 - David;: I'd like a troll cafe to start bringing people 3 panini and charging them for it
10/02/2019, 19:00 - Paul;: My brothers colon
10/02/2019, 19:00 - David;: 'you ordered panini. Here's the bill'
10/02/2019, 19:01 - David;: I never heard you order a panino
10/02/2019, 19:10 - David;: <Media omitted>
10/02/2019, 19:12 - Phill: Chicago town deep pan microwave mini pizza king of palate burn
10/02/2019, 19:14 - Paul;: Haven‚Äôt seen them in ages
10/02/2019, 19:16 - Rob;: My local Sainsbury's has two aisles of Chicago Town deep pan microwave mini pizzas actually
10/02/2019, 19:16 - Rob;: Out of three
10/02/2019, 19:26 - Stefan;: Do they have all the combinations of toppings with every flavour pop tart base?
10/02/2019, 19:27 - David;: No, just strawberry and chocolate
10/02/2019, 19:27 - David;: Austerity britain
10/02/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: What‚Äôs your intake of pop tarts? Has it reached the heights of my fab addiction yet?
10/02/2019, 20:06 - David;: Nah just bought that one pack today. Had about 4.
10/02/2019, 20:07 - David;: How's the curry and roast fall out?
10/02/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Sex Education is great
10/02/2019, 21:40 - David;: Yeah yeah
10/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: I'm bringing it right now
10/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: *bineging
11/02/2019, 08:32 - Phill: Filmed in the wye valley. Symonds yeet.
11/02/2019, 08:32 - Phill: Meave is not fit. Come at me.
11/02/2019, 08:37 - David;: Rather be shagging her than not shagging her
11/02/2019, 08:38 - David;: Aimee is fitter
11/02/2019, 10:31 - Paul;: Sambo, if Man U got relegated would you still support them?
11/02/2019, 10:36 - Sam;: You need a job quick mate if this is the sort of stuff you‚Äôre thinking about
11/02/2019, 10:37 - Phill: He'd start supporting city I assume
11/02/2019, 10:39 - Paul;: Not sure you could handle the upset. As a Middlesbrough fan it‚Äôs something you become used to. Takes real mettle
11/02/2019, 17:27 - / James Ball: Earl Grey tea, better than regular tea. Yay or nay?
11/02/2019, 17:36 - David;: It fools you into thinking it is for a mug or two, but it just doesn't cut through in the same way.
11/02/2019, 17:42 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah. One mug is fine, anymore and it‚Äôs a no from me
11/02/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: at Framestore one department all swore by what they called turbo tea - one bag of Earl Grey and one normal bag, with milk
11/02/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: I got really into it for a while
11/02/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: Gives you the premium feel of the Earl, but the oomph of a proper brew
11/02/2019, 17:44 - David;: Oh yeah the blend is good - used to make that with loose leaf, one spoon of normal and one of EG
11/02/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: Yeah, I could drink mug after mug of that
11/02/2019, 17:45 - David;: I will refrain from calling it turbo tea though
11/02/2019, 17:45 - Rob;: 3D Tea was its other name
11/02/2019, 17:48 - David;: Tea already exists in 3 dimensional space
11/02/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: They were the 3D department
11/02/2019, 17:49 - Sam;: Sky sports reporting that Ramsey will get 400k a week. Surely not
11/02/2019, 17:50 - David;: That's making me think all other departments warped into a 2d 16 bit world when they entered the office, like me game and watch
11/02/2019, 17:50 - David;: *mr
11/02/2019, 17:50 - Rob;: Pretty much
11/02/2019, 17:51 - Rob;: Ornstein says it so it must be true
11/02/2019, 17:51 - David;: Where's he off?
11/02/2019, 17:51 - Rob;: Juve
11/02/2019, 17:51 - David;: Fucking juve hoovering up free midfielders
11/02/2019, 17:52 - David;: Pulled the same stunt with Can
11/02/2019, 17:52 - Sam;: I guess it‚Äôs the no fee effect. He‚Äôs pulled a blinder convincing them he‚Äôs worth that
11/02/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: Yeah, I mean he's very good and I would rather we kept him, but it's hard to justify that much
11/02/2019, 17:55 - David;: He won't be first team even
11/02/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: I went to an away day with work today
11/02/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: Held in a synagogue with function rooms for some reason
11/02/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: ...and lunch was pepperoni pizza
11/02/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: The organisers can round and confiscated it after the synagogue were like, 'yeah, you don't really eat pork in here'
11/02/2019, 18:19 - Rob;: Literally pulling it from people's hands
11/02/2019, 18:21 - Paul;: Who was organising that?
11/02/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: Some wanky business development company
11/02/2019, 18:22 - Paul;: Good mistake to make. Did they have peperami as well?
11/02/2019, 18:22 - Rob;: We all slaughtered a pig as a trust exercise later on
11/02/2019, 18:25 - Paul;: >the Grammys
11/02/2019, 18:25 - Paul;: Very embarrassing
11/02/2019, 18:52 - Phill: Saw someone walking around Cardiff today wearing my tracksuit non ironically
11/02/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 19:21 - David;: I've made the spiciest child ever. The pain on the way out will be remorseless

11/02/2019, 19:21 - David;: *chile
11/02/2019, 19:21 - David;: But child lol
11/02/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: The autocorrect that changed everything
11/02/2019, 19:21 - David;: Even better
11/02/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: >eating your spicy child
11/02/2019, 19:22 - Paul;: What chillis are you using?
11/02/2019, 19:22 - Rob;: God, I'm pissing myself
11/02/2019, 19:22 - David;: Birds eye
11/02/2019, 19:23 - David;: Devestation
11/02/2019, 19:23 - Paul;: Is it even nice to eat or just too much?
11/02/2019, 19:23 - David;: Far too much. Eyes watering
11/02/2019, 19:24 - Rob;: I made a great chilli sauce with haberneros, a more rounded flavoursome heat than bird's eye
11/02/2019, 19:24 - David;: I've put a lot of smoked paprika in as well plus crushed Chiles and cumin
11/02/2019, 19:25 - David;: Found a drop of Lea and perrins in a Chile actually works. Adds sweetness.
11/02/2019, 19:26 - Rob;: Yeah sweetness in chilli is a big thing
11/02/2019, 19:26 - David;: Yeah vital
11/02/2019, 19:26 - Rob;: A lot of recipes use cinnamon, which is good if you balance it right
11/02/2019, 19:26 - David;: Sirachi is good because has a lot of sugar in
11/02/2019, 19:26 - Rob;: And salt
11/02/2019, 19:27 - David;: Tinned sweet corn as well for the sugar
11/02/2019, 19:27 - Paul;: Next you‚Äôll start adding fruit
11/02/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: I use carrots in the base, which cook down and caramelise really nicely
11/02/2019, 19:28 - David;: Yep I use carrots, peppers and sweet corn
11/02/2019, 19:28 - David;: With mince and chopped tomato
11/02/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Sweet corn better charred seperately I'd say
11/02/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Usually just replace meat with more beans now
11/02/2019, 19:29 - David;: Nah it works. Black beans > kidney
11/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: Kidney are wank
11/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: The humble haricot is better
11/02/2019, 19:29 - David;: Black mate
11/02/2019, 19:30 - Rob;: Back good, but prefer in a  mix
11/02/2019, 19:30 - Rob;: *black are good
11/02/2019, 19:30 - David;: Don't like the paid colour of haricot
11/02/2019, 19:30 - David;: *palid
11/02/2019, 19:31 - Rob;: I sometimes throw in a tin of baked beans
11/02/2019, 19:33 - Paul;: I prefer a flan
11/02/2019, 20:51 - Phill: Made caremalised onion rice, garlic chicken and lemon yoghurt yesterday
11/02/2019, 20:51 - Phill: Peng pong
11/02/2019, 20:54 - Phill: My intestines are very effective at turning brown rice and chicken into perfect shit
11/02/2019, 20:54 - Phill: None of this tomato based slurry
11/02/2019, 21:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Dave, thoughts on coffee and chocolate in your chili?
11/02/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Surely this is too far
11/02/2019, 21:33 - David;: Never tried it. Not adverse to the chocolate but suspicious of the coffee
11/02/2019, 21:34 - David;: Lol. The loony left. Political correctness gone mad.
11/02/2019, 21:35 - Phill: Dan and Karen adding dairy milk and kenco to their frozen chilli
11/02/2019, 21:40 - Paul;: Redbull and horlicks
11/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: Red bull could work
11/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: There's that recipe where you boil chicken in Coke and it actually tastes great. Caremelises
11/02/2019, 21:42 - Phill: Yeah coke chicken goat. Also cooked a ham in coke this Christmas. Peng.
11/02/2019, 21:42 - Jack G;: Works well with gammon too
11/02/2019, 21:42 - Rob;: Yet brioche: 'too sweet'
11/02/2019, 21:43 - Paul;: Lol
11/02/2019, 21:43 - Paul;: Different entirely
11/02/2019, 21:43 - David;: Not the same
11/02/2019, 21:44 - Phill: gammon and coke = üëç
11/02/2019, 21:44 - Phill: Gammon and pineapple = üñï
11/02/2019, 21:45 - David;: ü•©ü•§
11/02/2019, 21:45 - Jack G;: üëå
11/02/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Cheese and pineapple = üñïüèª
11/02/2019, 21:45 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 21:46 - Paul;: Every village hall food served ever = cheese and pineapple
11/02/2019, 21:47 - David;: Rate it
11/02/2019, 21:48 - Rob;: Village halls are where all the bad things happen to food
11/02/2019, 21:49 - David;: Those shitty biscuits with the pink glaze
11/02/2019, 21:49 - David;: Never been served anywhere but a village Hall or fete
11/02/2019, 21:49 - Paul;: The cheapest off brand crisps in cheap praper bowls
11/02/2019, 21:49 - Paul;: Most acrid weakest squash premixed by some idiot mother
11/02/2019, 21:50 - Phill: Fuck off party rings are goat
11/02/2019, 21:50 - David;: Going round Zach's house circa year 8. Morrison's salt and vinegar 16 pack and constant operation flashpoint.
11/02/2019, 21:50 - Paul;: Party rings = 0/10. Never bought
11/02/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: Yeah leave our party rings alone Dave
11/02/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: The way the glaze dissolves on your tongue is peng
11/02/2019, 21:51 - David;: You'll have plenty of party rings after brexit rob
11/02/2019, 21:51 - Phill: Glaze tonguing followed by sweet dry biscuit
11/02/2019, 21:51 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 21:51 - Jack G;: So many better biscuit options than party rings
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Rob;: There was actually a national biscuit shortage for like a year after those floods in the north hit the United biscuit factory, who make all the own-brand biscuits too
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Paul;: A place where glacier mints for some reason often make an appearance. The worst
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Rob;: Tesco got letters every week but otherwise everyone was fine
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Phill: >glacier mints
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Rob;: Yeah those are terrible
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Jack G;: Iced gems too, fuck those
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Phill: Fuck you
11/02/2019, 21:53 - Rob;: Pre-grated cheese
11/02/2019, 21:53 - Paul;: Iced gems like eating chalk
11/02/2019, 21:53 - Phill: Bet if I bought a ten bag and a load of party rings and iced gems they would be fucking gone
11/02/2019, 21:54 - David;: Agree. Not even food. Wouldn't serve them to my pets
11/02/2019, 21:55 - David;: Not a fair scientific test
11/02/2019, 21:55 - Paul;: Phil can you create the meme village hall party starter pack
11/02/2019, 21:56 - Phill: Lol I will do it tomorrow at work
11/02/2019, 21:56 - Paul;: Any other critical shit foods we‚Äôre missing?
11/02/2019, 21:56 - David;: Ha, looking forward to this
11/02/2019, 21:57 - Jack G;: Jamie dodgers GOAT
11/02/2019, 21:58 - Paul;: Wagon wheels. Haven‚Äôt seen them for ages
11/02/2019, 21:58 - Paul;: The penguin bar
11/02/2019, 21:58 - Paul;: The club bar
11/02/2019, 21:58 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 21:58 - Paul;: Lol
11/02/2019, 21:58 - Phill: >not requesting shaggy
11/02/2019, 21:59 - David;: Very anaemic egg and cress sandwiches, low grade white bread (GI 100), crusts cut off
11/02/2019, 21:59 - Paul;: >the baha men
11/02/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: Very, very cold chicken drumsticks, really thickly covered in clingfilm
11/02/2019, 22:00 - Paul;: Tiny triangle sandwiches
11/02/2019, 22:00 - Paul;: Always margerine
11/02/2019, 22:00 - Paul;: And watery ham
11/02/2019, 22:00 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: A cheap Victoria sponge with an inch of icing and Moulan printed on the top
11/02/2019, 22:03 - Paul;: The little cup cakes with edible paper on them of Spider-Man or other generic thing
11/02/2019, 22:06 - David;: The wierd cheese twist things?
11/02/2019, 22:06 - David;: Feels like breathing cheese flavoured air
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Paul;: >turkey twizzlers
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Stefan;: Limp celery sticks with an unidentifiable dip
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Paul;: >potato smiley faces
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Stefan;: The healthy option
11/02/2019, 22:08 - Rob;: Ah yeah, that four-dip pack, where they're not labelled and you're not sure which is which
11/02/2019, 22:09 - Rob;: And they're white, off-white, salmon pink and white-pink
11/02/2019, 22:09 - Rob;: One's very horrible, the others taste the same
11/02/2019, 22:10 - Stefan;: You could definitely do a Brian Butterfield village fete food selection
11/02/2019, 22:10 - Paul;: That weird ham that had shapes in it
11/02/2019, 22:11 - Paul;: Looking and tasting worse than regular ham
11/02/2019, 22:12 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 22:32 - David;: Lol nah, do I no remember that
11/02/2019, 22:32 - David;: Looks fucking rank
11/02/2019, 22:36 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 22:54 - Rob;: At least it's honest about being reformed
11/02/2019, 22:55 - Rob;: Even the premium ranges of supermarket ham are reformed
11/02/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: Ham can fuck off outside of the form of gammon
11/02/2019, 22:58 - Paul;: ‚ÄúHam can fuck off‚Äù
11/02/2019, 22:58 - David;: Lol
11/02/2019, 22:59 - David;: What's wrong with a bit of reforming? Everything is reformed. All the matter in the universe has been reformed anyway.
11/02/2019, 23:00 - Paul;: >the reformation
11/02/2019, 23:00 - David;: I'm a reformed man.
11/02/2019, 23:00 - David;: The reformed church
11/02/2019, 23:01 - Rob;: Pork-effect slices
11/02/2019, 23:01 - Rob;: Ham-esque mousemats
11/02/2019, 23:01 - Paul;: Was in daylesford and they‚Äôre selling packs of ham at ¬£40. 6 slices
11/02/2019, 23:02 - Rob;: Imitation thin pig
11/02/2019, 23:02 - Rob;: That's probably great ham
11/02/2019, 23:03 - Paul;: You should be slamming the ham. You‚Äôre anti-Ham
11/02/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: Agree with good ham, but it's very hard to come by, and very expensive. If I'm having meat these days I'm not choosing ham
11/02/2019, 23:04 - Paul;: What about Iberian ham?
11/02/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: That's good
11/02/2019, 23:05 - Rob;: Literally has to be cut directly from a single piece of pig
11/02/2019, 23:06 - Rob;: All quality versions of ham are nice. Supermarket packet ham is mostly gross.
11/02/2019, 23:06 - David;: If you just want a nice ham and cheese toastie? You're not going to put gammon in that
11/02/2019, 23:06 - David;: That would be mental
11/02/2019, 23:06 - Rob;: Bacon in a cheese toastie
11/02/2019, 23:06 - Rob;: But shredded gammon would be great
11/02/2019, 23:07 - Rob;: Or just cheese
11/02/2019, 23:08 - David;: You've gone insane
11/02/2019, 23:09 - Rob;: Thin packet ham can't deal with heat. Doesn't crisp up. You can't trust it.
11/02/2019, 23:10 - Paul;: But then it wouldn‚Äôt be a cheese and ham toastie. Must include ham
11/02/2019, 23:10 - Rob;: Well yeah, well then if you put a gun to my head and make me make a cheese and ham toastie I'd just buy good quality ham and it would be fine
11/02/2019, 23:12 - Rob;: But eating formed ham is like eating chicken nuggets
11/02/2019, 23:19 - Damian Rumble: Does anyone fancy summarising the last 200 messages for me? Sorry I was playing purudo at the pub...
11/02/2019, 23:37 - Rob;: Just read it
11/02/2019, 23:37 - Rob;: You'll have...
11/02/2019, 23:37 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 06:13 - Phill: Ham is great. No arguments. Would rek a packet of Billy bear ham
12/02/2019, 08:02 - Phill: Old Gary lineker
12/02/2019, 08:02 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 08:02 - Rob;: But also old Peter Myson
12/02/2019, 09:27 - Hamish Sinclair: UTD surely favourites to go through against PSG? No Cavan, no neymar
12/02/2019, 09:32 - Sam;: I‚Äôm actually looking forward to it which a long way from when the draw was made
12/02/2019, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: I put a fiver on utd to win the champions league
12/02/2019, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: The whole set up has a very di Mateo Chelsea vibe
12/02/2019, 09:59 - Hamish Sinclair: I will support any team trying to knock psg out of the chamionsleague, so for this round only...
12/02/2019, 10:02 - David;: Lol sounds like a statement from your press office on brexit policy 'i am willing to support any team attempting to find a solution to the psg problem that can command a majority in the house and will work with United where this is in the national interest'
12/02/2019, 10:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, I feel like in the next sentence I need to down play my own leadership/champions league ambitions
12/02/2019, 10:08 - David;: Spurs Dortmund is also big
12/02/2019, 10:08 - David;: Sancho back at wembley
12/02/2019, 10:11 - Phill: We will go to the Parc De Princes and do what we have set out to do from the start, and that is to deliver the will of the fans. We will not be bullied into an untenable position where we return to Manchester without concessions on the "No Away Goals Compromise" We will not be discussing the nuances of our plan in public.
12/02/2019, 10:15 - Jack G;: Hard to stop them scoring without a backstop
12/02/2019, 10:15 - Sam;: Lol
12/02/2019, 10:16 - Sam;: We want a hard border in this case
12/02/2019, 10:35 - Rob;: Our plan is to limit Mbappe's freedom of movement
12/02/2019, 13:05 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 13:11 - / James Ball: Such memories.
12/02/2019, 13:12 - / James Ball: Who else went to that party at the Hook Norton sports and social that the organising parents just abandoned because everyone went outside
12/02/2019, 13:12 - / James Ball: Then we were just left in hook Norton for hours before our parents picked us up
12/02/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: Yeah
12/02/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: That was great
12/02/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: Didn't the sports club cancel it because there was alcohol?
12/02/2019, 13:47 - Rob;: Was it Carmel's party?
12/02/2019, 13:52 - Phill: Carly Jewett wasn't it?
12/02/2019, 13:53 - Rob;: That's it yeah
12/02/2019, 14:01 - / James Ball: I had a feeling it was Carmel's. Carly also had one there but was not abandoned, unless there was more than one Carly party
12/02/2019, 14:02 - / James Ball: Prime travelling businessman opportunity, loads of kids just running around unsupervised. I'm surprised nothing happened
12/02/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: Yeah, it was far worse to shut the party down
12/02/2019, 14:18 - Rob;: 'kids are being irresponsible here, we have no other option than to stop looking after them'
12/02/2019, 16:47 - Phill: FUCK. THIS. HIPSTER. SHIT.

12/02/2019, 16:49 - Paul;: >the 360 degree can
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs a brewery mate
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Phill: The fucking top though
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Phill: Such a massive hole
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Damian Rumble: Love it
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Phill: Why reinvent the fucking can
12/02/2019, 16:58 - Rob;: It is nicer to drink from
12/02/2019, 16:58 - Phill: No it's not
12/02/2019, 16:59 - Phill: It's like a cup, that's too small, but with a metal rim
12/02/2019, 17:01 - David;: I can live with it
12/02/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: Yeah it's fine
12/02/2019, 17:02 - Rob;: The one I've had by that brand has quite a lot of sediment and it's nice being able to see that so you don't drink it
12/02/2019, 17:02 - Phill: The beer itself is nice, drinking from hope solos anus is not
12/02/2019, 17:03 - Paul;: Don‚Äôt get that issue with a can of carling
12/02/2019, 17:03 - Rob;: Normal cans aren't that great to drink from. The bottle or glass are infinitely better than either
12/02/2019, 17:04 - Phill: <Media omitted>

12/02/2019, 17:12 - Phill: Perfectly fine.
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: Where's bottle?
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Phill: Between tin and cardboard
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm with Phil, avoiding can wherever possible.
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: Plastic pints spill your drink when you hold them
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Jack G;: Double up
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Phill: What are basic motor skills
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Rob;: Phil's put normal can third
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Jack G;: Yeah but still only above cardboard

12/02/2019, 17:13 - Phill: Glass pint and plastic pint way out in front.
12/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: Nah plastic pint feels cheap and nasty
12/02/2019, 17:14 - Phill: But cardboard on the other hand...
12/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: There's barely anything in it. Both shit
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: I hope your bringing your yard to glasto Rob
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: I always carry my yard
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Damian Rumble: Second this. Plastic is shit. People who like drinking from plastic are uneducated cretins
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: My yard brings all the guys to the yard
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: And they're like it's better than card
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: Damn right it's better than card
12/02/2019, 17:16 - Paul;: >not drinking out of cupped hands
12/02/2019, 17:16 - Phill: I could can you but I'd have to charge 15p recycling tax
12/02/2019, 17:18 - Rob;: This has been something special
12/02/2019, 18:35 - David;: What's the whole killing Eve shite then?
12/02/2019, 18:44 - David;: Sounds fucking bollocks
12/02/2019, 18:47 - Paul;: A lot going on with Sandra Oh‚Äôs face
12/02/2019, 18:51 - David;: I won't be watching
12/02/2019, 19:12 - Phill: Killing Eve is actually good.
12/02/2019, 19:19 - Stefan;: It's really good
12/02/2019, 19:22 - Sam;: She doesn‚Äôt kill eve
12/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: Yeah I've been meaning to watch. Heard a lot of good things
12/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: It's adapted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge from Fleabag, right?
12/02/2019, 19:31 - Stefan;: Yeah it is. You can see her influence in it
12/02/2019, 19:31 - David;: Won't be engaging
12/02/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: What are you going to watch instead?
12/02/2019, 19:32 - David;: Nothing
12/02/2019, 19:32 - David;: Just stare at the wall
12/02/2019, 19:34 - Phill: What's your beef man...
12/02/2019, 19:35 - David;: Annoying people raving about it
12/02/2019, 19:35 - Paul;: Hasn‚Äôt it been around for ages?
12/02/2019, 19:35 - Rob;: Yeah it was on months and months ago I think
12/02/2019, 19:36 - David;: Everyone keeps talking about it. Fucking everywhere
12/02/2019, 19:36 - David;: It's like breaking bad all over again
12/02/2019, 19:36 - Sam;: Lol, just fuming at the wall. Rather watch nothing
12/02/2019, 19:36 - David;: Got to disengage
12/02/2019, 19:36 - Paul;: Breaking bad was complete shit
12/02/2019, 19:37 - David;: Yes
12/02/2019, 19:37 - David;: People lost their minds
12/02/2019, 19:37 - Paul;: Oh look everything is purple ‚Äúwow so clever...best director ever...emotion‚Äù
12/02/2019, 19:37 - Phill: >being this butthurt about a show that you actually miss something good
12/02/2019, 19:38 - David;: I just hate buzz
12/02/2019, 19:38 - David;: Anything with buzz can fuck off
12/02/2019, 19:38 - Paul;: Lord of the rings?
12/02/2019, 19:38 - Rob;: Yeah, buzz and quality are not mutually exclusive
12/02/2019, 19:39 - Rob;: You're watching Sex Education. Huge buzz
12/02/2019, 19:39 - David;: But lord of the rings based on a classic novel from 60 years ago that I already knew was good. Not buzz
12/02/2019, 19:39 - David;: Tolkein refused to do interviews. The anti-buzz
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Phill: So edgy
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: Huge buzz
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: The most buzz
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: You couldn‚Äôt be buzzing more
12/02/2019, 19:40 - David;: No buzz. Recommended by fay, had never heard anyone else mention it
12/02/2019, 19:41 - Sam;: Less buzz in a beehive
12/02/2019, 19:41 - Rob;: So basically once the wrong sort of person recommend something to you you're out?
12/02/2019, 19:42 - David;: Yeah that's me gone
12/02/2019, 19:42 - David;: No road back from there
12/02/2019, 19:42 - Rob;: I feel like you need to more proactively seek out stuff or everything will get ruined for you
12/02/2019, 19:43 - David;: I've lost a lot of series this way. West wing.
12/02/2019, 19:44 - David;: Case in point
12/02/2019, 19:44 - Phill: What if you find a programme that is great and then a month later there is massive buzz. Do you suddenly hate it?
12/02/2019, 19:44 - David;: Nah then I'm in it's fine
12/02/2019, 19:45 - Rob;: So if you're in the bandwagon while you thing it's just a regular wagon then you're happy
12/02/2019, 19:45 - Paul;: Is west wing any good though. Never seen it. Maybe it‚Äôs just shit like breaking bad and you dodged a bullet
12/02/2019, 19:45 - David;: Yeah probably
12/02/2019, 19:45 - David;: There's a lot of raw shit going around
12/02/2019, 19:45 - Paul;: Lol
12/02/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: What‚Äôs on the in list at the moment?
12/02/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: And what is on the disengage?
12/02/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: How did you allow game of thrones to happen to you?
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Mainly documentaries. Your therouxs
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Game of thrones was me and sambo in air froust one
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Then I was in too deep
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Gin and ginger ales.
12/02/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: I‚Äôm staring killing Eve episode 1 right now
12/02/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: *starting
12/02/2019, 19:49 - David;: More buzz. Only deters me further
12/02/2019, 19:50 - Paul;: Could we engineer a scenario where you never get to watch anything again?
12/02/2019, 19:50 - Sam;: Yeah yeah yeah. Boozing to game of thrones.
12/02/2019, 19:51 - David;: That was when honkington Moyes was created as well
12/02/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: Sir
12/02/2019, 19:52 - David;: He got broken and just repeated 'i was working under the auspices of sir honkington moyes'
12/02/2019, 19:52 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 19:53 - Sam;: It was between the wars of course
12/02/2019, 19:53 - David;: Lol
12/02/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: How long was he broken for?
12/02/2019, 19:53 - David;: Ah like 3 hours of that I imagine
12/02/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: Lol
12/02/2019, 19:54 - Paul;: ‚ÄúAre you broken‚Äù
12/02/2019, 19:54 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 19:57 - Paul;: Killing Eve is just an annoying meme so far
12/02/2019, 19:57 - David;: What I expected
12/02/2019, 19:57 - David;: Predicted as much
12/02/2019, 19:58 - David;: Supporting United then. Feels very wrong and filthy
12/02/2019, 20:02 - Phill: Surprised you're watching the game what with all the buzz
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: Football fine
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: More buzz the better
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: Drama buzz is my issue
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: Comedy buzz is okay
12/02/2019, 20:06 - Rob;: I would say that buzz about Killing Eve is at its lowest point now since it came out
12/02/2019, 20:06 - Rob;: That's why it's so odd you've broken now
12/02/2019, 20:07 - David;: It's come to my attention
12/02/2019, 20:08 - Paul;: It‚Äôs like being on the generic batman page. So far behind the buzz but still feeling effects of the buzz
12/02/2019, 20:09 - David;: Yeah that's accurate. The buzz gets me late but then I'm furious
12/02/2019, 20:09 - Rob;: Being so underwater makes you so much more vulnerable
12/02/2019, 20:10 - Rob;: When you surface the buzz has spread to people you don't trust
12/02/2019, 20:10 - David;: I'm getting a shitty degraded isotope of the buzz
12/02/2019, 20:14 - David;: Yeah never jump onto a bandwagon, that's a classic rule. But if you happen to find yourself in a bandwagon then fine.
12/02/2019, 20:22 - Rob;: Can you ever come back from it do you think?
12/02/2019, 20:22 - Rob;: Would in say 10 years you able to watch the Wire?
12/02/2019, 20:28 - David;: What even is the wire?
12/02/2019, 20:29 - Rob;: Ah good
12/02/2019, 20:29 - Paul;: Who‚Äôs Raul moat
12/02/2019, 20:29 - Phill: Lol
12/02/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: It's a US show about the police and the drug trade in Baltimore. It's slow and incredibly well observed. Examines a different angle of the problem (politics, schools, newspapers etc) in each series.
12/02/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: It's how Idris Elba made his name
12/02/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: Really sucks you in
12/02/2019, 20:31 - Paul;: Sounds like a dangerous amount of buzz for Dave
12/02/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: I deliberately made that as flat as I could
12/02/2019, 20:35 - David;: You lost me at incredibly
12/02/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Stranger things complete shit
12/02/2019, 20:36 - David;: Ah yeah that was classic buzz. Steered well clear
12/02/2019, 20:36 - Rob;: Lol, as a qualifier for observation
12/02/2019, 20:39 - Phill: Stranger things great also you guys are fucking plebs
12/02/2019, 20:42 - Paul;: Stranger thing one of the worst. Shit. All hype
12/02/2019, 20:42 - David;: The buzz mate, the buzz
12/02/2019, 20:43 - David;: Mad men also shite
12/02/2019, 20:44 - Rob;: Good for a series or two
12/02/2019, 20:44 - Rob;: Almost all American shows go on too long
12/02/2019, 20:45 - David;: Got is too long even though I rate it
12/02/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: They got trolled by making it while he was still writing I think
12/02/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: Started it so slow then suddenly went mental when they got free of the books
12/02/2019, 20:47 - David;: And featured too many storylines so nothing happens. Should have cut some material/characters
12/02/2019, 20:49 - Paul;: Glad in agreement that stranger things is raw shit
12/02/2019, 20:51 - Rob;: Guess without knowing who's important in the end that was hard to do
12/02/2019, 20:52 - David;: Just wait then. Hold your beans
12/02/2019, 20:52 - Rob;: But the bunce mate
12/02/2019, 20:53 - Rob;: They do know the ultimate ending though
12/02/2019, 20:53 - Rob;: My mate who works on it knows
12/02/2019, 20:53 - David;: Hasn't told you?
12/02/2019, 20:54 - Rob;: I didn't want to know
12/02/2019, 20:54 - Rob;: This was way back on like series 4, would have wrecked a lot
12/02/2019, 20:55 - Rob;: I knew the fan theory about Jon Snow was right, but nothing more
12/02/2019, 20:58 - David;: Did anyone see the wild wild country documentary? Excellent
12/02/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: I won't be watching now you've buzzed it so much
12/02/2019, 21:00 - David;: But a historical documentary about a massive cult led by a corrupt Indian guru
12/02/2019, 21:01 - Paul;: Nah too much buzz. Next
12/02/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Ah I did actually watch one episode back in the summer thanks to all the buzz
12/02/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Was too hungover to deal
12/02/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Never went back
12/02/2019, 21:01 - David;: No I saw it pre-buzz. Was no buzz
12/02/2019, 21:02 - David;: Plus it actually happened. big difference

12/02/2019, 21:42 - David;: Was she anti-mail though?
12/02/2019, 21:42 - David;: Just collaborating
12/02/2019, 21:42 - Rob;: She wasn't anti it enough
12/02/2019, 21:42 - Rob;: One of the collaborators who hadn't had to have her family held hostage or anything

13/02/2019, 16:58 - Damian Rumble: As if Theresa May was not in enough of a jam over Brexit, she has now sparked a debate about how to handle actual jam - the kind that comes in jars.
13/02/2019, 16:58 - Damian Rumble: It comes after she reportedly told cabinet ministers she scrapes the mould off the fruit preserve rather than throw it away.
13/02/2019, 16:58 - Damian Rumble: The SNP's Pete Wishart picked up on PM's comment on Twitter, saying it was "a bit like she runs the Tory Party".

19/02/2019, 19:13 - David;: How's Serge gnabry turned up in the Bayern first team?
19/02/2019, 19:30 - Rob;: It was weird when he left, they really wanted him, then he ended up going to Werder Bremen, then eventually Bayern
19/02/2019, 19:31 - David;: Thought he was just a little fella
19/02/2019, 19:32 - Rob;: Highly sought after on the Bundesliga, hated by Tony Pulis

20/02/2019, 11:36 - David;: But they haven't had to actually get elected as the independent group
20/02/2019, 11:36 - David;: Not really equivalent

20/02/2019, 11:41 - David;: Embarrassing. Literally meaningless
20/02/2019, 11:44 - Damian Rumble: Ironic as Corbyn was supposed to be the 'new politics'
20/02/2019, 11:44 - Rob;: It's strange that the pro remain middle ground has yielding such slim pickings for the Lib Dems even now
20/02/2019, 11:45 - Damian Rumble: Just not the write kind of 'new politics'
20/02/2019, 11:45 - Rob;: One broken promise 9 years ago still ruining them
20/02/2019, 11:46 - Damian Rumble: It's ridiculous. No other party has been so harshly judged by one decision.
20/02/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: The lib Dems suffer more from a previous association with the Tories than the Tories do from being the actual Tories

You probably do not heard about me and you are probably wondering for what reason you're receiving this message, is it right?
I'm ahacker who burstyour email boxand all devicestwo months ago.
It will be a time wasting to attempt to communicate with me or seek for me, it is definitely not possible, since I directed you an email using YOUR hacked account.
I have build in malware soft on the adult vids (porno) website and suppose that you have watched this website to have a good time (you realize what I want to say).
While you have been keeping an eye on vids, your browser began functioning as a RDP (Remote Control) that have a keylogger that granted me access to your display and webcam.
Afterward, my softwarestoleall info.
You have wrote passwords on the web services you visited, I intercepted them.
Of course, it's possible to change each of them, or possibly already changed them.
But it really does not matter, my malware renews it regularly.
What I have done?
I made a reserve copy of your system. Of all the files and each contact.
I created a dual-screen video. The 1 section shows the video you had been observing (you've got a very good preferences, haha...), and the 2nd part reveals the tape from your camera.
What do you have to do?
Well, I think, 1000 USD will be a good price for our very little riddle. You'll do the deposit by bitcoins (if you don't know this, search ‚Äúhow to buy bitcoin‚Äù in any search engine).
My bitcoin wallet address:
1CUmFahadM9fmENHcdepbwSENEdmqh7VeF
(It is cAsE sensitive, so just copy and paste it).
Important:
You will have only 48 hours in order to make the payment. (I built in an unique pixel to this email, and right now I understand that you've read this email).
To tracethe reading of a letterand the actionsin it, I installeda Facebook pixel. Thanks to them. (That whichcan be usedfor the authorities can helpus.)

In the event I do not get bitcoins, I shall immediately transfer your videofile to each of your contacts, along with family members, co-workers, and so forth?
25/02/2019, 13:43 - / James Ball: Thought you might enjoy reading this spam email sent to me. I like the poor english mixed with delicate humour

26/02/2019, 10:53 - David;: Burden of proof is on you
26/02/2019, 10:53 - Rob;: Horse's teeth are the best way to tell a horse's age, but of someone's given it to you for free you shouldn't be questioning how good a gift it is, just accept it
26/02/2019, 10:54 - David;: Just accept your shitty rotten toothed horse and be grateful you cunt
26/02/2019, 11:01 - Damian Rumble: Had a feeling Rooble would know that one

08/03/2019, 12:29 - Phill: Or some point in aug. Just means less leave required if BH.
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: Pate man's lunch
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: 20 eggs
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: Microwave scrambled
08/03/2019, 13:17 - Jack G;: All 20?
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: A good amount of them
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: Just bowls of horrible smelling scrambled egg
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: No sauce
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: No salt
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: No pepper
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: Just egg.
08/03/2019, 13:23 - David;: Is he aware this isn't normal?
08/03/2019, 13:23 - David;: Or is it the elephant in the room
08/03/2019, 13:28 - Phill: He gets abuse for it.
08/03/2019, 13:30 - David;: And doesn't give a fuck? Welcomes their hatred
08/03/2019, 13:31 - Phill: Its that kind of building site banter so it's more playful
08/03/2019, 13:31 - Phill: That the kind of environment I now work in
08/03/2019, 13:32 - Phill: Had someone walking round recently saying everything in an Indian accent. Not Indian.
08/03/2019, 13:32 - David;: So he takes it in good humour
08/03/2019, 13:32 - David;: Ha amazing
08/03/2019, 13:33 - Phill: Yeah yeah. You wouldn't last long here if you couldn't take a bit of banter.
08/03/2019, 13:43 - Paul;: It‚Äôs just banter
08/03/2019, 13:47 - Sam;: Pour lighter fluid on keyboard. Light it. It‚Äôs just banter
08/03/2019, 13:47 - Sam;: You‚Äôve still got to finish that report though
08/03/2019, 13:47 - Paul;: Slash the tires. Just banter
08/03/2019, 13:48 - Paul;: Bet you thought you‚Äôd be going to your child‚Äôs school play. Guess again. Just banter
08/03/2019, 13:49 - Sam;: We‚Äôve handcuffed a fire extinguisher to each limb. Just banter
08/03/2019, 13:49 - Paul;: We‚Äôve been putting mercury in your food for months. Just banter
08/03/2019, 14:01 - Phill: So he just got back from the shop with this bag
08/03/2019, 14:01 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 14:01 - Phill: Beef. Monster. Hummus
08/03/2019, 14:03 - Phill: Should probably stop taking photos of his gump
08/03/2019, 14:03 - David;: Dipping sausages in hummus? Quite close
08/03/2019, 14:08 - Paul;: Zero sugar monster though
08/03/2019, 14:09 - David;: Health conscious
08/03/2019, 14:16 - Phill: Zero sugar just means more unknown shit though
08/03/2019, 14:17 - Phill: Give me the sugar mate. At least I know where I stand with it.
08/03/2019, 14:23 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt advertise chocolate within 100m of a school - did you know that?
08/03/2019, 14:23 - Paul;: The uk changed
08/03/2019, 14:24 - Jack G;: >advertising chocolate
08/03/2019, 14:24 - David;: Fatties already know about the chocolate
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Jack G;: Everyone‚Äôs heard of chocolate and fucking loves it already
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Paul;: Or sugary drinks
08/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: Yeah, it's not lack of information holding back their gorging
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Paul;: Or sweets
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Paul;: Or sausage rolls
08/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: It's their shrivelled will power and gluttony
08/03/2019, 14:26 - Paul;: All those walls ice cream adverts. No more
08/03/2019, 14:26 - Paul;: Had all but forgotten
08/03/2019, 14:27 - David;: Not allowed to advertise weed anywhere. Still seems to be consumed
08/03/2019, 14:27 - David;: Very few Ket adverts around
08/03/2019, 14:36 - Paul;: Definitely a correlation between sales and advertising of chocolate I would have thought
08/03/2019, 14:37 - Sam;: It‚Äôs advertising to children specifically that they‚Äôre trying to address
08/03/2019, 14:53 - Jack G;: Advertising to children doesn‚Äôt seem like a great strategy anyway. Not much disposable income
08/03/2019, 14:54 - Sam;: Ever heard of parents?
08/03/2019, 14:54 - Rob;: Lol
08/03/2019, 14:55 - Jack G;: Then surely target the parents as if it‚Äôs something good for the kids. Don‚Äôt go direct to the kids?
08/03/2019, 14:55 - Rob;: Teh whole toy industry dismissed
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: I think the reasoning is that when a kid really wants something parents tend to buy it for them
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Paul;: Jack always got adult toys
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: Whereas parents would be more sober in their spending if it was 100% up to them what they bought
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Sam;: Pester power, in advertising terminology
08/03/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: Sorry Jack, I know you wanted an X-wing model, but I've got you a fine leather wallet
08/03/2019, 14:57 - Jack G;: Lol
08/03/2019, 14:57 - Paul;: Jack what was your childhood lol
08/03/2019, 14:59 - Rob;: I know Furbies are all the rage, but here's a set of slate serving boards that I think you'll come to appreciate
08/03/2019, 14:59 - Jack G;: Never got toys, just home accessories and clothes
08/03/2019, 15:00 - Paul;: Of course. Home accessories
08/03/2019, 15:00 - Jack G;: I only had chocolate in mind when making this claim. Realised my mistake as soon as Rob brought up toys
08/03/2019, 15:01 - Phill: Oh you wanted the Game Boy Color? We thought you wanted a coffee table book about Parisian architecture.
08/03/2019, 15:02 - Paul;: Jack, which home accessories were most memorable from your childhood?
08/03/2019, 15:03 - Jack G;: Got a great bedside lamp once, Christmas 1996 was lit
08/03/2019, 15:03 - David;: The word has got out about chocolate. Not a secret
08/03/2019, 15:03 - Rob;: üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëè
08/03/2019, 15:03 - Rob;: Played your way out of defense well there
08/03/2019, 15:04 - David;: Also parents famously don't go to school.
08/03/2019, 15:04 - Sam;: Are you broken?
08/03/2019, 15:04 - David;: Targeting the one place pester power will be least effective
08/03/2019, 15:05 - David;: Longest time lag between exposure to advert and point of pester
08/03/2019, 15:05 - Sam;: Because kids have got so much to think about..
08/03/2019, 15:05 - Rob;: But chocolate isn't beyond children's spending power, they get pocket money, can buy a 50p bar
08/03/2019, 15:06 - Sam;: Wake up in a cold sweat, ‚Äú I forgot to fucking pester! SSHHHHIIIIITT‚Äù
08/03/2019, 15:06 - David;: So it's only because they see the chomp advert that they guzzle anchomp down? Not through seeing the actual chomp in the canteen? Are you broken?
08/03/2019, 15:07 - David;: See chomp, buy chomp. An advert never has to get involved in the school. How many chomp bill boards were just scattered around in chippy school?
08/03/2019, 15:08 - Sam;: Dr David Tangent
08/03/2019, 15:08 - Sam;: Chomp billboards?
08/03/2019, 15:08 - Paul;: Not in schools anymore though are they
08/03/2019, 15:09 - Paul;: How would they know
08/03/2019, 15:09 - David;: They never were. Never saw a chocolate advert in our school. Saw lots of actual chocolate and then bought it
08/03/2019, 15:09 - Paul;: But you don‚Äôt get any choc in schools anymore
08/03/2019, 15:09 - Rob;: Near schools not in them
08/03/2019, 15:10 - Rob;: Chippy's a poor example, too rural
08/03/2019, 15:10 - Sam;: See chomp, buy chomp, drink Coca Cola
08/03/2019, 15:10 - Rob;: inner city schools where all the nearby bus stops and tune station carry junk food adverts will have been the target
08/03/2019, 15:10 - David;: All the chomp bill boards down glyme lane?
08/03/2019, 15:11 - Jack G;: All you noobs eating chomps. Curly Wurly way better
08/03/2019, 15:11 - Paul;: >chomp billboard
08/03/2019, 15:11 - Paul;: That‚Äôs destroyed me
08/03/2019, 15:12 - Sam;: Build the wall! (In front of the chomp billboard)
08/03/2019, 15:13 - David;: So a fatty is walking to school. Really wants some chocolate. 'oh no I've not seen a chomp advert for 300m. I better just order some lettuce'.
08/03/2019, 15:13 - David;: A bullshit reform
08/03/2019, 15:14 - David;: Nothing at all will be impacted by this.
08/03/2019, 15:14 - Paul;: Just like how sales of cigarettes went up after they stopped advertising them...
08/03/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: Companies wouldn't be buying the adverts if they weren't effective
08/03/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: Probably short term. Far fewer people smoke now
08/03/2019, 15:15 - Paul;: No I mean they obviously went down
08/03/2019, 15:15 - David;: Red Herring. We're already going down due to wider societal changes. Cant establish causality vs correlation
08/03/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: Irony hard to spot in this thread
08/03/2019, 15:15 - David;: *were
08/03/2019, 15:16 - Paul;: The ellipsis rob the ellipsis. Classic irony
08/03/2019, 15:17 - David;: Need to invent a new punctuation mark. The irony mark
08/03/2019, 15:17 - Rob;: You're basically denying the effectiveness of all advertising Dave
08/03/2019, 15:18 - Paul;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø - the irony punctuation mark
08/03/2019, 15:18 - David;: Absolutely not. Specifically placed it in the context of junk food and the 300m perimeter making any difference
08/03/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø Dave you cunt ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
08/03/2019, 15:19 - David;: https://goo.gl/images/TfgbBi
08/03/2019, 15:19 - David;: Are you able to resist buying one now Rob?
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Paul;: But if it was toys it would work? Only junk food that happens to be exclusively ineffective
08/03/2019, 15:20 - David;: Or you've seen that so there's nothing to be done now
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Rob;: I'm eating one now
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: There‚Äôs a big difference between advertising and marketing though
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: Advertising not so effective
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Rob;: This thread is a Chomp dream. Discussing their brand constantly
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Stefan;: Already been done - it's a reversed question mark
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø - this is better
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: More practical
08/03/2019, 15:21 - David;: A real piece of shit
08/03/2019, 15:22 - Paul;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
08/03/2019, 15:22 - Stefan;: I thought that means "don't give a shit"
08/03/2019, 15:25 - Rob;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
08/03/2019, 15:25 - Paul;: Idiotic to think that ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
08/03/2019, 15:28 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 15:29 - Rob;: Yeah I would be thinking about getting a Chomp if that was suspended above the Albion Tavern
08/03/2019, 15:29 - Rob;: More than another bar, for sure. Look how big it is.
08/03/2019, 15:30 - David;: But you would have seen the actual bar and it's size in the canteen? But the billboard was crucial.
08/03/2019, 15:30 - Rob;: The hippo can't _believe_ the size of that Chomp, David
08/03/2019, 15:30 - Sam;: THEY CANT SELL THEM IN SCHOOLS ANYMORE DAVE
08/03/2019, 15:31 - Jack G;: The chain chomp got me
08/03/2019, 15:40 - David;: I would say toys are less connected to a bodily need or chemical addiction hence marketing somewhat more central to engineering demand vs underlying product design than in junk food markets, yes.
08/03/2019, 15:42 - Phill: DAT new toy buzz doe
08/03/2019, 15:42 - David;: Yeah exactly
08/03/2019, 15:43 - / James Ball: Dat new lamp buzz for Jack
08/03/2019, 15:44 - / James Ball: Ice cream vans also not allowed to set up near schools at home time either
08/03/2019, 15:44 - David;: Ridiculous. Not Mr whippy too?
08/03/2019, 15:45 - Sam;: Dr David Jargon. Marketing Expert
08/03/2019, 15:45 - David;: WHEN WILL IT END?
08/03/2019, 15:46 - Paul;: Really need some damo input into this
08/03/2019, 15:46 - Paul;: He casts aside the thread as all about football
08/03/2019, 15:49 - David;: I mean, doctorate in a fairly closely related subject.
08/03/2019, 15:50 - David;: Not a total layman.
08/03/2019, 15:51 - Sam;: Chomp vs stretch Armstrong marketing?
08/03/2019, 15:51 - David;: There's a lot of economic psychology literature about exactly that sort of thing for different products/sectors.
08/03/2019, 15:54 - Sam;: Yeah I get it, advertising a bigger chomp is more effective than advertising a bigger stretch Armstrong.
08/03/2019, 15:54 - Sam;: NOW WITH A REALISTIC 10 INCHER
08/03/2019, 15:54 - Sam;: STRETCH DICK STRONG
08/03/2019, 15:55 - Sam;: DR DICK STRONG
08/03/2019, 15:55 - David;: I think that was the title of the paper presented to the royal society
08/03/2019, 15:59 - Phill: How do you explain TV ads?
08/03/2019, 15:59 - Phill: BIGGER SCREEN MORE PIXELS MORE DEEP BLACK HIGHER K
08/03/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: I like that TV ads for TVs attempt to show the leap in quality to you on your existing screen
08/03/2019, 16:08 - Rob;: It will look exactly the same as what you were already seeing
08/03/2019, 16:30 - Jack G;: Like the algorithms on shopping websites that recommend the exact same thing that you just bought. No thanks
08/03/2019, 16:30 - Paul;: Damian can you have a word
08/03/2019, 17:45 - Sam;: VAR debate anyone?
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Sam;: I‚ù§VAR
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Sam;: (And petrol)
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Jack G;: Slow motion makes everything look bad
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Jack G;: NEXT
08/03/2019, 17:47 - Sam;: You‚Äôve got to look at the whole clip.
08/03/2019, 17:47 - Sam;: Kimpembe knows what he‚Äôs doing when he jumps and turns his body
08/03/2019, 17:48 - Sam;: Arm string outwards whilst turning
08/03/2019, 17:48 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs a good concept. Need the refs to get used to it though
08/03/2019, 17:49 - Jack G;: You can imagine Mike Dean dragging out a VAR decision just for the drama
08/03/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: I think they are now. Wednesday highlighted that some of the rules are overly complicated. UEFA said the pen decision is correct according to the rules.
08/03/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: Mike dean was born to VAR
08/03/2019, 17:52 - Jack G;: I agree it was a pen
08/03/2019, 17:52 - Jack G;: Ironic that VAR was brought in to reduce controversy though
08/03/2019, 17:52 - Jack G;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
08/03/2019, 17:54 - Sam;: Lol. There was always going to be fine tuning needed. I would say VAR is proving that it‚Äôs now the technology that needs fine tuning, it‚Äôs the rules and they ways in which they can be interpreted
08/03/2019, 17:55 - Paul;: ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
08/03/2019, 17:55 - Sam;: Imho, expro‚Äôs opinions aren‚Äôt  valid as it‚Äôs like asking an accountant who retired 10 years ago to do your books. Doesn‚Äôt know the latest rules
08/03/2019, 17:57 - Jack G;: Yeah it‚Äôs the subjective stuff that VAR isn‚Äôt great at. Handball, tackles where intent for the ball isn‚Äôt clear. Also how far back in play do you take the video clips
08/03/2019, 17:58 - Jack G;: Sorry your goal is ruled out because Aguero got fouled at 36 minutes which led to a free kick which led to the corner that the counter attack was launched from which ended in a penalty
08/03/2019, 17:58 - Sam;: Well I just meant about 5 frames back rather than a still on the moment it touches the arm
08/03/2019, 17:59 - Sam;: Just to fuck everyone up even further, apparently, if United had taken a quick corner then the VAR review becomes null and void.
08/03/2019, 18:00 - Sam;: Quick free kick/corners are penalised. Have to choose that or VAR review
08/03/2019, 18:00 - Jack G;: Maybe it should be like tennis where both teams get two VAR reviews per half
08/03/2019, 18:01 - Phill: It's gone too VAR in my opinion.
08/03/2019, 18:01 - Sam;: Too slow though. In tennis a single player decides for themselves. Are the coaching staff going deliberate before using a VAR call
08/03/2019, 18:02 - Jack G;: Football clubs would start employing VAR analysts
08/03/2019, 18:04 - Jack G;: In rugby it‚Äôs all on the refs and TMO. So the TMO is constantly reviewing the match footage and flags stuff up for the ref to review. Works really well
08/03/2019, 18:05 - Sam;: That‚Äôs the way VAR is though. Rugby rules are clearer and less subjective
08/03/2019, 18:13 - Jack G;: Also you don‚Äôt get the players kicking off at the ref. Need to stamp that out
08/03/2019, 18:16 - David;: Think they should introduce challenges like in tennis. Teams start with 3 challenges and captain can send a decision to review. Lose it if onfield decision was right. Keeps a lid on it being used for trivial shit and takes away subjectivity of ref in when to call for it.
08/03/2019, 18:18 - David;: Ah just read up and Jack just said that
08/03/2019, 18:18 - David;: Void. I lose a challenge
08/03/2019, 18:19 - Sam;: In football would you give challenge rights to the captain or manager? How do you prevent conferring
08/03/2019, 18:19 - David;: Captain
08/03/2019, 18:19 - David;: And has to do it within e.g. 10 seconds of incident
08/03/2019, 18:20 - Sam;: Makes sense, he‚Äôs on the pitch, so closer
08/03/2019, 18:20 - David;: So reduced scope for conferral
08/03/2019, 18:20 - Sam;: Can take quick opinion from teammates
08/03/2019, 18:20 - David;: Also like the idea of giving captain role more meaning again
08/03/2019, 18:20 - Sam;: Yeah defo
08/03/2019, 18:22 - Sam;: Although I‚Äôm conflicted between the idea of conveying value to a challenge by limiting number and the purist intent of reducing bad decision. You could be out of challenges, then a big incident comes up
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Rob;: I think every player needs a drone cam permanently 1 ft above their heads
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Rob;: 22 drones, plus ref and lino drones
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Sam;: Perfect
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Sam;: Lino drone jr
08/03/2019, 18:24 - Sam;: Lino di capridrone
08/03/2019, 18:24 - Rob;: Short players drones would be at eye height for larger players
08/03/2019, 18:24 - David;: Broken
08/03/2019, 18:25 - Sam;: Derp Blunderdrone
08/03/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: Welcome to the Blunderdome
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Sam;: Big fan of shipyard pale ale these days. Nice half way house between larger and ale
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Yeah it's one of the nicer ones you find on tap a lot
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: I really dislike Five Points
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: See that too much
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Beavertown Neckoil is great
08/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Mosaic is good too
08/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: Honking on this. Great little imported lager my local supermarket does
08/03/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Candy cane/barbershop vibe
08/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: They've just done lager. Worked it out. Don't need to drink any other now
08/03/2019, 18:30 - Sam;: Must be a Scotland special. Not seen it in the UK
08/03/2019, 18:30 - Sam;: you‚Äôll have to smuggle some back
08/03/2019, 18:30 - Sam;: If you can get over Hadrian‚Äôs wall with it
08/03/2019, 18:30 - David;: Yeah yeah, they stick different stuff here. Newcastle brown everywhere
08/03/2019, 18:30 - David;: *stock
08/03/2019, 18:31 - David;: I believe you could describe this as a crisp pint. Very crisp.
08/03/2019, 18:32 - Rob;: The crispiest liquid going
08/03/2019, 18:32 - Sam;: I üíì crisp. How‚Äôs the flavour?
08/03/2019, 18:33 - David;: Fruity, slightly citrus vibe
08/03/2019, 18:33 - Sam;: Ooof. I‚Äôm gurning over that
08/03/2019, 18:33 - David;: But without the cloying fruitiness when they overdo it chasing the hipsters
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Like Brewdog Elvis Juice
08/03/2019, 18:34 - David;: Where I may as well just be drinking grapefruit juice
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Did i no want to drink 6.5% lilt
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Lel. Alcoholic umbongo please
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Umbongo and snake bite
08/03/2019, 18:36 - Rob;: I'm a big fan of the craft beer trend in the way that it's led to tiny cornershops stocking loads of different beers on permanent 3 for ¬£X deals. It's fun just rinsing a few on a Friday night and seeing what's good
08/03/2019, 18:36 - Sam;: Yeah, not just krony or Stella on offer
08/03/2019, 18:37 - Sam;: (Though I üíó Stella obvs)
08/03/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Not a fan of anything much over 5% really in the craft world
08/03/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Let me taste the beer not the alcohol
08/03/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: Yeah piss lager has its place. A deathly cold Stella on a sweltering day  slakes thirst like no other
08/03/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: You don't want a porter at beach
08/03/2019, 18:38 - Hamish Sinclair: This is fine until you realise 90% are shit. Once you find a nice one it's difficult to not just want to continue gumping that
08/03/2019, 18:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Another gamma ray please
08/03/2019, 18:39 - Rob;: I've had some better odds than that, but some are shit
08/03/2019, 18:40 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 18:50 - David;: Not on board with this small IPA cans thing - brewdog etc.
08/03/2019, 18:51 - David;: American beer culture is so shit - really strong 7% ipas everywhere.
08/03/2019, 18:52 - Rob;: Yeah strong is shit
08/03/2019, 18:52 - David;: Agreed, it improves so much having been chilled for like 3 days.
08/03/2019, 18:53 - David;: When you find one on Sunday that's been sitting there since the Friday sesh
08/03/2019, 18:53 - David;: Chilled to within an inch of it's life
08/03/2019, 18:53 - Sam;: Are we all agreed that Sergio Ramos‚Äô week has been great for everyone
08/03/2019, 18:53 - David;: Yeah yeah very entertaining
08/03/2019, 18:54 - David;: The thing about him making a doccy about himself as they were crashing out
08/03/2019, 18:54 - David;: Partly due to his own fuck up with the card
08/03/2019, 18:54 - Sam;: So delicious. Not sure I can take another bite
08/03/2019, 18:54 - Sam;: So full of his hubris
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: Gloucester gold
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: 3.9%
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: A real gumping ale
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: Explaining to Becca the concept of a guzzling beer
08/03/2019, 19:04 - Phill: She drinks so slowly. Smashed 3 pints in the time it's taken her to drink   three quarters of a pint.
08/03/2019, 19:04 - Phill: She doesn't understand that some beer is brewed to.guzzle.
08/03/2019, 19:05 - David;: She's unwilling to guzzle?
08/03/2019, 19:05 - David;: Would she drink a strong beer at the same rate as a weak one or is there some variation?
08/03/2019, 19:06 - Phill: Same rate.
08/03/2019, 19:06 - Phill: Always.
08/03/2019, 19:08 - Rob;: I had two Doombars in 45 mins at lunch. It just slips down you
08/03/2019, 19:08 - Phill: Drinks wine at the same rate
08/03/2019, 19:09 - Rob;: Doesn't actually sound fast at all, but what I mean is I was barely aware i'd drunk them
08/03/2019, 19:09 - David;: Fan of doombar
08/03/2019, 19:44 - Paul;: Pomegranates in salads. Can I get a consensus
08/03/2019, 19:44 - David;: No
08/03/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Grit/10.
08/03/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Just in Tesco's semi pissed with Becca.
08/03/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Talking about pudding.
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: She sees an ad for mini eggs.
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: "let's get mini eggs"
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: I say
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: " do you actually want mini eggs or is it because of the ad?"
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: She decides it's because of the ad.
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: Explain?
08/03/2019, 19:52 - Paul;: She‚Äôs not a child though. Adults easily swayed
08/03/2019, 19:52 - Phill: Ah.
08/03/2019, 19:55 - David;: So was she just not guzzling because driving back?
08/03/2019, 19:55 - Phill: Ah no with her mum who is driving
08/03/2019, 19:57 - David;: Lol good to discuss how fast you guzzle booze in front of the in-laws
08/03/2019, 19:58 - Phill: No biggie. Me Becca and her mum stayed up until 6am drinking spirits and smoking this Christmas.
08/03/2019, 19:58 - David;: Bants
08/03/2019, 19:58 - Phill: Chatting shit.
08/03/2019, 19:58 - David;: That's ideal
08/03/2019, 20:00 - Phill: Such a rank hangover the next day though. Vomming and shitting.
08/03/2019, 20:01 - David;: We got of lightly after sambos considering how much we guzzled
08/03/2019, 20:01 - David;: Good night
08/03/2019, 20:02 - Phill: Ruined boxing day.
08/03/2019, 20:08 - David;: Was watching a YouTube video of a girlfriend reviewing her boyfriend playing different games. So the meta review of watching someone else playing and how pleasant/annoying it is as a back seat gamer
08/03/2019, 20:08 - Phill: Yeah. Guzzling the pastis. Hope Tony and Judith didn't mind.
08/03/2019, 20:09 - Phill: Backseating the backseater.
08/03/2019, 20:09 - David;: *channel
08/03/2019, 20:09 - Phill: "you shouldn't review it like this. This is how to review this"
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Phill: New gervais on Netflix.
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Phill: "peado"
08/03/2019, 20:26 - David;: It's called peado?
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: "peado? I'm not a peado. If I was, you'd be safe you tubby little ginger cunt"
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Nah it's called after life.
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Reviewing it now.
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: It's in the balance. But some good lines so far.
08/03/2019, 20:27 - David;: Ah good let me know how it pans out
08/03/2019, 20:32 - Phill: Want to hate it but it's actually alright.
08/03/2019, 20:32 - David;: Gervais not being a self absorbed cunt in it?
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Not so much.
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: It feels like he's playing an actual character this time
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Rather than just being Gervais
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: I mean it is Gervais.
08/03/2019, 20:35 - Phill: Got a few Extras and Office actors in
08/03/2019, 20:40 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 21:12 - Phill: 3 episodes in
08/03/2019, 21:12 - Phill: Worth a watch tbh
08/03/2019, 22:17 - David;: Ah cunk is involved
08/03/2019, 22:17 - David;: Pretty good so far
08/03/2019, 22:41 - David;: Merchant has that new wrestling film out as well
08/03/2019, 23:43 - David;: He's still using jokes that came up in the pilkington shows
09/03/2019, 11:16 - David;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR8zpEwR7js
09/03/2019, 11:16 - David;: Revisited. Such utter shit.
09/03/2019, 11:17 - David;: Presenter must have been on heavy drugs
09/03/2019, 11:17 - Phill: It's a personification of my brain on Mandy, balloons, ket and weed.
09/03/2019, 11:18 - Rob;: Did Pat Sharp come to you unis as well? Gave an incredibly uncomfortable low-budget fun house spoof in the middle of a night out
09/03/2019, 11:20 - David;: The obligatory forced scream after anything happens
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Phill: I regret the slow phasing out of gunge in TV
09/03/2019, 11:22 - David;: Yeah same
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: Yeah
09/03/2019, 11:22 - David;: There must have been one company that made all the gunge and went bust or something
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Phill: Sharp definitely fucking Melanie and Martina backstage
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: A public gunging would be a great punishment
09/03/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: Get Shamima Begun a good gunging and get on with it
09/03/2019, 11:23 - David;: It was just a classic show finale.
09/03/2019, 11:23 - David;: Mess, chaos and humiliation
09/03/2019, 11:24 - Phill: Always big build up to the gunging.
09/03/2019, 11:24 - Phill: CRANK IT UUUUPPPP
09/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: Yes and then often quite slow and underwhelming delivery mechanism
09/03/2019, 11:24 - Rob;: The general election should have the main leaders in gunge tanks as they collect the votes. Only the new prime minister stays dry
09/03/2019, 11:28 - David;: Lol, 10.15. 'dumbbell', 'dumb blonde'.
09/03/2019, 11:28 - David;: Of its time
09/03/2019, 12:29 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
09/03/2019, 12:40 - David;: M23 derby then
09/03/2019, 12:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Seagulls
09/03/2019, 13:04 - David;: Need a Brighton win for my accy
09/03/2019, 13:04 - David;: ¬£2,200 if today's results go my way
09/03/2019, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Living in a murray wonderland
09/03/2019, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: He hates palace
09/03/2019, 13:06 - David;: Wash you mouth out son, go get your father's gun, and shoot the palace scum, shoot the palace scum.
09/03/2019, 13:06 - David;: You feel we need it more than palace
09/03/2019, 14:02 - Hamish Sinclair: A goals been scored there
09/03/2019, 14:02 - Hamish Sinclair: HONK HONK HONK
09/03/2019, 14:05 - David;: Fuck off
09/03/2019, 14:05 - Jack G;: Was definitely knocked hard
09/03/2019, 14:05 - David;: He's caught hold of that
09/03/2019, 14:07 - David;: Doing a nice grotty number here
09/03/2019, 14:23 - David;: Dunk for England
09/03/2019, 14:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Dave what else in your accy ?
09/03/2019, 14:24 - David;: Ah well, so draw between Southampton Spurs is the biggest gamble
09/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: Then city to win later. Draw toon v Everton, draw leicester v Fulham, win for west ham v cardiff
09/03/2019, 14:26 - David;: And Bournemouth beating Huddersfield.
09/03/2019, 14:26 - David;: Easy
09/03/2019, 14:26 - David;: All sounds so plausible
09/03/2019, 14:30 - David;: I could cash in now for a 32p profit. But why would I do that when I'm about to win ¬£2,200?
09/03/2019, 15:55 - Jack G;: Should have taken the 32p
09/03/2019, 15:56 - David;: Yeah 32p looking like a great deal now
09/03/2019, 15:56 - Jack G;: Could get a chomp with that
09/03/2019, 15:57 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
09/03/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Spurs
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Jack G;: Very spursy
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: The title challenge
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Jack G;: Would be funny if they came 6th in a 3 horse race
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: Just little away trips to Liverpool and City to come
09/03/2019, 16:53 - Rob;: I suppose only one of United and Arsenal can gain 3 points of them tomorrow
09/03/2019, 16:55 - Jack G;: Pocchetino to Real Madrid please. Really damage them
09/03/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: Trying out Fleabag. Seems complete shit initially. 1 minute in
09/03/2019, 19:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah nah nah
09/03/2019, 19:52 - Hamish Sinclair: It's great
09/03/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: Turned it off
09/03/2019, 19:54 - Hamish Sinclair: You've pulled a shocker
09/03/2019, 20:00 - Phill: It's shit.
09/03/2019, 20:00 - Phill: 0/10
09/03/2019, 20:01 - Phill: It's like watching a foreign comedy. Too London based.
09/03/2019, 20:43 - / James Ball: I'm also not keen. Funny moments but I would say 4/10
09/03/2019, 21:01 - David;: I didn't love it 6.5/10
09/03/2019, 21:32 - / James Ball: œÄ/10
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes it's set in london
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Only fools and horses - too London centric
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Phill: Precisely.
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: The office - too slough centric
09/03/2019, 22:28 - Phill: The vibe.
09/03/2019, 22:28 - Phill: London is its own country. Like watching a Somalian comedy. No references. Sorry.
09/03/2019, 22:29 - Phill: The little third person/first person intersections wind me.
09/03/2019, 22:30 - Phill: Very London.
09/03/2019, 22:33 - Phill: Just staring at the word London after half a bottle of whiskey.
09/03/2019, 22:33 - Phill: Looks odd.
09/03/2019, 22:33 - Phill: >the brain
09/03/2019, 22:36 - David;: Fuck that first Rondon goal
09/03/2019, 22:36 - David;: >everton

10/03/2019, 11:53 - David;: ‚ùå
10/03/2019, 12:46 - Paul;: ‚ÄúHello new baby, goodbye perineum‚Äù
10/03/2019, 16:44 - Jack G;: Blooter
10/03/2019, 16:44 - Jack G;: Dat movement
10/03/2019, 16:47 - Sam;: Nah, terrible keeping.
10/03/2019, 16:48 - Jack G;: Best get rid of de gea
10/03/2019, 16:48 - Sam;: He best wake up
10/03/2019, 17:17 - David;: Solskjaer out
10/03/2019, 17:18 - Phill: >poonited
10/03/2019, 17:18 - Phill: The bounce is bounced.
10/03/2019, 17:24 - Rob;: Good match
10/03/2019, 17:24 - Rob;: But hard to enjoy. I hate big games
10/03/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: Notice-period Ramsey is still a good Ramsey
10/03/2019, 17:27 - David;: Makes it even more troll
10/03/2019, 17:29 - Rob;: I don't really mind the whole thing. I don't think we can pay him 400k a week, he's still putting the effort in while he's with us, good luck to him
10/03/2019, 17:30 - Paul;: Who on earth is paying him ¬£400k a week
10/03/2019, 17:30 - Rob;: Juventus, from June
10/03/2019, 17:30 - David;: That is madness
10/03/2019, 17:31 - David;: A decent but inconsistent centre mid
10/03/2019, 17:31 - David;: With an injury history
10/03/2019, 17:33 - Paul;: Never hear anything about him being good. Just always injured
10/03/2019, 17:33 - David;: How much is Ronaldo on?
10/03/2019, 17:34 - Sam;: Still worth 40/50 million. It just means he gets the money not arsenal. Classic miss management of contracts by arsenal
10/03/2019, 17:37 - David;: Lol Ronaldo gets ¬£540,000
10/03/2019, 17:37 - David;: Not even that much more than little aaron
10/03/2019, 17:59 - Phill: The 400k a week is only because they don't have to buy him off anyone
10/03/2019, 17:59 - David;: Penalty jeff
10/03/2019, 17:59 - Sam;: Scored
10/03/2019, 17:59 - Sam;: Never a pen
10/03/2019, 18:00 - Jack G;: Ol√©‚Äôs bubble has burst
10/03/2019, 18:00 - Rob;: Always a goal
10/03/2019, 18:01 - Jack G;: Pushed Lacazette over
10/03/2019, 18:06 - Rob;: Pogba should be off then if the ref had seen his head grab earlier
10/03/2019, 18:11 - David;: 'it would have taken them 30 minutes to get Paris out of their legs'
10/03/2019, 18:11 - David;: Sports science
10/03/2019, 18:14 - Sam;: Slight touch from Fred. Don‚Äôt know how lacazette suddenly looses the use of legs from a hand on the Lower back
10/03/2019, 23:24 - David;: Sari embarrassing himself now
10/03/2019, 23:26 - David;: Disrespectful - he must be gone end of season
10/03/2019, 23:27 - David;: Has managerial churn finally caught up with them

11/03/2019, 11:11 - David;: Just a way of trying to signal that you've got a Porsche without everyone finding it objectionable
11/03/2019, 13:49 - Stefan;: Would of been buggered without them
11/03/2019, 14:53 - Sam;: Maybe she was under threat of buggery so getting them back was a huge relief
11/03/2019, 15:17 - Sam;: BREAKING: ZIDANE TO RETURN TO REAL
11/03/2019, 15:39 - Jack G;: Zidane 2, electric boogaloo
11/03/2019, 15:50 - David;: Embarrassing for them
11/03/2019, 15:51 - David;: Not sure it will work given squad needs overhauling and new identity - he's not the person to do that
11/03/2019, 16:07 - Sam;: Strange that he wants back in. Made a call to bounce. Maybe the bunch is big, or maybe they‚Äôll actually let a manager have a say on the players he coaches
11/03/2019, 16:15 - David;: Let him headbutt whoever he wants
11/03/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/03/08/vegan-pie-scoops-top-award-causes-outrage-among-culinary-elite/

11/03/2019, 22:08 - Rob;: May's deals back on then probably
11/03/2019, 22:08 - Rob;: Sounds like she might have got a way out of the backstop
11/03/2019, 22:09 - Jack G;: Disappointing season finale
11/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Does it?
11/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Nothing concrete on BBC news being announced, just talks
11/03/2019, 22:14 - Jack G;: It could still be a load of bollocks just to try and force the deal through tomorrow
11/03/2019, 22:29 - Jack G;: Yep. Looks like they were over selling it. Lots of MPs not buying it and still unhappy
12/03/2019, 00:21 - David;: Fleabag not that funny
12/03/2019, 07:53 - / James Ball: Stephen Hawking going to "inspire" a new 50p coin design featuring a black hole
12/03/2019, 07:53 - / James Ball: BBC news says: "He joins an elite group of scientists to have appeared on coins, including Sir Isaac Newton and Charles Darwin."
12/03/2019, 07:53 - / James Ball: No need for Nobel Prize. It's all about dem coinz
12/03/2019, 08:47 - David;: Didn't one of his central arguments about information loss get discredited?
12/03/2019, 11:12 - Jack G;: Attorney General has said his previous legal advice remains unchanged. The deal is dead now surely?
12/03/2019, 11:15 - Phill: So the guy at work who gumps pate has one of those rubber bracelets on. Instead of LIVESTRONG on, it just says: DONER KEBAB. WHEN DO YOU EAT YOURS?
12/03/2019, 11:15 - Phill: You can't make this shit up.
12/03/2019, 11:17 - David;: Lol. >those rubber bracelets.
12/03/2019, 11:17 - David;: Very 2003
12/03/2019, 11:42 - David;: Butt blow for May
12/03/2019, 11:42 - Jack G;: I can see her attempting to pull the vote again now
12/03/2019, 13:04 - David;: Cox's Codpiece
12/03/2019, 14:02 - David;: Will be funny if no deal is rejected but extension is rejected
12/03/2019, 14:04 - Damian Rumble: May, "look we got the deal you wanted"

Cox, "lol only joking, it's still a piece of shit"
12/03/2019, 14:05 - Jack G;: Yeah May got fucked by Cox there
12/03/2019, 14:05 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
12/03/2019, 14:08 - David;: May sounding very haggard
12/03/2019, 14:08 - David;: Broken, simply dissolved
12/03/2019, 14:16 - Jack G;: I think she‚Äôs finally at the end of the line
12/03/2019, 14:17 - David;: We've said that before
12/03/2019, 14:18 - Jack G;: She doesn‚Äôt have anywhere to go now though. The vote will lose later, she can‚Äôt renegotiate anymore. She‚Äôs said she doesn‚Äôt want no deal or no brexit. She‚Äôs put herself in a lonely, dark corner
12/03/2019, 14:18 - David;: She'll just plow on with an extension
12/03/2019, 14:19 - David;: But difficult to see what that will acheive if EU refuse to open more talks
12/03/2019, 14:19 - Jack G;: But the EU gets to say how long any extension will be. Her Brexiteers will be pissed
12/03/2019, 14:20 - David;: It will likely be 3 months to avoid elections. And she could concoct some way of selling that as a way to renegotiate yet again.
12/03/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: No way the EU accept that. They want something substantial like a referendum, general election or dropping of her red lines to consider an extension?
12/03/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: They'll be unlikely to extend past 23 May because of the parliament elections. Unless her government falls.
12/03/2019, 14:22 - David;: She could say she'll go Norway and pivot away from ERG to peel off labour votes. But hard to see her wanting to do that
12/03/2019, 14:22 - David;: Think EU would accept extension if that was how presented however
12/03/2019, 14:22 - Stefan;: Any option she goes for will split her party, perhaps permanently
12/03/2019, 14:22 - Stefan;: Which could be the one upside of Brexit
12/03/2019, 14:23 - Jack G;: Embarrassing for her though if she‚Äôs wasted this long on her deal and it turns out she should have gone for a Norway type deal all along
12/03/2019, 14:23 - Sam;: Vice chair of 1922 committee says defeat will definitely lead to a general election.
12/03/2019, 14:23 - David;: They always close ranks when it poses an electoral threat though - e.g. backing her in Jan.
12/03/2019, 14:24 - Sam;: Old Charlie Walker warning of a genny
12/03/2019, 14:24 - David;: Lol, a genny
12/03/2019, 14:25 - Sam;: I‚Äôve got Shadow world in the 4.20 at aintree and Corbyn in the genny
12/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: by what mechanism? They've already fluffed it by mounting leadership challenge in December so cannot do again for a year now
12/03/2019, 14:26 - Sam;: Is genny process different to a leady challo though? Or same
12/03/2019, 14:26 - Jack G;: More defections from the party so that she has no majority even with the DUP
12/03/2019, 14:27 - David;: Can be the same if the new leader choses to seek a mandate. Otherwise yes can be done through motion of confy in the old government. But that would be pretty mental.
12/03/2019, 14:28 - David;: Could be a conservative-led confy motion in the gov, but pretty insane to have that against a government from your own party, and they already supported her in one only a month ago
12/03/2019, 14:30 - Jack G;: The TIGs would be screwed in a genny
12/03/2019, 14:31 - David;: haha
12/03/2019, 14:36 - Damian Rumble: I heard a rumor that may is considering rolling the GE dice once again. Would make sense as her party is fucked at moment and... In spite of that... The Tories have opened up a bit of a lead in the polls. Could use it to get her MPs to stand on the mandate of delivering her deal or fuck off if they don't want it.
12/03/2019, 14:36 - Jack G;: The public hate her deal though, risky strategy
12/03/2019, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: Not as much as they hate Corbyn though
12/03/2019, 14:39 - David;: More to the point, her party membership are all mental brexiteers so the selection process would result in a more brexity cohort of MPs
12/03/2019, 14:40 - Phill: CLIFF EDGE CLIFF EDGE CLIFF EDGE
12/03/2019, 14:45 - David;: Also May has already promised not to stand as leader in the next general election. So she'd have to go back on that somehow.
12/03/2019, 14:45 - Jack G;: I think she worded that cleverly though to say she won‚Äôt stand in the 2021 election
12/03/2019, 14:45 - Damian Rumble: I mean she had no problem going back on her first promise not to hold a general election in 2017
12/03/2019, 14:48 - David;: Yes but that was vaguely to the country and this was to her party so brexiters would be pissed.
12/03/2019, 14:48 - David;: She might say something like i'll fight it to gain popular mandate for deal and then step aside.
12/03/2019, 14:51 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I guess... I just wish we had a mechanism in which she could put a single issue to the public and get them make a binary choice to determine how to proceed...
12/03/2019, 14:52 - Jack G;: ‚ÄúBut having a second vote is undemocraric‚Äù she says whilst repeatedly bringing her deal back to the house
12/03/2019, 14:55 - Phill: Damo. You lost the referendum. Stop crying about it. God.
12/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/03/2019, 23:34 - Damian Rumble: May's voice when announcing the votes coming tomorrow. Like a death rattle...
13/03/2019, 07:38 - / James Ball: She's had a death rattle for a few years to be fair
13/03/2019, 10:00 - Sam;: Big game tonight. To have 4 English teams in the QF would be big. Returning to dominating Europe again like the mid 2000‚Äôs.
13/03/2019, 10:00 - Hamish Sinclair: Odds don't look good though
13/03/2019, 10:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Bayern have turned good all of a sudden
13/03/2019, 10:02 - Sam;: Yeah, they showed very little in the first leg though.
13/03/2019, 10:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Apparently they've made it to 7 of the last 8 Semi finals
13/03/2019, 10:03 - Sam;: Weeeeell.
13/03/2019, 10:03 - Hamish Sinclair: If Liverpool do get through, I bet all 4 English teams play each other
13/03/2019, 10:04 - Sam;: Ah so this is the first time since 10/11 season that there will be at least 3 English teams in the QF. 

On the flip side, if they do play each other it guarantees 2 in the SF
13/03/2019, 10:05 - Hamish Sinclair: As long as city don't win it in happy
13/03/2019, 10:07 - Jack G;: Yeah Pep saying he wants Bayern to go through was a bit unnecessary
13/03/2019, 10:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Hadn't seen that, prick
13/03/2019, 10:08 - Rob;: Surely he'd prefer Liverpool to have more Champions League games to concentrate on
13/03/2019, 10:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Love watching city and psg desperately throw money at champions league. Hopefully if some one can just beat them this season, they nay be banned by next season
13/03/2019, 14:33 - Jack G;: 6 fullbacks in this England squad seems excessive
13/03/2019, 14:35 - David;: Is it cause he seems to think Kyle walker is a centre back?
13/03/2019, 14:35 - Jack G;: Possibly. Also, Trippier over Wan-Bissika is a terrible decision
13/03/2019, 14:37 - Phill: I've heard of Wan-Bissaka, not Wan-Bissika
13/03/2019, 14:40 - David;: Trippier dining off the world cup buzz though
13/03/2019, 14:40 - David;: It's fair enough, you get a year after scoring a blooter in a semi
13/03/2019, 14:40 - Sam;: Full back to the future
13/03/2019, 14:42 - David;: The Full Back Monty
13/03/2019, 14:42 - David;: Full Back Metal Jacket
13/03/2019, 14:46 - Jack G;: How Stella got her fullback
13/03/2019, 17:12 - Sam;: Lel. Watching van gaal greatest hits and deep cuts. 

Mike smalling happened twice. Also called another player mike as well (Will Keane)
13/03/2019, 17:18 - Jack G;: Would watch, he‚Äôs great entertainment
13/03/2019, 17:19 - Jack G;: >my players were horny

13/03/2019, 17:47 - Jack G;: This was also a highlight
13/03/2019, 19:18 - Jack G;: They tried to make me go for no deal. I said no, no, no
13/03/2019, 20:17 - Phill: I don't get this shitty amendment.
13/03/2019, 20:17 - Phill: "we don't want no deal"
13/03/2019, 20:17 - Phill: You will been saying that for 2 years.
13/03/2019, 20:18 - Phill: Need a nice little civil war to flare up.
13/03/2019, 20:29 - Sam;: That is a quality goal from Man E
13/03/2019, 20:29 - Hamish Sinclair: The van dijk assist
13/03/2019, 20:29 - David;: He's taken a touch there
13/03/2019, 20:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Has given me a massive boner
13/03/2019, 20:30 - David;: A real piece of touch
13/03/2019, 21:18 - Damian Rumble: I don't know much about football but this is a really poor quality game
13/03/2019, 21:29 - Sam;: Ooooooo
13/03/2019, 21:29 - Sam;: And Lyon have a goal too!
14/03/2019, 10:26 - David;: Child sex abuse victims have criticised Boris Johnson for claiming police funding was being "spaffed up the wall" investigating historical allegations.

The Tory MP said in an interview with LBC that "an awful lot of police time" was spent looking at "historic offences and all this malarkey".
14/03/2019, 10:26 - David;: Courting the pro-peado vote.
14/03/2019, 10:27 - David;: Always a risky strategy
14/03/2019, 10:27 - Stefan;: Yeah but you can't please both the pro- and anti-paedo crowds
14/03/2019, 10:27 - Stefan;: Got to pick a side
14/03/2019, 10:29 - David;: Good to use the term spaffing in the context of sex abuse as well
14/03/2019, 10:34 - Phill: <Media omitted>
14/03/2019, 10:36 - Phill: <Media omitted>
14/03/2019, 11:24 - Sam;: seen this point  a lot this week - "Everyone raving about 50% English teams still in Europe. How many English players in the match-day squads? 5/18 Liverpool. 4/18 Tottenham. 6/18 United. 5/18 City. Poor."

So there's 20 english players in the knockout stage of the top competition in Europe? a national tourny squad is 23 - the proportion is irrelevant for me just the number
14/03/2019, 11:25 - Sam;: and some in the europa league as well with chelsea and arsenal
14/03/2019, 11:26 - Paul;: Are you butthurt?
14/03/2019, 11:27 - Damian Rumble: A very astute point
14/03/2019, 11:36 - David;: Yes, also people not putting that in comparative context. E.g. PSG first XI was only about 4 French players. None of Barcelona front 3 Spanish, in fact only 4 Spanish players in Barcelona first team last night, same number as in united team vs PSG.
14/03/2019, 11:36 - David;: In other words, that's bollocks
14/03/2019, 11:38 - David;: Only 3 Italian players in Juve starting team vs Athletico
14/03/2019, 11:43 - Sam;: Livid. Haters in the forums.
14/03/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: It's looking at the problem the wrong way around. Perhaps more English footballers should play abroad
14/03/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: So it's the foreign clubs' fault really
14/03/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Buy our players
14/03/2019, 11:51 - Sam;: Yeah, German clubs seem to be going for English youngsters the days. The Sancho effect
14/03/2019, 11:53 - David;: What you need is overall breakdown of all first XIs in the quarter final matches by nationality.
14/03/2019, 11:56 - David;: That's the relevant stat. Because also match day squad misleading because bench often has more up and coming academy products etc., doesn't mean they are necessarily key players. Mason Greenwood being on the United bench should not have the same weighting as Harry Kane being a nailed on starter.
14/03/2019, 11:59 - Phill: Why so nationalist?
14/03/2019, 11:59 - David;: Want England to win the world cup ennit
14/03/2019, 12:00 - Sam;: Obvs
14/03/2019, 12:00 - Sam;: What‚Äôs World Cup

15/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: Obvs City get spurs. Their draws are a fucking joke.
15/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: City Juve in the semis would be big though. Imagine City vs Juve and Liverpool vs United.

15/03/2019, 19:19 - Rob;: Jeremy thinks he'll make millions with the headline 3-0 Walcott when Theo Walcott turns 30
15/03/2019, 19:19 - Rob;: He turns 30 at midnight
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Paul;: What are you doing to celebrate?
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: What's that got to do with the scoreline of 3-0?
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: That's the wordplay
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: Not that he's 30
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: Unless I'm too pissed to see this
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: Three Oh is a shot pun on Theo
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Phill: Yeah
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Phill: So related to goals
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Phill: Not age
15/03/2019, 19:22 - Rob;: The big Three Oh is a way some people describe turning 30
15/03/2019, 19:23 - Rob;: There's nothing more to it than that, it's meant to be shit
15/03/2019, 19:23 - Phill: This gave me cancer.
15/03/2019, 19:24 - Rob;: Sorry
15/03/2019, 19:25 - Phill: It's ok. It's not your fault.
15/03/2019, 19:26 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
15/03/2019, 19:27 - Rob;: There's a bar that's rebranding itself as The Swan and Paedo and hosting a 3-O Walcott night
15/03/2019, 19:27 - Rob;: I'm not going
15/03/2019, 19:45 - Phill: The Swan and Paedo
15/03/2019, 19:45 - Phill: Such a good name for a pub
15/03/2019, 19:45 - Phill: Would drink
15/03/2019, 20:16 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
15/03/2019, 20:47 - Phill: <Media omitted>

15/03/2019, 20:53 - Paul;: Great music
15/03/2019, 20:56 - Phill: Lol how does Ronaldo have more goals than Messi
15/03/2019, 20:56 - Phill: The face when the narrative has led you believe that Messi is the GOAT
15/03/2019, 20:56 - Phill: <Media omitted>
15/03/2019, 20:57 - Phill: Ronald.GOAT
15/03/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Older though
15/03/2019, 21:01 - David;: No Messi is just 3 years younger
15/03/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: When Ronaldo is ded Messi will goal
15/03/2019, 21:01 - David;: At all equivalent ages Messi is ahead
15/03/2019, 21:13 - Phill: Nah Messi ded.
15/03/2019, 21:14 - Phill: Latest episode of partridge is 9/10
15/03/2019, 21:14 - Phill: >not spotting that all the players are different ages
15/03/2019, 21:14 - Phill: >assuming they all age at the same rate
15/03/2019, 21:14 - Phill: >being this baked
15/03/2019, 21:15 - Phill: >not caring because it's the first time you've been baked in months and you've cleared baked clearance from your job
15/03/2019, 21:15 - Phill: >tfw when back on the leaf
15/03/2019, 21:16 - Phill: <Media omitted>
15/03/2019, 21:17 - Phill: Messi goat. Carry on.
15/03/2019, 21:23 - Phill: But they do all age at the same rate.
15/03/2019, 21:23 - Phill: Fuck this.
15/03/2019, 21:23 - Phill: I'm out
15/03/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: Are you broken
15/03/2019, 21:26 - David;: Lol yeah I can see how that would be confusing. They do set the ages running at the same pace
15/03/2019, 21:26 - David;: So the cunts on the crane are off your back?
15/03/2019, 21:27 - David;: Rooney really grinds to a screeching halt
15/03/2019, 21:27 - David;: On for a better than Messi career at 22
15/03/2019, 21:30 - Phill: Crane cunts gone.
15/03/2019, 21:30 - Phill: Turns out everyone senior in the construction industry does kilos of coke anyway
15/03/2019, 21:31 - Phill: Been at the races in a corporate box all week and they're all just coked up constantly
15/03/2019, 21:31 - Phill: Half the senior managers got sniffed out by dogs on the way in
15/03/2019, 21:32 - David;: Have you got to the bit on partridge where he's practicing spanking technique on a child doll?
15/03/2019, 21:32 - Phill: Yeah just watched it.
15/03/2019, 21:32 - Phill: In tears.
15/03/2019, 21:33 - David;: Lol how did that pan out?
15/03/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Very Barry Bennel
15/03/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Just discarded by security like glasto
15/03/2019, 21:34 - David;: 'not an abbreviation. No it's not an acronym either. It's an initialism'
15/03/2019, 21:34 - Phill: Like QI
15/03/2019, 21:34 - Phill: Would bang Jenny.
15/03/2019, 21:36 - David;: Yeah yeah

16/03/2019, 09:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, I was had
16/03/2019, 09:52 - Rob;: it was posted by one of The Sun's reporters, I'm not sure it is
16/03/2019, 09:54 - Rob;: There's a phone shadow and it's today's Sun, so it's been done very well and quickly if so
16/03/2019, 09:56 - Hamish Sinclair: I don't think I've seen the episode where he does this, is it in the later ones?
16/03/2019, 09:57 - Rob;: A later series I think yeah

16/03/2019, 18:36 - David;: Swansea then
16/03/2019, 18:41 - Sam;: Lel, watching in the pub next to city fans,  waiting for the United game. A lovely little starter
16/03/2019, 18:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Are theybplaying a proper team?
16/03/2019, 18:42 - David;: Yeah, strong
16/03/2019, 18:43 - Sam;: And have now subbed on Stirling and aguero.
16/03/2019, 18:44 - Sam;: Fucking England. Has there every been a comeback from 31 nil down?
16/03/2019, 18:49 - David;: Are you broken?
16/03/2019, 18:51 - David;: Fuck just watched 1st goal. Swansea are Barcelona
16/03/2019, 18:51 - Sam;: Rugby Dave.
16/03/2019, 18:52 - Phill: DAT rugbay game.

16/03/2019, 18:58 - Damian Rumble: Rugby dave
16/03/2019, 18:58 - Damian Rumble: One of the most mental matches I've seen in a while
16/03/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: That march is the best thing ever
16/03/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: Of course it would turn into a grim visual metaphor for Brexit
16/03/2019, 19:00 - Rob;: 350 people trudging through a gale
16/03/2019, 19:03 - David;: Not interested
16/03/2019, 19:03 - David;: Too much buzz now
16/03/2019, 19:05 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2019, 19:09 - Rob;: It's going to turn into a humanitarian crisis
16/03/2019, 19:13 - Sam;: Swansea were absolutely robbed
16/03/2019, 19:22 - David;: Joke that var used for some games not others
16/03/2019, 19:33 - Sam;: Yeah can‚Äôt believe that. It‚Äôs the quarters. Surely that‚Äôs big enough
16/03/2019, 19:34 - Damian Rumble: This looks like the world's shitest illegal rave
16/03/2019, 21:09 - David;: Romero >De Gea
16/03/2019, 21:30 - David;: That fucking goal
16/03/2019, 21:41 - Sam;: We‚Äôve been beat fair and square tonight. Same as PEADOPOOL.
16/03/2019, 21:42 - David;: Yeah wolves are doing football in the cup
16/03/2019, 21:43 - David;: Looks to be a bit of a PSG hangover
16/03/2019, 21:44 - Sam;: Bit of hubris knocking about
16/03/2019, 21:44 - Jack G;: Tony Hubris
16/03/2019, 21:45 - David;: üëç
16/03/2019, 21:45 - David;: Is there any circumstance under which OGS doesn't get the job from here?
16/03/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: I don‚Äôt like to admit because I like the  fa cup but it doesn‚Äôt mean anything these days. It Only about the prem and CL.
16/03/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Loose top 4 from here and he won‚Äôt get the job
16/03/2019, 21:47 - Sam;: It would just look like a new manager bounce
16/03/2019, 21:49 - David;: Wow that's quite a high bar still
16/03/2019, 21:49 - David;: Far from certain
16/03/2019, 21:49 - David;: But dat positivity. Dat class of 92 nostalgic bullshit
16/03/2019, 21:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Agree that domestic cups are meaningless, and top 4 essential, but dont subscribe to this demand for trophys as the only measure of success
16/03/2019, 21:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Pochetino = big success
16/03/2019, 21:53 - Jack G;: Bet you‚Äôd be honking if you won the FA cup
16/03/2019, 21:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah it'd be good for the ride
16/03/2019, 21:55 - Hamish Sinclair: But meaningless
16/03/2019, 21:55 - David;: Don't agree fa cup meaningless, it's not binary in that way. Yes it means less than league or Europe. But more than league cup and about on par with 4th
16/03/2019, 21:56 - Jack G;: I think FA Cup is a great one for teams on a trophy drought too, gets that winning buzz back
16/03/2019, 21:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Would live Brighton to win the fa cup
16/03/2019, 21:57 - David;: E.g. that season Everton finished 4th and got dumped out in qualifiers. They would rather have had silverware to cap that era
16/03/2019, 21:57 - Sam;: The biggest thing tonight is Var
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, but I'm struggling to find another example where that's the case
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Sam;: No var at Swansea but var at wolves
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Jack G;: Remember when Wigan won the FA cup and for relegated in the same season. Where are they now?
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Sam;: Wot???
16/03/2019, 21:59 - Hamish Sinclair: In the lower leagues, 're living their cup run
16/03/2019, 21:59 - David;: Yeah but they would take that over scrotting around for 1/2 more relegation battles while winning nothing
16/03/2019, 21:59 - David;: Look at the fury at Puel this season for not caring about the cup
16/03/2019, 21:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Fa cup has more meaning outside top 4
16/03/2019, 22:00 - Hamish Sinclair: So for Leicester, wolves Brighton  etc it's important
16/03/2019, 22:06 - Jack G;: How many good moments has he actually given the fans though? A couple of nice wins in the champions league I guess. But they‚Äôve not even got to cup final and regularly embarrass themselves
16/03/2019, 22:07 - David;: Getting ahead of Arsenal in the league would have been big for Spurs fans
16/03/2019, 22:07 - David;: Decades of butt hurt alleviated
16/03/2019, 22:08 - Jack G;: Put that straight in the trophy cabinet
16/03/2019, 22:09 - Hamish Sinclair: I think this is my point, no trophys doesn't equal failure
16/03/2019, 22:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Jack -would you prefer west ham yo be spurs right now Or win a one off fa cup?
16/03/2019, 22:10 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd prefer to be spurs personally
16/03/2019, 22:11 - Jack G;: No idea tbh, never experienced any consistent quality football or a trophy
16/03/2019, 22:11 - Jack G;: FA cup would be great
16/03/2019, 22:11 - Hamish Sinclair: His is like that delayed gratification  experiment they did on children
16/03/2019, 22:12 - David;: False choice. You could win an FA cup in the context of improving generally and comibg 4th. Then the fa cup would be a great market of that era
16/03/2019, 22:12 - David;: *marker
16/03/2019, 22:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, but on it's own potentially meaningless
16/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Yeah maybe. It can crown and encapsulate a broader period of quality/sucess
16/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Which would feel empty without any trophy
16/03/2019, 22:13 - Hamish Sinclair: But that period of success is defined by other perameters
16/03/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Not the cup itself
16/03/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: The cup run is enjoyable in its self, but serves nonreal purpose or measure of progress
16/03/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: The footballing equivalent of a wank
16/03/2019, 22:15 - Jack G;: Perhaps footballers are less bothered about whether they get trophies these days as well due to getting a shit tonne of money
16/03/2019, 22:15 - David;: But you are more likely to win the cup due to being good generally. So it's related to that same improvement
16/03/2019, 22:15 - David;: And shows you have that ability to perform in key moments which is also a mark of great teams
16/03/2019, 22:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Fa cup couldn't save Wenger
16/03/2019, 22:16 - David;: Consistency alone isn't all about what defines good teams, that's why you need cup comps
16/03/2019, 22:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Which I think is the most damning evidence against it
16/03/2019, 22:17 - David;: E.g. Ronaldo is partly so good because he does it in key moments and finals.
16/03/2019, 22:17 - Jack G;: 3 FA cups too
16/03/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: Winning the FA cup, going to games in the run is great as a fan. Incredibly enjoyable even though the league or champs league would be better. And 6 of  Wenger's 7 wins came while also coming 4th and two doubles, so it's never felt like a binary thing of you either get a domestic trophy or you get a good league finish, just part of enjoying being a fan
16/03/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: But then on the flip side I actually enjoyed the Arsenal team a lot during the trophy drought. We had really excellent young players we'd brought through ourselves and played better football than we did in those last Wenger seasons with the 3 cups

17/03/2019, 18:03 - Rob;: Chelsea don't want to come fourth
17/03/2019, 18:04 - Phill: It's OK. They will put in a troll performance at Anfield and take points.
17/03/2019, 18:05 - Rob;: And maybe win the Europa League
17/03/2019, 18:25 - Jack G;: Sarri bit that isn‚Äôt happening
17/03/2019, 18:26 - Jack G;: But*
17/03/2019, 18:31 - David;: I'm Sarri?
17/03/2019, 18:43 - Sam;: A crumb comfort for me on this shitty little weekend
18/03/2019, 10:36 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2019, 10:37 - Stefan;: Love being treated like a 5 year old
18/03/2019, 10:38 - Rob;: They don't really flow in a logical order either, quite hard to interpret what they mean
18/03/2019, 10:38 - David;: Ha, such early 2000s clip art as well
18/03/2019, 10:39 - David;: But if they get you ticking nice little pictures you're not noticing the above-inflation price rises
18/03/2019, 10:40 - David;: Re-watched the matrix at the weekend. Spotted a massive plot hole. So the sun has been blocked out, and the machines start using the heat from people as a power source instead. How are the people being fed to provide the power with no sunlight? You can't replace a primary energy source with a secondary.
18/03/2019, 10:41 - David;: It's all bullshit, don't believe it really happened
18/03/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: Don‚Äôt they just get a mush
18/03/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: Patented mush
18/03/2019, 10:44 - Stefan;: Maybe everyone's eating the cyanobacteria that grow around volcanic vents on the seabed
18/03/2019, 10:44 - Stefan;: You could rustle a few good meals up from that
18/03/2019, 10:44 - David;: Probably similar in tase and nutritional content to Sam's mush.
18/03/2019, 10:45 - David;: But also it would never be more efficient to do that that use the bacteria directly as biomass energy. You are adding a stage up in the food chain.
18/03/2019, 10:46 - Phill: Synthetic light greenhouses.
18/03/2019, 10:47 - Phill: I've grown weed in the loft under LED's. No sun. Check.
18/03/2019, 10:48 - David;: But using lots of electricity in the process?
18/03/2019, 10:49 - David;: So rather than just using that electricity to power yourself, you use it to grow food that you then feed to humans that then generate heat that you turn into electricity to power yourself.
18/03/2019, 10:51 - Sam;: They liquidised the dead and feed them to the living. There‚Äôs a scene where they explain it
18/03/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: This is the explanation in the film, but you'd have diminishing returns
18/03/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Not enough people would die to feed the living, unless my never moving they expend so little energy as to make it efficient
18/03/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: The machines could have harnessed wind, wave and geothermal power efficiently to produce light to feed the plants to feed the humans to feed the machines
18/03/2019, 11:05 - Stefan;: *to feed the dead humans to feed the living humans to feed the machines
18/03/2019, 11:05 - Stefan;: Can't miss that step
18/03/2019, 11:06 - Rob;: Any the humans originally made the machines to feed to humans to make more machines
18/03/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: So the machines are eating and digesting now?
18/03/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: Or they just live off the body heat
18/03/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: What‚Äôs going on
18/03/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: Dave's completely right, it would always be more efficient to run a machine from a primary source than a secondary. The machines are losing out by enslaving humanity. Just in it for the trolling
18/03/2019, 11:17 - Jack G;: Machines with trolling and banter, picking up on humanities greatest traits
18/03/2019, 11:20 - David;: Wind is ultimately produced by the sun unevenly heating the world - wave and geothermal yes but still the efficiency problem.
18/03/2019, 11:20 - David;: Yeah exactly - trolling is the only legitimate explanation
18/03/2019, 11:22 - David;: Also if they're that fucking good can't they just unblock the skies?
18/03/2019, 11:23 - Paul;: Can they not work around the clouds? Build structures that penetrate the cloud layer?
18/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: Just build up a bit. High rise. Doesn't seem that complicated.
18/03/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: Yeah, they have no need for oxygen and can withstand cold, just go up
18/03/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: Or down, enjoy the mantle, it's yours
18/03/2019, 11:25 - David;: Nice mini break in the mantle
18/03/2019, 11:26 - David;: 5* on trip advisor for a winter getaway.
18/03/2019, 11:27 - Rob;: Why do machines need so much space anyway their their consciousnesses aren't bound to bodies. Like in Her - billions of 'beings' could occupy a very small space, maybe a single very efficient computer
18/03/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: They could all just have a nice chat
18/03/2019, 11:28 - David;: They're not those kind of machines Rob
18/03/2019, 11:29 - David;: Not the chatty type
18/03/2019, 11:29 - Rob;: They should just live in the Matrix, cut the humans out of it

18/03/2019, 11:30 - David;: Yeah 'we've built this amazing fantasy dreamworld but we're only going to use it for the race we've enslaved. We'll stay in the polluted dark shit hole of a world we conquered'
18/03/2019, 11:31 - David;: Maybe they have a better matrix they live in most of the time and they just do the human haresting etc. as the day job to keep the power flowing in
18/03/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: 'but it's the humans in their blissful ignorance who are the real losers here'
18/03/2019, 11:32 - Paul;: Breaking down the matrix is shitter than being in it
18/03/2019, 11:32 - Paul;: You‚Äôd be pissed off to be woken from the matrix
18/03/2019, 11:33 - David;: Think I would be the guy who was like fuck this I just want to go back into the Matrix rather than fight a terrifying war against unassailable robot overlords. I was doing just fine as an accountant back in the Matrix. Had just bought a new flatscreen. Had a holiday booked in the Canaries.
18/03/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: Yeah, and permanently living in a pre-climate change world. No need to worry about the future, teh machines will just turn it off and on again
18/03/2019, 11:58 - Paul;: So the whole plot of the matrix is just fucked now? So we can deduce we‚Äôre not living in a simulation?

18/03/2019, 14:01 - David;: 'select the suppliers' - only ¬£49 to take on some extra procurement work

Look, we've found out about this Matrix business, and we are pretty miffed, but how about you release a patch to end war, suffering and injustice, and give us all free speedboats and we'll call it even?'
18/03/2019, 17:14 - David;: They did explain that by saying they made a great version of it first and everyone was miserable
18/03/2019, 17:15 - David;: So the machines made it shittier for us because we hadn't made the most of it
18/03/2019, 17:15 - David;: So human nature fucked it up
18/03/2019, 17:16 - David;: But not too shitty that we would rebel. So we live in a world just shitty enough to seem real and where there are problems to solve but not so shitty that we rise up against it.

21/03/2019, 14:04 - David;: North Wales not having anything to do with it
21/03/2019, 14:05 - David;: Probably represents digital access as well as sentiment though. So urban constituencies instantly more likely to sign.

22/03/2019, 14:20 - / James Ball: It would be relatively complicated (but not impossible) to set up a bot system for this due to email verification. Also when the petitions are on this large a scale they tend to start to have monitored external verification. Ie 1000s of signatures from .ru email addresses will be ruled out

24/03/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: I definitely remember a conversation about bread where you dismissed sour dough as hipster nonsense and said it was too 'modern'

24/03/2019, 11:16 - Damian Rumble: Well I literally just finished Cumberland sausages, bacon with beans on sourdough toast so probably just extrapolate from that
24/03/2019, 11:22 - Paul;: What made you try sourdough though? You are normally far too stuck in your ways to do something as wild and adventurous as that

28/03/2019, 19:19 - Sam;: For me it‚Äôs a great hybrid between lager and ale. Flavour of ale, crispness of lager, but still very smooth

28/03/2019, 23:50 - Damian Rumble: Lol not a thing
29/03/2019, 10:03 - Damian Rumble: I imagine that when john Bercow is having sex with his wife, as he approaches climax, he starts bellowing "order! Orrrrddeeeeer!" At her.

29/03/2019, 12:14 - Damian Rumble: These are going to get butt raped by fptp so badly.
29/03/2019, 14:25 - Damian Rumble: Major arse clenching going on ahead of this third vote...
29/03/2019, 14:29 - Jack G;: Pretty confident it‚Äôs going to lose again by about 50
29/03/2019, 14:35 - Damian Rumble: Would be ideal if it got less than mps who voted for the people's vote, but I reckon it will be more
29/03/2019, 14:35 - Hamish Sinclair: How many voted for peoples vote?
29/03/2019, 14:36 - Jack G;: Would be good yeah but surely the deal is killed off by any loss. Can‚Äôt have a 4th vote on it
29/03/2019, 14:37 - Damian Rumble: I think it was 268
29/03/2019, 14:37 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm a bit confused. If they vote for it, do we leave ontime?
29/03/2019, 14:38 - Damian Rumble: If they vote for it we leave on the 22nd may
29/03/2019, 14:38 - Hamish Sinclair: And If we don't?
29/03/2019, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: Pass
29/03/2019, 14:39 - Jack G;: Probably a long extension and general election unless the indicative votes go well on Monday
29/03/2019, 14:43 - Jack G;: Loss by 58
29/03/2019, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: Good call @447746875764
29/03/2019, 14:48 - Rob;: Extension to mid April if we don't pass it
29/03/2019, 14:48 - Rob;: They gave us two dates, depending on which way it went
29/03/2019, 14:49 - Rob;: 12 April for the unconditional extension
29/03/2019, 14:50 - Damian Rumble: Well I guess Teresa gets to keep her job for the time being...
29/03/2019, 14:53 - Jack G;: 4th time lucky?
29/03/2019, 16:05 - Damian Rumble: Not with that margin and in only a handful of days
29/03/2019, 16:06 - Damian Rumble: Interesting that May said that "we are reaching the limits of this process in the house". Is she hinting at a referendum...?
29/03/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: Referendum would definitely just be another leave vote. All controls are set to troll. We'll never escape it
29/03/2019, 16:07 - Damian Rumble: Surely her only options are to hold a public vote on her deal or resign, hold a general election and get who ever wins that to start again?
29/03/2019, 16:15 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm hoping that common market 2.0 wins a majority in the indicative votes, it‚Äôs attached into the political declaration and we vote that through. Would need a medium term extension to get EU to amend the agreements though
29/03/2019, 16:26 - Stefan;: I think remain would win against any specific form of Brexit deal, rather the abstract idea of Brexit
29/03/2019, 16:27 - Stefan;: All the polls show it (and a pretty consistent albeit smaller lead for remain v. leave generally in the last year)
29/03/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: But you're forgetting the rule that everything you love will die and everything you hate will triumph
29/03/2019, 16:28 - Jack G;: But they‚Äôll be a campaign, could easily convert a load of people back with the ‚Äúbetrayal of the people‚Äù mantra
29/03/2019, 16:29 - Stefan;: Ah yes, that does tend to get in the way of things
29/03/2019, 16:42 - Jack G;: Must be a butt blow to Leadsom that the government was embarrassed so close to Mother‚Äôs Day
29/03/2019, 17:54 - David;: So we're heading for a little Gennie?

31/03/2019, 17:24 - Paul;: So what is kosher salt if not for the Jew?
31/03/2019, 17:25 - Phill: Salt sans iodine
31/03/2019, 17:27 - Phill: The term Kosher salt gained common usage in North America and refers to its use in the Jewish religious practice of dry brining meats‚Äîknown as koshering or kashering‚Äîas opposed to the salt itself being manufactured under religious guidelines.
31/03/2019, 18:13 - Jack G;: Missoko

31/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: <Media omitted>
01/04/2019, 13:00 - David;: Lol, Morelos. 5 red cards this season.
01/04/2019, 13:02 - David;: The suspensions on that.
01/04/2019, 13:29 - Rob;: Hard to see how he's had the chance to get sent off so much, considering how suspensions will have limited his playing time
01/04/2019, 13:37 - David;: Theoretical maximum straight red cards would be 10 - 3 games suspended each time and then the game you get sent off in each time would be 37 games.
01/04/2019, 13:37 - David;: So he's at half that
01/04/2019, 13:37 - David;: Although looks like one was in Europe
01/04/2019, 13:42 - David;: Presumably you'd need to be scoring a hat-trick and winning the match in each of the games you got sent off in to justify re-election every time. Would be quite a season
01/04/2019, 13:49 - Rob;: He may also have received additional suspensions for getting 5 yellows in either or both halves of the season
01/04/2019, 13:51 - David;: I'm imagining just 10 hat-trick match-winning performances but with a violent conduct straight red in each.
01/04/2019, 13:52 - David;: No yellows. One huge lash-out at 80 minutes every time he plays.
01/04/2019, 13:52 - David;: But undroppable

02/04/2019, 13:27 - Jack G;: And guess what the first things the EU will ask us for in the trade negotiations will be. ¬£39 billion and the Irish backstop. It‚Äôs utterly pointless self harm

03/04/2019, 11:20 - Damian Rumble: Watched Laura kuenssberg's Brexit documentary last night. Would recommend
03/04/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: Yeah the clandestine little meetings she has with people are interesting
03/04/2019, 11:26 - Rob;: They all clearly try to use her as much as she uses them
03/04/2019, 11:34 - Damian Rumble: I enjoyed the way all the politicians are straight on the phone to her leaking after every meeting.... It's like watching 'the thick of it' all over again
03/04/2019, 11:42 - David;: Was a good watch but didnt think it gave much additional insight - not exactly a secret that party discipline has completely disintegrated.
03/04/2019, 11:44 - David;: Main take away was that Steve Baker is a weird little bloke and will never vote for the deal.
03/04/2019, 11:44 - Rob;: Was he the won who kept affecting tears and a lump in his throat?
03/04/2019, 11:45 - David;: Yeah, and has a bit of a Joe Hill vibe
03/04/2019, 11:47 - David;: *Joe Taylor.
03/04/2019, 11:47 - David;: Key difference
03/04/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Yeah big Taylor vibe
03/04/2019, 11:50 - David;: Has a very inflated sense of his importance - definitely imagines himself as a Churchillian figure.
03/04/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: Steven John Baker
03/04/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: RAF engineer. Classic self importance raising job

03/04/2019, 12:39 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I thought it was bizzare timing really. Surely it would have made more sense to bring out the documentary after Brexit was sorted. Feels like they rushed the more recent bits (though that is probably symptomatic of the overall sense of chaos at the moment)
03/04/2019, 12:40 - Jack G;: Feels like it will never be sorted though. We‚Äôll just be stuck in a never ending brexit purgatory
03/04/2019, 12:40 - Damian Rumble: Or should that be de ja Vue. I'm sure I remember may calling a press conference in Jan where she proclaimed she was going to persuade labour to back her deal

03/04/2019, 12:42 - David;: >de ja Vue
03/04/2019, 13:41 - David;: Rob you need to do a piece of investigative food journalism exposing sour dough fraud. It's everywhere.
03/04/2019, 13:42 - David;: People seem to be using the term sourdough to mean 'quite nice bread' as if no one will notice
03/04/2019, 13:42 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
03/04/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: I find out about quite a lot of misleading food stuff
03/04/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: Tesco are obviously awful
03/04/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: I have been toying with contacting private eye
03/04/2019, 13:45 - Rob;: Like most supermarkets, their sour dough is just bread with yogurt in it to make it taste like it
03/04/2019, 13:45 - David;: Sour dough especially susceptible though, because people have heard about the buzz but have no idea what it really means
03/04/2019, 13:45 - Rob;: Tesco currently being very dodgy about how they advertise their use of sustainable cocoa
03/04/2019, 13:46 - David;: And it's actually pretty difficult to make at scale so big incentive for fraud
03/04/2019, 13:47 - David;: I'd be willing to guess more than 50% of bread sold as sourdough is not sourdough
03/04/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: Lots of that kind of thing about
03/04/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: More British honey is sold than produced
03/04/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: Same with sustainable-certified palm oil
03/04/2019, 13:49 - David;: Why do they not get called out by the standards agencies?
03/04/2019, 13:51 - Rob;: Fraud tends to happen further up the supply chain than the checks, before any regulation can happen
03/04/2019, 13:52 - Rob;: Primark got done for unknowingly buying real fur disguised as fake sfuff
03/04/2019, 13:52 - Paul;: It‚Äôs like when we were eating horse meat

05/04/2019, 18:24 - David;: Follow up question: would you lose the three points from the derby game if it meant city win the league but you miss out on champs league?
05/04/2019, 18:53 - Sam;: City to win the league because Liverpool fans are the worst. Insufferable. City fans don‚Äôt know how to celebrate, not used to being good but Liverpool fans will go on about this for a generation.
05/04/2019, 18:53 - Hamish Sinclair: But what about the future of football Sam?
05/04/2019, 18:53 - Phill: So bitter.
05/04/2019, 18:53 - Paul;: Follow up to the follow up. 6th FC go down to league 2. Are you a villa fan again?

05/04/2019, 18:55 - Phill: So plastic.
05/04/2019, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd rather utd win the champions league over city
05/04/2019, 18:56 - Sam;: Yeah well obviously we‚Äôre a real club. It‚Äôs the fans that ruin it for anyone wanting PEADOPOOL to win
05/04/2019, 18:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Rise above it
05/04/2019, 18:57 - Sam;: Not PEADOPOOL
05/04/2019, 18:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Otherwise we have a generation of watching city win the league with a half empty stadium
05/04/2019, 18:57 - Jack G;: As soon as Pep leaves city are fucked
05/04/2019, 18:58 - Phill: When he hears that champions League theme,
Plastic Sam is there on time.
Putting on his villa shirt and scarf,
In less than six seconds flat.
He's always on the scene.
Plasti  Sam!
And his shirt is bright and clean.
Plastic Sam!
You can not ignore,
Sam is the bitter next door.
Honking down the busy streets,
Greeting city fans that he meets.
City could be in a jam,
So, hurry hurry Plastic Sam
05/04/2019, 18:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Depends who replaces him
05/04/2019, 18:58 - Hamish Sinclair: They can essentially pick whichever manager they want
05/04/2019, 18:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Particularly If they start winning in the chamions league
05/04/2019, 18:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Celebrated this at the time
05/04/2019, 18:59 - Jack G;: How many managers at the level of Pep are around though? Barely any. They‚Äôll have a big slump at the end of his tender. Got to grab that opportunity
05/04/2019, 18:59 - Jack G;: Tenure*
05/04/2019, 19:01 - Sam;: I had to pick one and fuck PEADOPOOL. City aren‚Äôt a real club so it doesn‚Äôt matter.

05/04/2019, 19:28 - Paul;: What type?
05/04/2019, 20:51 - Phill: Question
05/04/2019, 20:52 - Phill: Which horse is 1 horse power calibrated to?
05/04/2019, 21:39 - / James Ball: It wasn't, horses were calibrated to it

07/04/2019, 19:24 - Rob;: 'Sounds like the perfect candidate. Don't bother with an interview. Tell him he can start tomorrow'
07/04/2019, 19:26 - David;: 'You don't think I should just run the backround checks - see if his name appears on the Mordoor spies registry?'
07/04/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: 'Nope, and tell that Chris Truthsworth chap he's fired'
07/04/2019, 19:30 - David;: I mean his CV did had huge gaps on it - that exactly co-incided with him moving to Minas Morgul. But you're confident about this?
07/04/2019, 19:31 - David;: Reference supplied was a Mr A. Nazgul.

07/04/2019, 19:41 - Rob;: Nobody cares for the woods any more
07/04/2019, 19:41 - David;: I've got the master sword Rob. That's just mine now.
07/04/2019, 19:42 - Rob;: Ah yeah, great for keeping other weapons in good conditions
07/04/2019, 19:42 - Rob;: And for those pesky guardians
07/04/2019, 19:45 - David;: So I opened 2 bottles of wine to aerate before I knew I was going out on friday. Then poisoned myself. So now having to work through the wine. More of a chore than anything.
07/04/2019, 19:46 - David;: But also really taking the edge off
07/04/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: Solo two bottles?
07/04/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: Big sleep risk there

07/04/2019, 21:13 - Phill: Just what you want to find the day of a hangover.
07/04/2019, 21:13 - Phill: Two open bottles of red.
07/04/2019, 21:14 - Damian Rumble: I see your two bottles of red and raise you the two gallons of cider that I drank yesterday (or at least that is what it feels like)
07/04/2019, 21:14 - Phill: Can you read?
07/04/2019, 21:19 - / James Ball: I call bullshit. You can't have consumed more than your own volume
07/04/2019, 21:21 - Damian Rumble: Having just googled that the human body contains only one gallon of blood that seems a  reasonable assessment haha!
07/04/2019, 21:22 - Phill: How much is a gallon?
07/04/2019, 21:22 - Phill: Ah 4.5 litres
07/04/2019, 21:23 - Phill: Seems a reasonable amount of booze
07/04/2019, 21:23 - Phill: 8 pints
07/04/2019, 21:24 - / James Ball: I just meant that Damo's total volume is less than 2 gallons
07/04/2019, 21:25 - David;: So he drank half his own blood volume?
07/04/2019, 21:25 - / James Ball: Double
07/04/2019, 21:27 - David;: I guess you are constantly pissing
07/04/2019, 21:27 - / James Ball: Damo not thicc enough to have more volume
07/04/2019, 21:27 - David;: He was more cider than man by the end
07/04/2019, 21:29 - / James Ball: It's possible he was maybe going pelican and storing it all in a neck pouch to digest as required
07/04/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: We've all drunk way more than 2 gallons in an evening
07/04/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: Or in a day at least
07/04/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: 16 pints. It's been known to happen
07/04/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: Sam on the Stella cans
07/04/2019, 21:33 - / James Ball: Not saying it's impossible for a regular human
07/04/2019, 21:34 - Rob;: Right, just a 2D one
07/04/2019, 21:36 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure how I feel about the prospect that a 'normal' human can regularly drink more their own volume of blood in booze in a single sitting...
07/04/2019, 21:36 - Damian Rumble: https://www.itv.com/news/2019-04-07/brexit-latest-theresa-may-extension-eu-emergency-summit-donald-tusk/?fbclid=IwAR37VYUNZngvLVO0DXY0kyGBrV2OWKDiLDij_McNgQ1JLiJmkVJhxMWAnDg

08/04/2019, 09:44 - David;: I get into work this morning and my arse just collapses
08/04/2019, 09:53 - David;: Fuck just watching FA cup highlights. Deloufeu
08/04/2019, 10:36 - Phill: Yeah DAT first goal
08/04/2019, 12:41 - Paul;: I need more details around this
08/04/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Feel like this would be a huge Wales conversation
08/04/2019, 12:47 - / James Ball: Essentially your mouth and anus are directly linked via pipe. If you were 2D rather than 3D a pipe would be drawn as just two unconnected parallel lines thus dividing you in half.
08/04/2019, 12:48 - David;: 'fun fact'
08/04/2019, 12:49 - / James Ball: One for parties and funerals
08/04/2019, 12:49 - Paul;: So you get to see the digestion and shit generation in action
08/04/2019, 12:49 - Stefan;: Presumably then you'd only have blood and air supply on one side of your body
08/04/2019, 12:49 - David;: But hold on your anus is connected to itself
08/04/2019, 12:50 - / James Ball: Nahh, two lungs mate
08/04/2019, 12:50 - David;: At all points
08/04/2019, 12:50 - Paul;: Cut down middle one lung only
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: I suppose this is only a problem if you're 2D in a 3D world
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Stefan;: You've only got one mouth and one heart - they've got to be on one side, but the airways and blood vessels can't cross to the other side
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Stefan;: Because of the mouth-anus divide
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Paul;: Shit pipe blocks all
08/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Essentially you'd be a walking CT scan
08/04/2019, 12:52 - / James Ball: And Israel and Palestine think they've got it rough
08/04/2019, 12:52 - David;: I was thinking more like if you unwrapped a human and flattened it to 2d form. This seems more like taking a 2d cross-section
08/04/2019, 12:53 - / James Ball: 2d cross section is how you'd appear in the second dimension
08/04/2019, 12:53 - Stefan;: Lol
08/04/2019, 12:53 - Stefan;: Unwrapping a human
08/04/2019, 12:54 - / James Ball: Ie we perceive the 4th dimension (time) as continually changing snapshots or "slices" if you will
08/04/2019, 12:54 - David;: Hold on - fly in the ointment. The top of the head above the mouth is still connected to both sides
08/04/2019, 12:55 - / James Ball: Ah yes that is true but still fundamentally divided in haf
08/04/2019, 12:55 - David;: So everything would have to flow through the brain
08/04/2019, 12:56 - / James Ball: I guess a 2d being would perceive us as tentacle monsters
08/04/2019, 12:56 - David;: Huge bottleneck in the brain with having to process all bloodflow from side to side
08/04/2019, 12:56 - / James Ball: With a large central brain at the top
08/04/2019, 12:57 - Rob;: Have you read Flatland, James?
08/04/2019, 12:57 - David;: The downward pressure would quickly mean the two sides seperated so that you are supported on the floor by either sides of your intestines and at the center by the roof of your mouth.
08/04/2019, 12:58 - / James Ball: Have not - should I?
08/04/2019, 12:58 - Stefan;: I suppose the shit pipe could have valves or gateways to let the air and blood vessels cross over. I.e. shut the shit gates, open the blood gates, and vice versa
08/04/2019, 12:59 - / James Ball: I like that this has now become a design consultation - "the perfect 2D human"
08/04/2019, 12:59 - / James Ball: We need more shit valves
08/04/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: It's basically this conversation, but with geometric shapes that can't handle the concept of other dimensions
08/04/2019, 13:01 - David;: But couldnt open all the blood gates at once otherwise intantly split down the middle again. So have to open them one at a time to let shit through like canal locks
08/04/2019, 13:01 - Rob;: Slaughterhouse 5 also relevant
08/04/2019, 13:01 - David;: Quite tenuous - that's more to do with time being non-linear
08/04/2019, 13:02 - Rob;: But the bit where he talks to the aliens about how they experience time as a dimension they can move through is relevant
08/04/2019, 13:03 - David;: Do not recall the shit pipe problem being covered extensively
08/04/2019, 13:04 - / James Ball: Is only covered by the finest theologians
08/04/2019, 13:04 - / James Ball: The shit pipe paradox
08/04/2019, 13:08 - David;: So just revisiting the human centipede on wikipedia
08/04/2019, 13:08 - David;: 'When approaching investors prior to filming, Six did not mention the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of The Human Centipede did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete.'
08/04/2019, 13:08 - David;: Good to commission that without realising.
08/04/2019, 13:09 - Sam;: That‚Äôs great. Watching the final cut and not knowing what‚Äôs coming
08/04/2019, 13:10 - David;: Thought it was a rom-com
08/04/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Pitched as a remake of Kafta's Metamorphosis
08/04/2019, 13:21 - Stefan;: "We were led to believe it was a children's cartoon about a loveable anthropomorphic centipede"
08/04/2019, 13:21 - David;: Lol
08/04/2019, 13:21 - David;: But have to release it to recoup the money
08/04/2019, 13:26 - Rob;: Huge product placement
08/04/2019, 13:27 - Rob;: The cotton firm who paid to have their product used was furious
08/04/2019, 13:29 - Stefan;: So who financed the sequel? No room for doubt there
08/04/2019, 13:30 - David;: They were probably just living arse to mouth
08/04/2019, 13:56 - Paul;: Can we get some diagrams explaining the 2D shit pipe conundrum
08/04/2019, 14:02 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 14:11 - Damian Rumble: This throws my whole understanding of Mr Game and Watch in to disrepute...
08/04/2019, 14:11 - / James Ball: I'm glad this is being properly documented
08/04/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Turn the head 90 degrees and youd have your seperation
08/04/2019, 14:12 - / James Ball: Skull still connects both sides above the mouth though
08/04/2019, 14:14 - / James Ball: Shit pipe - divides body in half
Skull - exists
08/04/2019, 14:14 - David;: Ah yes but the skull in 2d is only a lining around the top of the head
08/04/2019, 14:15 - David;: Don't get the back or front
08/04/2019, 14:15 - / James Ball: Would still connect both sides from whatever angle surely
08/04/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: How do you do arms?
08/04/2019, 14:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Put head at 90 degrees
08/04/2019, 14:20 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 14:21 - Rob;: No penis here
08/04/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: Yeah this is how I pictured it
08/04/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: Dave in your version he can't eat, if he's living in a 2D world
08/04/2019, 14:22 - Stefan;: Can't get food across the edge of his face to the mouth hole
08/04/2019, 14:27 - / James Ball: Ah right yes, I was imagining it differently
08/04/2019, 14:27 - / James Ball: Extra points for the dong
08/04/2019, 14:35 - Paul;: Surely you wouldn‚Äôt separate
08/04/2019, 14:37 - Paul;: If you cut a pipe in half you still get left with wall of the pipe holding its structure
08/04/2019, 14:37 - Rob;: Can you eat 3D food if you're a 2D being?
08/04/2019, 14:37 - Paul;: Structure would still count?
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Paul;: Even if 2D
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Paul;: Or does it dissolve and you‚Äôre destined to float apart
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Rob;: Yeah, your enzymes rely on their 3D structure to work
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Rob;: Your haemoglobin wouldn't be able to carry oxygen in 2D
08/04/2019, 14:39 - / James Ball: It would still be carrying it in 3D you just wouldn't know that if you were a 2d being witnessing it
08/04/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 15:34 - Rob;: Very true
08/04/2019, 15:56 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 15:56 - David;: Solved the problem
08/04/2019, 15:57 - David;: Can get food in through the ear canals
08/04/2019, 15:57 - David;: So then he actually becomes 3 strips
08/04/2019, 15:57 - David;: Top of head is a small also detached surface
08/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: Just use one ear?
08/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: Still retain hearing
08/04/2019, 16:00 - David;: Could use 2, that's just an artists impression
08/04/2019, 16:01 - David;: For educational purposes
08/04/2019, 16:09 - Damian Rumble: How's that postdoc going Dave?
08/04/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: A friend at work plays D&D
08/04/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: She's just been telling me that last night they found out one of the people they play with, an old school friend, has spent months laying into them all on a D&D forum
08/04/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: Personal attacks as well as criticism of how they play it etc
08/04/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: And it's been hard not to laugh
08/04/2019, 17:23 - Rob;: But basically they've been making this guy dinner every week and having a laugh, and he's been like 'look at these absolute noobs'
08/04/2019, 17:23 - David;: She
08/04/2019, 17:23 - David;: That's a surprise in itself
08/04/2019, 17:23 - Rob;: Yeah, yeah. She bucks the trend. I was quite surprised to learn
08/04/2019, 17:24 - David;: Mate said he was going round to someone's house at the weekend to play a game that you can only play once because you break the game as you play it
08/04/2019, 17:25 - David;: Sounded very intense and meta
08/04/2019, 17:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Is that pandemic?
08/04/2019, 17:35 - David;: No, I've played that at veritys that's the co-op one
08/04/2019, 17:36 - David;: Youre all coordinating to fight the disease
08/04/2019, 18:01 - Sam;: Arsenals away from is baffling. Title winning home form this season and last. Mid table away from home
08/04/2019, 18:04 - Rob;: I can bring Pandemic to Wales
08/04/2019, 18:04 - Paul;: Can you also bring a pandemic
08/04/2019, 18:16 - Rob;: It's strange that it has continued across two mamagers
08/04/2019, 22:07 - Damian Rumble: @447752458076  - legal question for you. I recently was sent a letter detailing outstanding debt for PCN I 'received' in Cardiff in 15/06/2018. The first I knew about this was when this letter (dated 21/02/2019, delayed because it was sent to my old house) arrived, over 8 months after the offense. They are provided no evidence or explanation of the offense but I can track my movements on google maps and clearly demonstrate that whilst I drove along the road in question on that date, I did not park at any point and hence was not given any ticket at the time. I have sent them all this information. Do you think this is the kind of thing I could successfully appeal in court if need be?
08/04/2019, 22:10 - Jack G;: Could have been driving in a bus lane?
08/04/2019, 22:10 - David;: PCN's are a massive shit storm - outsourced to a private agency so you can never get hold of anyone to talk to about it. We had a thing where our car got stolen and racked up
08/04/2019, 22:11 - David;: PCNs where it was left. Took fucking ages to deal with. They are complete cunts.
08/04/2019, 22:11 - David;: Unaccountable.
08/04/2019, 22:29 - Stefan;: I have no idea tbh. Never worked on PCNs and I don't know what the process is
08/04/2019, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: 5 years of law school for nothing
08/04/2019, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: lol
08/04/2019, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: cheers though
08/04/2019, 23:19 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 23:20 - Stefan;: Important to know exactly how many people got shat on. Glad they took time to do the headcount
08/04/2019, 23:21 - Rob;: Yeah that's excellent
08/04/2019, 23:22 - Rob;: Perhaps like when an atrocity unfolds there were initial, lower reports of the shitted-upon, and it slowly climbed to this point
08/04/2019, 23:29 - Stefan;: "The number of confirmed beshitted is currently 11, but this is an initial estimate and could rise significantly as further reports come in"
08/04/2019, 23:52 - David;: 'many more are reported missing but at this stage any hopes by their loved ones that they avoided a shit smearing appear increasingly forlorn'
09/04/2019, 08:16 - Damian Rumble: https://www.sexolution-festival.com/ just going to leave this here...
09/04/2019, 08:18 - Paul;: Going to be full of fat basement dwellers. Bet
09/04/2019, 09:17 - Sam;: Of course it‚Äôs German. The fiends
09/04/2019, 10:10 - Paul;: Bbc praising fleabag finale as ‚Äúperfect‚Äù - rob can you elaborate?
09/04/2019, 10:11 - Paul;: ‚ÄúOne fan said they were so impressed with one of the characters speeches in the final scenes, that they typed it out and might even print it out and put it in a frame‚Äù
09/04/2019, 10:14 - David;: Thought it was poor. It's got annoying and smug and self-satisfied now
09/04/2019, 10:15 - David;: The buzz got to it
09/04/2019, 10:34 - Rob;: Why me?
09/04/2019, 10:35 - Paul;: You‚Äôre Yentob
09/04/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: And big hype man of fleabag
09/04/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: Buzz raiser
09/04/2019, 10:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Thought it was an above average episode but a terrible end of season episode. Tied up nothing and seemed very chuffed with that
09/04/2019, 10:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Had it been the penultimate episode I'd have given it a 8/10
09/04/2019, 10:44 - Rob;: I enjoyed the series about as much as the first
09/04/2019, 10:47 - Rob;: The level of coverage has been a bit mad for a sit com, but you can't let buzz ruin you enjoying a show
09/04/2019, 10:56 - Paul;: Buzz ruins all
09/04/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: Being so buzz-averse is basically being a snob
09/04/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: You're allowed to like popular things
09/04/2019, 11:00 - David;: Nah but buzz is not popularity - it's where something becomes too big to fail.
09/04/2019, 11:01 - David;: Don't like things that you have to like because they are too big to fail.
09/04/2019, 11:03 - Stefan;: Dave, watching sitcoms isn't like banks and the financial crisis
09/04/2019, 11:05 - David;: There's a lot of moral hazard around fleabag - critics feel they can support it because the taxpayer/public will bail them out as buzzer of last resort.
09/04/2019, 11:05 - Sam;: We all have to like fleabag in order to keep Barclays afloat
09/04/2019, 11:05 - David;: So the buzz is being mispriced
09/04/2019, 11:06 - Rob;: I just enjoyed watching it and I'm quite glad I'm not watching TV in the way you are Dave
09/04/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: It sounds exhausting
09/04/2019, 11:07 - Sam;: Thorgan, Eden and Moral
09/04/2019, 11:07 - David;: Well I'm mainly not watching.
09/04/2019, 11:07 - Sam;: The brothers Hazard
09/04/2019, 11:16 - Paul;: Robs going to default on his buzz soon
09/04/2019, 11:17 - David;: 'Sub-prime buzz prices will never fall' - Rob Goodway, August 2008
09/04/2019, 11:21 - Paul;: Line of duty, anyone been watching that?
09/04/2019, 11:27 - Paul;: About to get surrounded by buzz. But predictable plot. Same old shite
09/04/2019, 11:42 - Damian Rumble: Dave. Such a hipster. The moment something becomes mainstream it is ruined. TV. Music. Bread. Where will it end?
09/04/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: I don‚Äôt think you understand the buzz
09/04/2019, 12:34 - David;: Buzz ‚â† Popularity
09/04/2019, 12:39 - / James Ball: Buzz = people telling you to like something and it becoming popular because it's popular not because it's actually groundbreaking or good
09/04/2019, 13:25 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>

09/04/2019, 20:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Honk
09/04/2019, 20:15 - David;: Hib
09/04/2019, 20:17 - David;: Porto are a team of troll fake names
09/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: Torres, Suarez and Danillo
09/04/2019, 20:18 - Phill: DAT marega.
09/04/2019, 20:18 - Phill: So quick.
09/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: None of them the actual versions of those players
09/04/2019, 20:23 - David;: They also have Pereira, Costa and Dos Santos on the bench - not the ones you would expect
10/04/2019, 11:41 - Paul;: Sam, united going to throw the city game so Liverpool can‚Äôt win?
10/04/2019, 11:43 - David;: Would be very embarassing for them but they have the small club mentality that would make them do that.
10/04/2019, 11:44 - David;: Contented being the second biggest club in their town.
10/04/2019, 12:09 - Jack G;: >town
10/04/2019, 12:44 - David;: >Mark Francois
10/04/2019, 12:44 - David;: His chubby little punchable face
10/04/2019, 12:46 - Jack G;: He‚Äôs such a gammon
10/04/2019, 12:54 - David;: Old Toilet vs Barca tonight then
10/04/2019, 12:54 - David;: Small game
10/04/2019, 12:54 - Jack G;: Looking forward to seeing what faces Messi can make Phil Jones pull
10/04/2019, 13:39 - David;: Damo is your anus ready for the black hole picture?
10/04/2019, 13:40 - David;: Is your shit hole ready for the black hole?
10/04/2019, 13:42 - Stefan;: So pumped to look at a photo of nothing
10/04/2019, 13:43 - Stefan;: But which contains everything
10/04/2019, 13:50 - David;: Will it not just be black surrounded by black? Could be underwhelming
10/04/2019, 13:51 - Paul;: Surely an April fools that‚Äôs gone too far?

10/04/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: Lol
10/04/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: 6 years to produce this
10/04/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: Looks like it was taken with a disposable camera. 0/10
10/04/2019, 14:24 - David;: '"Wow - they've really done it!" said Professor Reynolds. "I really didn't expect the image to be as clear - just like the computer simulations"'
10/04/2019, 14:33 - Paul;: lol complete piece of shut
10/04/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: *shit
10/04/2019, 14:37 - Paul;: ¬£40m for that
10/04/2019, 14:38 - David;: Value
10/04/2019, 14:39 - Paul;: An Andy Carroll
10/04/2019, 14:48 - / James Ball: I'm not sure what people were expecting. Clearly not the headline that "black hole appears as lightless black disc on film"
10/04/2019, 14:51 - Rob;: They had a huge build up to it, a long press embargo, which usually means it's going to be good
10/04/2019, 14:51 - David;: Yeah, just quietly release it. Bad expectation management
10/04/2019, 14:52 - / James Ball: God, the BBC's reporting of it is fucking wank
10/04/2019, 14:52 - / James Ball: It's a "million trillion" km away
10/04/2019, 14:52 - / James Ball: You're not Brian Cox
10/04/2019, 14:53 - Paul;: Looking to justify their existence with all these scientific things now they lost Pluto
10/04/2019, 14:53 - David;: Lol, 'lost pluto'
10/04/2019, 14:54 - David;: They got the photograph of that though
10/04/2019, 14:54 - David;: Less lost than it has ever been
10/04/2019, 14:55 - / James Ball: They sent a craft specifically towards it
10/04/2019, 14:55 - Paul;: Pluto got demoted
10/04/2019, 14:56 - / James Ball: True but it's still around
10/04/2019, 14:56 - David;: Yeah, nothing about it changed. That was scientists changing their own classification system.
10/04/2019, 14:56 - David;: Not like they were desperately trying to hold onto it but told they could no longer have it.
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: It is quite small
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Paul;: It‚Äôs shit. Tiny. Get rid
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: Although I don't remember that particular photo being taken
10/04/2019, 14:57 - David;: Would be good if it was actually put there. Brazil having to deal with that.
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt believe they got away with calling it a planet

10/04/2019, 14:59 - / James Ball: You don't mind if I leave my minor planetoid here so you - I'll only be a minute
10/04/2019, 14:59 - David;: Dat sphere though. Round m8 - not an asteroid is it?
10/04/2019, 15:00 - David;: I miss pluto being a planet, it was a planet back in my day. It's political correctness gone mad.
10/04/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: Also, getting pluto as it's god when it turns out it has a heart on it is shit
10/04/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: It should have been Venus
10/04/2019, 15:05 - Rob;: And Neptune not having any seas is shit
10/04/2019, 15:06 - David;: So blue though. Perfect.
10/04/2019, 15:06 - Rob;: You'd redo most of the names
10/04/2019, 15:06 - Stefan;: Jupiter - not very jolly
10/04/2019, 15:06 - David;: blue and flat - classic sea-like vibe
10/04/2019, 15:06 - Stefan;: Has a massive storm that's been going for hundreds of years
10/04/2019, 15:06 - David;: Mercury works, Mars works. Lock those down.
10/04/2019, 15:07 - Rob;: Saturn is more jolly with its rings, yet to be saturnine is to be gloomy
10/04/2019, 15:07 - David;: But jupiter the god of thunder. Ideal.
10/04/2019, 15:07 - David;: Lots of thunder knocking about up there.
10/04/2019, 15:13 - Rob;: So what's the light being emitted?
10/04/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: Just gas it's pulling in, apparently
10/04/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: Thank god for the bright gas
10/04/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: ‚ÄúAt the event horizon, light is bent  in a perfect loop around the black hole, meaning if you stood there you would be able to see the back of your own head‚Äù
10/04/2019, 15:18 - Stefan;: That "if" is doing a lot of heavy lifting there
10/04/2019, 15:19 - David;: Frousting down into an event horizon
10/04/2019, 15:19 - David;: Waking up really hungover and you're perched on an event horizon
10/04/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: The time dilation would turn it into a thousand year froust
10/04/2019, 15:20 - / James Ball: Probably travelling at near light speed with infinite mass to boot
10/04/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: The infinite froust
10/04/2019, 15:22 - Paul;: Didn‚Äôt we already have one of those?
10/04/2019, 15:22 - / James Ball: Infinite mass after an infinite froust sound quite plausible
10/04/2019, 15:22 - David;: Jack, you wake up on brutally hung over and you're in a small swimming pool with a humpback whale. How do you deal with it?
10/04/2019, 15:23 - David;: We had the thousand year balloon
10/04/2019, 15:24 - Jack G;: I assume the black hole has somehow transported me into an alternate dimension, hopefully a utopian one
10/04/2019, 15:25 - Rob;: Since that balloon I've always felt like the people in Inception who've lived entire lifetimes within their own conciousness
10/04/2019, 15:25 - Rob;: There was that other long one where Damian cried out 'FUCCKKKKK' at the height of it and it lasted for decades

10/04/2019, 16:17 - Paul;: A funner fact than splitting in half via anus to mouth in 2D world
10/04/2019, 16:18 - Stefan;: Great hallucination.
10/04/2019, 16:18 - Stefan;: A cocktail of psychedelics and all your mind produced was a some fuzzy green around a black circle

11/04/2019, 14:16 - David;: Um, hello. Answer to the question please
11/04/2019, 14:17 - David;: Listening. A slow burner. 10.22 long.
11/04/2019, 14:21 - Damian Rumble: I saw a paper a while back on the stars around Sagittarius a* (the smbh in the milky way). I'll see if I can dig it up.
11/04/2019, 14:22 - David;: üëç

11/04/2019, 14:27 - David;: If we were on one of those orbiting stars would we be able to deal with it?
11/04/2019, 14:27 - David;: Would we even notice?
11/04/2019, 14:27 - Damian Rumble: https://www.eso.org/public/unitedkingdom/news/eso0846/
11/04/2019, 14:27 - Damian Rumble: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/S2_(star)
11/04/2019, 14:29 - Damian Rumble: "S2 is a star that is located close to the radio source Sagittarius A*, orbiting it with an orbital period of 16.0518 years, a semi-major axis of about 970 au, and ... coming no closer than about four times the distance of Neptune from the Sun.
11/04/2019, 14:29 - Damian Rumble: There's your answer
11/04/2019, 14:30 - Paul;: Can you translate it into a real answer?
11/04/2019, 14:31 - David;: That makes sense. Still quite close - orbiting every 16 light years. Big risk of being sucked into the event horizon there surely
11/04/2019, 14:31 - David;: Big froust on S2, observing the black hole in the sky
11/04/2019, 14:31 - David;: *years
11/04/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: Do we have a planet we can froust on though?
11/04/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt froust on a star
11/04/2019, 14:35 - David;: There must be a litttle planet knocking about around it
11/04/2019, 14:35 - David;: A grotty hot jupiter or something
11/04/2019, 14:37 - Paul;: We can just settle in there?
11/04/2019, 14:42 - David;: Given a recent estimate of 4.31 million M‚òâ for the mass of the Sagittarius A* black hole and S2's close approach, this makes S2 the fastest known ballistic orbit, reaching speeds exceeding 5,000 km/s (11,000,000 mph, or 1/60 the speed of light) and acceleration of about 1.5 m/s2 (almost one-sixth of Earth's surface gravity).
11/04/2019, 14:42 - Rob;: Maybe in winter you would be ominously closer to the black hole
11/04/2019, 14:42 - David;: Would be frousting at 1/60th the speed of light
11/04/2019, 14:45 - David;: In 2012, a star called S0‚Äì102 was found to be orbiting even closer to the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole than does S0-2. At one-sixteenth the brightness of S0-2, S0-102 was not initially recognized because it required many more years of observations to distinguish it from its local infrared background. S0-102 has an orbital period of 11.5 years, even shorter than that of S0-2.
11/04/2019, 14:46 - David;: Very close that.
11/04/2019, 14:47 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/04/2019, 14:48 - David;: Excellent froust vantage point. Few bevvies and watch the black hole going past
11/04/2019, 14:50 - Rob;: Would orbiting a sun that's orbiting a black hole with a big disc of glazing gas around it mean you don't have a regular day/night cycle
11/04/2019, 14:51 - Rob;: *glowing gas
11/04/2019, 14:52 - Damian Rumble: I think that might be the least of your problems...
11/04/2019, 14:52 - Damian Rumble: 120 X as far as the earth is from the sun
11/04/2019, 14:55 - David;: What would be the main problems?
11/04/2019, 14:56 - David;: Don't see the issue
11/04/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: As long as you're just far out enough not be sucked in, what problems is it actually causing?
11/04/2019, 14:58 - David;: Would be fine, can't forsee any problems
11/04/2019, 14:58 - Jack G;: Just wear a space suit, will be fine
11/04/2019, 14:59 - Rob;: You just get to see loads of gas whizzing around and a big black disc of nothing/everything
11/04/2019, 15:00 - Damian Rumble: Probably the continuous stream of x-rays/gamma rays coming out of the super heated infalling mater as it crosses the event horizon
11/04/2019, 15:00 - David;: Ah. Well.
11/04/2019, 15:01 - Rob;: But that's 12x further away than the sun
11/04/2019, 15:01 - David;: Just more to look at.
11/04/2019, 15:01 - Rob;: And nothing escapes an event horizon, famously
11/04/2019, 15:01 - David;: X-Rays used in medicine anyway - good for you if anything
11/04/2019, 15:02 - David;: Would just see through everyone it would be a good gimick for the night
11/04/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: Yeah. A world where you'll spot a broken bone with ease
11/04/2019, 15:03 - David;: 120 - even safer
11/04/2019, 15:05 - Rob;: You probably struggle to even get a tan
11/04/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: Is your anus ready for the James Webb space telescope?
11/04/2019, 15:21 - / James Ball: Because your skin would melt off due to radiation?
11/04/2019, 15:22 - / James Ball: Didn't realise Assange was carried out of the embassy like a pasty battering ram
11/04/2019, 15:22 - / James Ball: Thought he walked out
11/04/2019, 15:31 - David;: No. Directly observing exoplanets. Can't get close to that
11/04/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Probably going to have the capability to detect life on other planets... If they ever build the damn thing...
11/04/2019, 15:41 - David;: Why aren't we already targetting radio messages to the nearest habitable-looking exoplanets
11/04/2019, 15:42 - David;: Just get the ball rolling, they'll take ages to get there anyway
11/04/2019, 15:42 - Paul;: Good point
11/04/2019, 15:47 - Rob;: I think we're doing a bit of that
11/04/2019, 15:47 - Rob;: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_interstellar_radio_messages?wprov=sfla1
11/04/2019, 15:48 - Rob;: What would you say, if you were writing an interstellar message?
11/04/2019, 15:55 - Paul;: One of our messages we sent won‚Äôt arrive until 25974
11/04/2019, 15:55 - Paul;: Sent it in 1974
11/04/2019, 15:57 - Rob;: So if they reply immediately we'll hear back in 3174?
11/04/2019, 15:58 - Rob;: No, lol
11/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: In 49974
11/04/2019, 15:58 - Rob;: Would be great if they spend ages learning an earth language so they could reply, then we can't understand it by the time it arrives
11/04/2019, 16:05 - Damian Rumble: If there were any intelligent lifeforms within a reasonable distance to us we would have already have picked up thier passive Comms (for example TV and radio) by now (and them us)
11/04/2019, 16:08 - Rob;: Only if they're further ahead technologically by the number of light years away they are
11/04/2019, 16:09 - Rob;: If they're 9999 years ahead technologically but 10,000 light years away we'll get it next year
11/04/2019, 16:10 - Rob;: Or maybe they sent it to use before we built anything to receive it
11/04/2019, 16:13 - Rob;: Could be a lot of life that's been and gone
11/04/2019, 16:16 - David;: I read somewhere that untargetted signals like that would only be detectable 0.25 light years away so not enough to pick up
11/04/2019, 16:18 - David;: They could well have died out in the time it takes for their reply signal to get here anyway.
11/04/2019, 16:20 - David;: But this is fuck all. 20 in total over decades. We should be constantly spamming out messages to the nearest ones. Go for volume.
11/04/2019, 16:24 - Rob;: Do TV and Radio signals just get spaffed out?
11/04/2019, 16:24 - Damian Rumble: Take all of the shit memes @447540496004  has produced on the thread and channel it straight at  alpha centuri. It's the strongest signal we have...
11/04/2019, 16:26 - David;: No, they don't go out far enough - not the sufficient strength etc.
11/04/2019, 16:29 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/04/2019, 16:29 - David;: This is one we sent out in 1974 apparently. Would tell you fuck all.
11/04/2019, 16:29 - David;: Would not respond to that piece of shit if I was an alien
11/04/2019, 16:35 - Stefan;: How can it be indefinitely dense but also have a measurable size (which is a lot bigger than the solar system)?
11/04/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Sorry?
11/04/2019, 16:36 - Paul;: Rather straightforward once you know how to read it

The ex-Tanfield Chambers advocate told officials that terrorists had retrieved a nuclear weapon from a sunken Russian submarine and were plotting an attack on Her Majesty during the 2012 London Olympics"
11/04/2019, 16:49 - David;: Pass
11/04/2019, 16:49 - Stefan;: Can't understand why he failed
11/04/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: Shrimpy
11/04/2019, 16:59 - Paul;: lol his Wikipedia page is complete chaos
11/04/2019, 17:03 - David;: Lol yeah there's a lot going on there
11/04/2019, 19:31 - Sam;: Kane is fucked
11/04/2019, 19:31 - Sam;: Might not even be back for uefa nations
11/04/2019, 19:32 - Jack G;: Rashford striker no problem
11/04/2019, 19:32 - Jack G;: Dat Rashford, Sancho, Sterling front three
11/04/2019, 19:33 - Sam;: Yeah, could unleash them, like Son for spurs.
11/04/2019, 19:34 - Sam;: The done side of the traditional CF like Kane, others find it harder to flourish unless they are supporting the CF

11/04/2019, 19:34 - Jack G;: Yeah definitely. With a striker like Kane got to build the team around him or he is anonymous

11/04/2019, 20:16 - Jack G;: Would watch again
11/04/2019, 20:30 - Sam;: Fair few millios taken off of koulibalys value there
11/04/2019, 20:32 - Jack G;: Down to a measly 98 million then
11/04/2019, 20:33 - Jack G;: Wonder how it effected the petrol index
11/04/2019, 23:05 - David;: Alli as well
12/04/2019, 08:59 - Paul;: Lol, sun reporting Assange was engaging in dirty protests at the embassy. Whiffyleaks
12/04/2019, 09:12 - Paul;: Only place in the world you‚Äôre safe. Best to shit everywhere
12/04/2019, 09:29 - / James Ball: Well he had been there for 7 years, he must have been griming up the walls

12/04/2019, 10:20 - Rob;: Which he might serve anyway
12/04/2019, 10:20 - Rob;: He had a cat though
12/04/2019, 10:35 - Paul;: Apparently they got fed up with him. He was skateboarding and playing football in the corridors. Also he smelt of shit. Said he had bad hygiene one very unpleasant related to digestion
12/04/2019, 10:38 - David;: >skateboarding
12/04/2019, 10:39 - Paul;: A shitty man living in your house for 7 years
12/04/2019, 10:40 - David;: 'after spending seven years in the country's embassy he had dismissed Ecuador by describing it as an insignificant country'
12/04/2019, 10:40 - David;: Also unwise
12/04/2019, 10:41 - Paul;: High levels of autism
12/04/2019, 10:43 - David;: Just had a 7 year froust. That catches up on you
12/04/2019, 10:44 - Rob;: But in someone else's workplace
12/04/2019, 10:45 - Rob;: A place where everyone else tends to dress very smartly

12/04/2019, 12:17 - Sam;: Nah they‚Äôre a staple. Penguin for mains, Rocky for pudding
12/04/2019, 12:25 - / James Ball: False. Penguins are up there
12/04/2019, 12:26 - / James Ball: Club and rocky also good
12/04/2019, 12:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Penguin, cut of opposite corners and use it as a straw to suck tea through üëå
12/04/2019, 12:27 - / James Ball: Witchcraft
12/04/2019, 12:27 - Paul;: What‚Äôs your top tier?
12/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: Wait explain the logistics on this
12/04/2019, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: You end up with a perfectly formed tea soaked biscuit, better than it sounds
12/04/2019, 12:29 - David;: you'd need to hollow out the centre
12/04/2019, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah just suck
12/04/2019, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Also works with other chocolate covered buscuits
12/04/2019, 12:29 - David;: Hmm, might need to see photographic evidence
12/04/2019, 12:32 - Jack G;: Kit Kat, Snickers
12/04/2019, 12:32 - Sam;: Of Hamish sucking on his biscuits?
12/04/2019, 12:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Can you no suck tea through a nougat based snack
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Mars bar/snickers = disaster
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Jack G;: Being able to suck tea through it not really a selling point for me
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Paul;: Fucking mental
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Paul;: Do you even chocolate jack
12/04/2019, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: 1. Double decker
2. Boost
3. Twirl
12/04/2019, 12:34 - David;: You've lost your mind
12/04/2019, 12:35 - David;: Galaxy Ripple - very under-rated.
12/04/2019, 12:35 - Paul;: Starbar
12/04/2019, 12:35 - Jack G;: Just a worse version of a twirl
12/04/2019, 12:35 - Paul;: Twirl is like dry husks of wheat. Ripple is sophisticated
12/04/2019, 12:36 - David;: Nah, richer and more cloying
12/04/2019, 12:36 - David;: yeah yeah, creamier.
12/04/2019, 12:36 - David;: The best chocolate bar of all time has in fact been discontinued - the cadbury snowflake
12/04/2019, 12:38 - Sam;: Used to enjoy a fuse back in the day
12/04/2019, 12:41 - David;: was that with little fizzy bits of honeycomb in?
12/04/2019, 12:42 - David;: Spira's were good - also discontinued
12/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Snickers and Mars are sugary, American mess.
12/04/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: Lion bar
12/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: I do have a soft spot for an Aero but it needs to be fridge cooled
12/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Lion bar is underrated
12/04/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Kit Kat chunky is a proper undertaking
12/04/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: I have always enjoyed a Twix. Often good value in a vending machine scenario thanks to its double bar structure
12/04/2019, 12:53 - Damian Rumble: Heresy
12/04/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Very dense but I think I liked them a lot
12/04/2019, 12:54 - / James Ball: I used to go swimming and end with a twix or a wagon wheel from the vending machine. I still enjoy both but they make me hallucinate the smell of chlorine. Memories.

12/04/2019, 12:57 - Paul;: Yorkie = trash, picnic = trash
12/04/2019, 12:59 - / James Ball: Yorkie has definitely fallen by the wayside for me over the years. I don't have enough picnic experience
12/04/2019, 12:59 - Rob;: How extreme do you reckon those Chewit Xtremes are?
12/04/2019, 12:59 - David;: The Reese peanut cups can get incredibly close. So much sugar.
12/04/2019, 13:00 - / James Ball: PB cups are addictive. Wispa is pretty god tier for me
12/04/2019, 13:01 - Jack G;: Wispas go down well. Anything with caramel is a no from me
12/04/2019, 13:11 - David;: Yeah wispa is a solid choice
12/04/2019, 13:11 - David;: absolute worst thing is Cadbury fruit and nut
12/04/2019, 13:11 - David;: Would rather eat ash

12/04/2019, 13:19 - Paul;: >Milkyway
12/04/2019, 13:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Would prefer Cadbury fruit and no nut

12/04/2019, 14:20 - David;: Refreshing burst of coconut what's not to like?
12/04/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: If I want to be refreshed I‚Äôd have an orange not a chocolate bar
12/04/2019, 14:22 - Rob;: I'd have a drink
12/04/2019, 14:23 - Sam;: Has any ever pissed back through their legs, stood up? 10/10. would recommend
12/04/2019, 14:24 - Rob;: Thanks for the tip
12/04/2019, 14:24 - Rob;: I did piss through Paul's legs while he was pissing that time
12/04/2019, 14:25 - Sam;: Should have tried it with you both backwards
12/04/2019, 14:25 - David;: Like an awful family circus act
12/04/2019, 15:21 - Damian Rumble: No
12/04/2019, 15:22 - Damian Rumble: This from a man who likes to cook his pizza by leaving out in the sun for 5mins...
12/04/2019, 15:31 - David;: I decline to take culinary advice from a cider-filled pringles can.

12/04/2019, 15:45 - Phill: Dave's favourite flavours: 
Raw bacon
2-minute pizza, cooked upside down
Marmite and butter paste
12/04/2019, 15:46 - David;: Where's the pizza thing come from? I would never underdo a pizza unless horribly pissed

12/04/2019, 15:48 - Jack G;: Sounds disgusting, get a pasta sauce at least
12/04/2019, 15:49 - Paul;: Ketchup = pasta sauce
12/04/2019, 15:49 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs a condiment
12/04/2019, 15:50 - Paul;: Tomatoes. Sauce. Pasta.
12/04/2019, 15:50 - Jack G;: Enjoy your shitty meal
12/04/2019, 15:50 - David;: That is great. Doesn't sound like it but it works.
12/04/2019, 15:51 - Rob;: Show that to the Italians
12/04/2019, 15:51 - David;: Also this would have been when we were c. 12 or 13
12/04/2019, 15:51 - Rob;: Here's what we did with your national dish
12/04/2019, 15:52 - David;: I'd shove their shitty fries and weak tea right back in their face
12/04/2019, 15:52 - Rob;: We made sure to cook the pasta until it was white, bloated and mushy
12/04/2019, 15:53 - David;: Also you've embarrassed yourself because simple pasta toppings are now all the rage.
12/04/2019, 15:55 - David;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fettuccine_Alfredo
12/04/2019, 15:56 - David;: case in point. just have it with butter and cheese.
12/04/2019, 15:56 - Jack G;: There‚Äôs no arguement for this Dave. Pasta and ketchup is clearly and abomination
12/04/2019, 15:56 - Damian Rumble: I definitely remember @447526575752 describing Dave as liking his pizza 'enemic' one wales
12/04/2019, 15:56 - Damian Rumble: Agreed
12/04/2019, 15:58 - Hamish Sinclair: *anaemic
12/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: You don‚Äôt even eat real food. Only just discovered bread
12/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: Pasta ketchup and cheese is too high brow for your simple tastes
12/04/2019, 15:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Enemic would suggest "like an enema" which visually would be quite different
12/04/2019, 15:59 - David;: It's okay, we know.
12/04/2019, 15:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Truly awful
12/04/2019, 16:00 - David;: You keep the pasta al dente and put a bit of butter in as well. Parmesan on top.
12/04/2019, 16:08 - Phill: With Dave on this. Sorry, plebs.
12/04/2019, 16:13 - David;: https://www.justonecookbook.com/ketchup-spaghetti-recipe/

There are a few theories of how Spaghetti Napolitan (or Naporitan) or Ketchup Spaghetti originated.  The strongest theory is that it‚Äôs originated in Yokohama during the post war.  Around 1950s, the head chef at the New Grand Hotel in Yokohama created this recipe when he was inspired by the spaghetti and tomato sauce dish served for the American military. Since tomato sauce was a rare ingredient, so ketchup was used as a substitute for the pasta. He then named it Spaghetti Napolitan, or napoli, after Naples, Italy.

These newly westernized dishes like Spaghetti Meat Sauce and Spaghetti Napolitan received amazing responses that they became mainstays in the cafes and Japanese home kitchens. To this day, the two dishes are still two of the most popular western influenced pastas in Japan.
12/04/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: Agree with al dente pasta with simple toppings 100%, just not ketchup
12/04/2019, 16:15 - Rob;: Not being influenced by the Japanese on that
12/04/2019, 16:16 - Paul;: Stay pleb
12/04/2019, 16:17 - Jack G;: Even a can of chopped tomatoes with salt & pepper is a hundred times better than ketchup
12/04/2019, 16:18 - Jack G;: Bit of basil
12/04/2019, 16:18 - Rob;: Ketchup is 22% sugar
12/04/2019, 16:18 - David;: Rise to become head chef at the New Grand Hotel and then get back to me. Next.

13/04/2019, 15:12 - Phill: Are you using a premium, artisan ketchup or Heinz?
13/04/2019, 15:13 - Phill: Red liecester as well. DAT sweet richness.
13/04/2019, 15:21 - David;: I went with some artisanal ketchup sourced from my local italian-run independent food store. Lurpak spreadable counter-balances the sweetness of the ketchup while the red Leicester adds a British twist to this classic japanese-italian fusion dish.
13/04/2019, 17:48 - David;: Never a pen
13/04/2019, 18:02 - Jack G;: Used to it, refs hate us
13/04/2019, 18:16 - David;: The backpass rule shouldn't be based on intent. Discuss.
13/04/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: How would you judge a deflection?
13/04/2019, 18:19 - Rob;: Because if a backpass is just any ball off your own player, then a keeper might have to parry a goal-bound deflection when they could catch it
13/04/2019, 18:19 - David;: Yeah I guess. I just think there are so many examples of people deliberately miscuing it - benefit of the doubt always seems to go with the defender
13/04/2019, 18:20 - Rob;: Yeah, there are moments like that
13/04/2019, 18:21 - David;: Maybe only exception is where the ball is goal bound before the defender touches it
13/04/2019, 18:21 - Phill: How to judge intent? Lawyer in the VAR room?
13/04/2019, 18:21 - David;: Deals with deflections
13/04/2019, 18:21 - Hamish Sinclair: The rule was brought in to stop easy possession football patterns of keeper to full back, full back to keeper etc
13/04/2019, 18:22 - David;: Yeah that's what I mean though - why it should be changed as can never be properly enforced as it is
13/04/2019, 18:22 - Rob;: It would also be a bit shit if you make a goal-saving tackle and the ball spills out and the keeper has to control it with their feet with players looking for a tap-in
13/04/2019, 18:23 - David;: Would make for excitement and more goals
13/04/2019, 18:23 - Phill: 6 yard box, keeper can use hands, 18 yard box keeper can't.
13/04/2019, 18:23 - David;: Keepers would have to be better with their feet
13/04/2019, 18:23 - Phill: Whatever the scenario
13/04/2019, 18:24 - Phill: Can do pass backs if keeper in 6yd box
13/04/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: New rule: you can now only score from your own half
13/04/2019, 18:26 - Rob;: Unless it's a bicycle kick or perineum shot
13/04/2019, 18:30 - David;: That would be good
13/04/2019, 18:44 - Phill: 6th FC

13/04/2019, 21:46 - Phill: Listening to LoTR on audiobook
13/04/2019, 21:46 - Phill: Keep falling asleep and getting woken up at 2-3AM with the narrator singing one of the bouncy hobbit poems that's like 50 stanzas long
13/04/2019, 21:46 - Phill: Trolly
13/04/2019, 21:47 - Paul;: >That hobbit audio book second hand recording from the 60‚Äôs
13/04/2019, 21:50 - Phill: Just saw an ad for pepper
13/04/2019, 21:50 - Phill: Why does pepper need an ad?
13/04/2019, 21:50 - Phill: Who's not buying pepper?
13/04/2019, 21:51 - David;: More competition from other seasonings now
13/04/2019, 21:52 - Phill: That big sumac drive in 2018 really must have hit pepper sales...
13/04/2019, 21:54 - Phill: Salt must still be going strong. Global warming really good for salt. The salt lobbyists must be loving it.
13/04/2019, 21:55 - David;: Accidentally bought tellicherry pepper the other week without realising. Fucking disgusting shit.
13/04/2019, 21:55 - David;: How do they get away with calling that pepper?
13/04/2019, 21:55 - Phill: Always the risk you run when you shop off piste

13/04/2019, 21:58 - Phill: Some garbage called carob.

13/04/2019, 21:59 - David;: No, they're fucking rank. Citrus and flowery. May as well be eating cloves.
13/04/2019, 22:00 - David;: also, incorrect that they are left on the vine longer. That's a common misconception: https://reluctanttrading.com/blogs/the-reluctant-blogger/18993899-tellicherry-peppercorns-vs-regular-malabar-black-pepper-whats-the-difference

13/04/2019, 22:01 - Phill: Can stick up for Dave here. Was in an ottolenghi recipe. Bought it. Filth.
13/04/2019, 22:01 - Phill: Like a shit blend of cinnamon, clove and nutmeg.
13/04/2019, 22:02 - David;: They just taste like that christmasy mulled wine/clove flavour. Not what I want from pepper
13/04/2019, 22:02 - Damian Rumble: Chope & bone
13/04/2019, 22:03 - Phill: Also tried seaweed seasoning as a replacement for salt. Eating it is how I imagine it feels to be a united supporter. Flavourless and missing something essential: life.
13/04/2019, 22:04 - Phill: Also deeply unsatisfying.

13/04/2019, 22:10 - Rob;: I went coastering in N Ireland last year and our guide was giving us different edible seaweeds. There was one that was great. Pepper dulce I think
13/04/2019, 22:10 - Rob;: Maybe it's better fresh
13/04/2019, 22:11 - Phill: Seaweed is fine fresh. In its own right. But when some cunt says "try this dries seaweed instead of salt" they can castrate themselves.
13/04/2019, 22:11 - Rob;: Salt and pepper don't need to be replaced
13/04/2019, 22:11 - Rob;: Added to, fine
13/04/2019, 22:12 - Phill: Salting the seaweed is fine.
13/04/2019, 22:12 - Phill: Seaweeding the salt is not.
13/04/2019, 22:14 - Rob;: Back on pepper, it's mental that back in like 1500 someone in Europe ate a red bell pepper and thought 'this is just like those bitter, hard, almost spicy little black balls we call pepper, I'll call it that too'
13/04/2019, 22:22 - Damian Rumble: https://m.facebook.com/BuzzFeedUK/photos/a.598006600227500/2725196590841813/?type=3&sfnsn=xwwa&funlid=c1388hQZjyoFtlSt
13/04/2019, 22:25 - Phill: Tunnocks being anywhere near god tier
13/04/2019, 22:27 - Rob;: I back that shit tier though
13/04/2019, 22:30 - David;: Have I gone mental - surely it is only the sea salt on seaweed that makes it taste salty? So why would it ever be a way to reduce your salt intake?
13/04/2019, 22:31 - David;: 'Do you want to eat less salt in your diet? Why not try replacing salt with this thing that is also covered in salt'
13/04/2019, 22:34 - Paul;: Surely we‚Äôve gone mental and should just brine all foods we want to be salty in a cup of seawater over night rather than extracting salt from water
13/04/2019, 22:35 - Rob;: Canarian potatoes are boiled in sea water until all the liquid is gone and they're crusted with salt
13/04/2019, 22:36 - Rob;: And therefore fucking delicious
13/04/2019, 22:36 - Paul;: We‚Äôre doing salt wrong
13/04/2019, 22:37 - David;: Cut out the middle man - go straight to the seawater.
13/04/2019, 22:37 - Paul;: Water water everywhere
13/04/2019, 22:38 - Rob;: Sea water hard to come by in much of the country
13/04/2019, 22:38 - Rob;: Chipping Norton for example
13/04/2019, 22:38 - Rob;: Salt easier to transport
13/04/2019, 22:38 - David;: So we're wanting pure water and pure salt - but then we just combine them in meals anyway. Why not just drink seawater with meals. Can't see any problem with that.
13/04/2019, 22:39 - David;: But the salt's coming from the sea anyway Rob
13/04/2019, 22:39 - Paul;: And you get water for free
13/04/2019, 22:39 - David;: So you're transporting it to a plant to make salt and then transporting the salt
13/04/2019, 22:40 - Paul;: Train to watch train
13/04/2019, 22:40 - David;: Has anyone actually tried soaking everything in seawater or are we just going on the old wives tale that you can't drink it?
13/04/2019, 22:41 - Paul;: Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs been tested
13/04/2019, 22:41 - David;: A lot of outdated information holding us back
13/04/2019, 22:41 - Paul;: I eat salt I drink water ergo let me have sea water
13/04/2019, 22:42 - Rob;: Ok, you're right
13/04/2019, 22:42 - Rob;: I'll get sea water shipped and stop buying salt
13/04/2019, 22:42 - David;: Yeah - have both of them seperately all the time. Just save one step in the process
13/04/2019, 22:42 - Paul;: If we can pipe in fresh water with all difficult treatment; just pipe in sea water
13/04/2019, 22:43 - Paul;: Cost saving. Twice as useful
13/04/2019, 22:43 - Paul;: Add pepper as its piped in
13/04/2019, 22:43 - David;: The amount of truck hours and petrol that would be saved in delivering all the salt
13/04/2019, 22:43 - David;: Lol so seasoned water through all taps
13/04/2019, 22:44 - David;: pre-seasoned
13/04/2019, 22:44 - Paul;: Add generic spices
13/04/2019, 22:44 - Rob;: Exploring the world by ship would have gone so much better if they'd just ignored that stupid wives' tale and drunk the water
13/04/2019, 22:44 - Paul;: No one uses all the nutmeg or cinnamon
13/04/2019, 22:44 - David;: And a few potatoes and beef come in through the tap as well
13/04/2019, 22:44 - David;: In fact you end up with a nice salty roast dinner
13/04/2019, 22:45 - Paul;: >disrupt water
13/04/2019, 22:45 - Rob;: So stew on tap?
13/04/2019, 22:45 - David;: Yeah yeah
13/04/2019, 22:45 - Paul;: Broth on tap
13/04/2019, 22:45 - David;: Why do we even shop and cook? Just have a row of taps for all the main generic foods.
13/04/2019, 22:46 - David;: Cereal and milk tap; roast tap; fry up tap etc.
13/04/2019, 22:47 - Rob;: Sausage tap
13/04/2019, 22:47 - Paul;: Yolk tap
13/04/2019, 22:49 - Jack G;: Guys, I think we‚Äôre overthinking this

13/04/2019, 22:50 - Rob;: What if you went out and left a tap running?
13/04/2019, 22:51 - Rob;: Fucking raw sausages flooding the place
13/04/2019, 22:51 - Paul;: You pay the costs. Just like now useless water left running
13/04/2019, 22:51 - Jack G;: What‚Äôs fueling this endless supply of sausages?
13/04/2019, 22:52 - Paul;: üêñ

13/04/2019, 22:53 - David;: Lol
13/04/2019, 22:53 - David;: What's fuelling the endless supply of water now Jack? Doesn't grow on trees does it?
13/04/2019, 22:53 - Jack G;: Famously there is a water cycle
13/04/2019, 22:54 - Jack G;: Never heard of a pig cycle

13/04/2019, 22:54 - Paul;: That‚Äôs because science isn‚Äôt there yet
13/04/2019, 22:55 - Rob;: Pigs give birth to more pigs
13/04/2019, 22:56 - David;: Our frousty sweat evaporates to form grease clouds which eventually rain pigs back onto the land
13/04/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: A pig cycle
13/04/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: Feed sausages to pigs, like the Matrix
13/04/2019, 22:58 - David;: These pigs flow into the relevant pig rivers where they eventually pass into back treatment plants and back into our taps
13/04/2019, 22:58 - David;: *bacon

Shame I was rather hoping for a new layout to the Shangri-la section...
16/04/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: But how would you get back to your tent after a mad one in shangri-la if it‚Äôs moved?
16/04/2019, 18:30 - Rob;: I don't think that means it won't have different content
16/04/2019, 18:31 - Rob;: The apocalypse themed one had the same layout as the heaven and hell themed one, but they had different clubs and bars
16/04/2019, 18:35 - Rob;: It would be shit if it was the same again, agreed
16/04/2019, 19:02 - Phill: Camped at Pennard Hill before. Thoughts? Was quite nice. Near the froust areas.
16/04/2019, 19:06 - Rob;: Yeah I like it. It's the first to fill up as it's renowned as the party place, but worth a try
16/04/2019, 19:08 - Rob;: The last few years I have always ended up at the dairy grounds, which is just the other side of the Park from Pen Hill. It's fine, and great access to one of the carparks, but a bit far from Pyramid
16/04/2019, 19:10 - Phill: Basically, just want somewhere on the quieter side
16/04/2019, 19:10 - Rob;: I've also camped on the hill sort of opposite pyramid too, think it's called Michael's Mead. I think uni mates have a preference for there
16/04/2019, 19:10 - Rob;: Probs not penard hill them
16/04/2019, 19:11 - Phill: I remember it being alright last time.
16/04/2019, 19:11 - Phill: Was 21 and on Mandy most of the weekend so that could be it
16/04/2019, 19:12 - Rob;: I don't really care much as long as we have space, it's not an obvious flood plain and it's not 24 he rave central
16/04/2019, 19:12 - Rob;: It will probably just come down to who gets there first and where they first see a good spot
16/04/2019, 19:13 - Rob;: I have too many separate groups going to camp with them all probably. It's hard to know how to play it.
16/04/2019, 19:14 - Phill: Got to be with us Rob. Rob. Rob. Surely. Rob.
16/04/2019, 19:15 - Phill: Rob pls....
16/04/2019, 19:16 - Rob;: I think probably you guys with my sister too
16/04/2019, 19:16 - Rob;: But I bring a Steve with me, which would separate him from my uni group

16/04/2019, 19:27 - David;: Rexit
16/04/2019, 19:27 - Phill: We'll be there first. I challenge you.

16/04/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Cool. Will happily pay a pint to avoid the tent guarding
16/04/2019, 19:28 - Phill: Ok Israel.

17/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: How is your brain processing who to support with city v Spurs rob?
17/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: Spurs are obviously good and city evil
17/04/2019, 20:19 - Jack G;: That‚Äôs easy. Supporting City 100%. Fuck spurs being anywhere near a champions league final
17/04/2019, 20:19 - David;: Lol jack how do you even have Spurs beef?
17/04/2019, 20:20 - Phill: Lol jack fuck off.
17/04/2019, 20:20 - David;: City are obviously cunts
17/04/2019, 20:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah not sure I get this
17/04/2019, 20:20 - Phill: What are you an 11 year old boy who just got into footy?
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Jack G;: Spurs famously biggest ‚Äúrival‚Äù of West Ham in the premier league
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: But arnt arsenal spurs biggest rival?
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Phill: City famously biggest rival of football
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: So your biggest rival doesn't even recognise you
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Jack G;: Yeah but doesn‚Äôt mean we can‚Äôt hate them too
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Must be annoying not to be their number 1 rival
17/04/2019, 20:22 - Phill: Like Milwall with Chelsea
17/04/2019, 20:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Chamions league semi finals should be for teams who sell out their stadiums, as a basic rule
17/04/2019, 20:22 - David;: Lol
17/04/2019, 20:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Monaco and city cam fuck off
17/04/2019, 20:22 - David;: A one-directional huge rivalry
17/04/2019, 20:23 - Rob;: I'm essentially a neutral at this stage. I don't want either to win the Champions League, so just supporting goals.
17/04/2019, 20:23 - David;: If City win football loses
17/04/2019, 20:23 - Rob;: Ajax to win
17/04/2019, 20:23 - Jack G;: But at least they have no fans to be cunts about winning
17/04/2019, 20:23 - David;: Yeah Ajax win would be great, but you have to call this match
17/04/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: Perhaps Spurs to win just on the offchance it might make City more likely to beat them at the weekend?
17/04/2019, 20:24 - Phill: No.
17/04/2019, 20:24 - Phill: Need league.
17/04/2019, 20:25 - David;: This fucking argument. 'Id rather a fake club can buy their way to success by being sponsored by an oil dictatorship because there will be no actual fans to care about it'
17/04/2019, 20:25 - David;: Great. Brilliant spectacle
17/04/2019, 20:26 - David;: So essentially take rivalries and passion out of football.
17/04/2019, 20:26 - Rob;: Also Jack, don't you live exactly where _all_ the City fans are

17/04/2019, 21:57 - David;: This is great
17/04/2019, 21:57 - David;: Yeah, so much worse than just not scoring
17/04/2019, 21:57 - Phill: Fuck off jack fuck off jack fuck off jack
17/04/2019, 21:58 - Paul;: Lol jack
17/04/2019, 21:58 - Jack G;: Why do you care so much that I don‚Äôt like spurs?
17/04/2019, 21:59 - Phill: Its not that you don't like spurs, it's that you'd rather city win is what baffles.
17/04/2019, 21:59 - Phill: I don't like Everton. I don't like Chelsea. I don't like United. But I hate city more than them all combined.
17/04/2019, 21:59 - Paul;: Plastic jack
17/04/2019, 22:00 - Jack G;: Absolute bull shit
17/04/2019, 22:00 - Phill: Lol
17/04/2019, 22:00 - David;: If you want city to win over any given real club you're not a real fan
17/04/2019, 22:01 - Jack G;: I never said that. I‚Äôd literally support anyone other than spurs or PSG against city
17/04/2019, 22:01 - Phill: But PSG and City are the same thing
17/04/2019, 22:02 - Jack G;: Equally bad but city get the tie breaker courtesy of being an English team
17/04/2019, 22:02 - David;: Psg acceptable because it cancels out. Juve as well.
17/04/2019, 22:02 - David;: But spurs
17/04/2019, 22:02 - Paul;: Didn‚Äôt even know west ham and spurs was a rivalry
17/04/2019, 22:03 - Jack G;: It is for West Ham. Not so much for spurs
17/04/2019, 22:03 - David;: Lots of English players, don't spend stupid money etc.
17/04/2019, 22:04 - Rob;: Every team in London hates Spurs
17/04/2019, 22:04 - Phill: Because they're the biggest club?
17/04/2019, 22:04 - Rob;: Chelsea Spurs is probably the worst in terms of fan violence
17/04/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: No it's long standing throughout their dismal history
17/04/2019, 22:05 - Paul;: It‚Äôs like your other huge rivalry with Juventus they‚Äôre not aware of
17/04/2019, 22:05 - Paul;: And no one else is
17/04/2019, 22:08 - David;: I get that an arsenal fan doesn't like spurs but when they're playing City. It's like the way we were okay with the Soviet Union when they were fighting Hitler. You just let that lie for a while.
17/04/2019, 22:11 - Jack G;: City more likely to beat spurs in the league match now. Unlucky
17/04/2019, 22:12 - David;: Sassy
17/04/2019, 22:13 - Phill: History not an indicator of future performance Jack. You, of all people, as a west ham fan, should know this.
17/04/2019, 22:56 - Hamish Sinclair: To reopen our discussion  from a few months ago regarding the fa/league cup...

Would city winning fame cup and league cup only be considered a success?
17/04/2019, 22:59 - Rob;: City hierachy would probably be a little disappointed, but only in the context that they've spent the money for more.
17/04/2019, 22:59 - Rob;: It's not not a success
17/04/2019, 23:00 - David;: Yeah you can't say they've had a bad season
17/04/2019, 23:00 - Rob;: And it would just continue their feeling of dominance
17/04/2019, 23:01 - Rob;: No one really remembers when United's lesser seasons were, just that they were the dominant side for most of the 90s and early 2000s

23/04/2019, 17:36 - David;: A timeless classic
23/04/2019, 18:43 - David;: Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler says his lack of managerial experience "doesn't matter" after being appointed as the new boss of Brisbane Roar.

His only previous managerial experience came during a short spell with Thai side Muangthong United in 2011-12.

"Just because I'm not as experienced as some of them, doesn't mean I'm going to do as bad a job," he said.

"You could have Jurgen Klopp here, you could have Pep Guardiola, it doesn't necessarily mean they are going to be great managing Brisbane."

24/04/2019, 09:36 - Hamish Sinclair: I've already been supporting them in the chamions league so not a big deal
24/04/2019, 13:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Dont look like they're capable of much at the moment though, hanging my Hope's on burnley
24/04/2019, 14:44 - David;: Yeah fine, always support them in Europe and against fake teams.
24/04/2019, 16:26 - Paul;: If only Sam could do the honourable thing
24/04/2019, 17:05 - Jack G;: All the United fans I‚Äôve spoken to want them to lose tonight. Will be a weird atmosphere at old toilet
24/04/2019, 17:07 - David;: Lol such a small club mentality. When 4th is on the line. Says a lot about how far they've fallen
24/04/2019, 17:08 - David;: It's fine we'll just have to hope for a real club like Burnley or Leiscester to play them who have some self-respect
24/04/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: You can't ever want your team to lose, no matter what the outcome is
24/04/2019, 17:13 - Jack G;: Yeah it‚Äôs mental
24/04/2019, 17:13 - Rob;: Arsenal to score a late winner to trigger a nuclear winter? Yes please

24/04/2019, 20:38 - Rob;: Yeah that's pretty full strength out of who's available
24/04/2019, 20:38 - Jack G;: Got to be all in on Europa surely now
24/04/2019, 20:38 - David;: Kolasinac, aubameyang

26/04/2019, 10:25 - David;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Best
26/04/2019, 10:25 - David;: Just looking into George Best - that post-United career. Really got away from him.
26/04/2019, 10:32 - David;: Heads straight for the Jewish Guild. Age 27. Makes 5 appearences. Then who should come knocking but Dunstable Town on a loan deal.
26/04/2019, 12:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Made 5 appearances for Bournemouth at the age of 37
26/04/2019, 12:03 - Rob;: 4 clubs in 1983
26/04/2019, 12:04 - David;: Yeah, with a total of 13 appearances between them
26/04/2019, 12:04 - David;: Had a little late rennaisance at San Jose earthquakes though. Pops in 21 goals in the 80-81 season
26/04/2019, 12:15 - Rob;: I wish they'd recorded a pints to goals ratio
26/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: Surely boozy centre backs would just dominate though
26/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: Your Tony Adams
26/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: His ratio would be obscene
26/04/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: I think pints would be considered like games, so a striker might have a 1 in 2 ratio - one goal for every two pints
26/04/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Tony Ten Pints' ratio would be correspondingly poor
26/04/2019, 13:47 - Damian Rumble: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6954283/Change-UK-group-plots-destroy-Lib-Dems.html
26/04/2019, 13:49 - Damian Rumble: I was cautiously optimistic about the TIG party but not anymore. They all resigned to fight Brexit but instead they have made it thier priority to fight the other anti Brexit party despite our offer to work together. I hope they all get spanked at the next general election...
26/04/2019, 13:49 - David;: I guess. But then light drinkers would clean up. You really need a pint-adjusted goals/game index. So for every 100 pints consumed, your goals are adjusted up by a weighting.
26/04/2019, 13:50 - David;: So e.g. Gazza's career comes out better than Pele's because of the pints he got in while doing it.
26/04/2019, 13:52 - Stefan;: Yeah and they've put up a slate of hilariously dreadful candidates, one whom has been endorsed by UKIP's leader
26/04/2019, 13:52 - Stefan;: Turns out you can be a remainer and still be a fucking racist
26/04/2019, 13:54 - David;: Yeah fucking hate TIG. Self-important pricks - there are already 2 committed remain UK parties (Green and Lib Dem) plus SNP and Plaid if that's your voting preference. They have just splintered it further and made Brexit party more likely to clean up.
26/04/2019, 13:55 - David;: Plus they are vacuous third way tossers
26/04/2019, 14:00 - David;: Wasnt there a thing with Adams where he stopped drinking and his form collapsed? Or stops being influential in the dressing room. So boozing actually key to his success.
26/04/2019, 14:05 - Damian Rumble: It's just so fucking petty. The main selling point is 'politics is broken, we are going to be a party of change' but they've essentially copied the policies of the other parties in this area and immediately descended into tribalism.
26/04/2019, 14:53 - Rob;: Adams did say the best game of his life was while pissed I tbink
26/04/2019, 14:54 - Rob;: Possibly Euro 96 semi
26/04/2019, 14:59 - Jack G;: Imagine trying to mark someone called Kuntz while smashed
26/04/2019, 15:08 - Rob;: It could have been the intervening jail sentence. I'm sure I was overly aware of it all at the time

28/04/2019, 12:34 - David;: Arsenal look a bit shit suddenly
28/04/2019, 13:37 - Phill: Suddenly?

28/04/2019, 13:39 - David;: Then the old 5 losses in 6 premier league games.
28/04/2019, 13:39 - David;: (If they lose this game)

30/04/2019, 14:19 - David;: Fucking pick one
30/04/2019, 14:19 - Jack G;: Change UK, advocating for the status quo
30/04/2019, 14:20 - David;: No time for them.
30/04/2019, 14:30 - Damian Rumble: I've gone full circle on chukka. When labour were in power I thought he was smug and stuck up prick. Under miliband I thought he was a whiny prick. Under Corbyn he actually came across as a fairly reasonable prick. Now in change UK he's reverted to a smug and stuck up prick.
30/04/2019, 14:31 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs all very petty
30/04/2019, 14:43 - Rob;: They've managed to completely conform to the sitting on the fence stereotype that dogs centrist politics with with a logo that looks like a fence and a name that's a compromise between two options
30/04/2019, 14:44 - David;: Both of which are themselves bland and non-commital
30/04/2019, 14:45 - David;: It looks like they've redacted half of their own name as well.
30/04/2019, 15:02 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
30/04/2019, 17:11 - Damian Rumble: Back to game of thrones briefly. My many years of playing Rome total war has me raising serious eye brows at Jon snow's battle plan. I mean you have a massive castle... So let's put our artillery outside of it in our front line so they can literally only get one shot away before getting over run. Such noobs...
30/04/2019, 17:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Also why send the cavalry off I  advance
30/04/2019, 17:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Makes no sense whatsoever, they run off completely unsupported
30/04/2019, 17:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Amateurs
30/04/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: Poor use of dragons
30/04/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: Let the shit munchers come to you and roast them from the air, rather than looking for one guy who's going to turn up anyway
30/04/2019, 17:24 - Stefan;: Not great tactics from the night king either though
30/04/2019, 17:25 - Stefan;: Didn't get his bodyguards to check for little girls hiding in the bushes
30/04/2019, 17:25 - Stefan;: Or just you know, stand near him in case someone had a go
30/04/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: The other white walker could surely have done some work at some point
30/04/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: I feel quite disappointed to have been sold this big fantasy element, shrouded in mystery, then see it killed off without learning anything about it
30/04/2019, 17:27 - Sam;: We know how the white king was created
30/04/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: But then no more scraps of info else since. Makes Bran's role, beyond bait, seem quite small, when it earlier seemed very important
30/04/2019, 17:29 - Sam;: I want to see what the lord of light is about. Was he just wanting to help kill night king or more?
30/04/2019, 17:30 - Stefan;: There's a lot of fans who are butthurt about something called the prophecy of Azor Ahai, which has apparently been ruined now
30/04/2019, 17:33 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm hoping that GRRM is also cheesed off at everything and he‚Äôll be motivated to actually finish the books now
30/04/2019, 17:35 - David;: Yeah Bran's whole story arc now pointless
30/04/2019, 17:36 - David;: It was a real dry hump of a resolution
30/04/2019, 17:36 - Rob;: It was a good episode and very well made, but the storyline pay-offs were pretty low
30/04/2019, 17:37 - Rob;: Although I am glad all those fucking years of watching Arya scrub the fucking floor as an assassin's apprentice paid off
30/04/2019, 17:37 - David;: It just felt arbitrary - no attempt to link it into all of the lore they have built up over 100s of hours of my life
30/04/2019, 17:38 - David;: Jon snow pointless. Dragons pointless.
30/04/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: Perhaps we will see in flashback what Bran was doing, beyond flapping about as a raven, while the war waged
30/04/2019, 17:39 - Jack G;: The writing/directing definitely has a marked drop in quality since they‚Äôve gone beyond the material of the existing books.
30/04/2019, 17:40 - David;: How did Arya even know where he was? And how did she fight out of a castle over-run with 1000s of reanimated corpses in a few minutes?
30/04/2019, 17:41 - David;: On her own
30/04/2019, 17:42 - Rob;: She knew he was going for Bran and where Bran was. I got the impression that she had jumped from a rooftop nearby the room we last saw her in
30/04/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: Hence why the red woman was in there
30/04/2019, 17:43 - David;: But everyone else knew he was there
30/04/2019, 17:43 - David;: No reason to try and go there? Only she thought of it
30/04/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: The red woman told her to
30/04/2019, 17:44 - David;: Was he that close to the castle that you can just jump there from the roof?!
30/04/2019, 17:44 - David;: Definitely never established that and if so everyone would see that ages ago
30/04/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: She must have jumped from a height to get that height
30/04/2019, 17:45 - David;: So he was just hanging out at the base of the castle - no one from either side realised?
30/04/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: Yeah, that was the plan they agreed in the last episode. Use bran as bait out in the open in the small wood next to the castle
30/04/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: Lure the night king
30/04/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: He was craters for bran
30/04/2019, 17:52 - Stefan;: This is how they filmed it https://twitter.com/YahTimest/status/1123100417754324992?s=08
30/04/2019, 17:57 - David;: Also  for the battlb7e?
30/04/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: What does Bran do now? He's a freak with only one purpose in the world and it's been achieved
30/04/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: He's immediately post referendum Farage
30/04/2019, 17:58 - Rob;: Perhaps Remainers will bring the white walkers back
30/04/2019, 18:01 - David;: So that was the whole basis of the battle plan. But relies on the red lady whispering it to Arya Stark on the off chance?
30/04/2019, 18:01 - David;: Great fucking communication strategy
30/04/2019, 18:01 - David;: And no one else was told where he would be
30/04/2019, 18:08 - Sam;: Everyone was told where he would be in the planning meeting.
30/04/2019, 18:08 - Sam;: Arya was there
30/04/2019, 18:09 - Sam;: End of last episode
30/04/2019, 18:09 - Sam;: Eppy 2
30/04/2019, 18:10 - David;: But none of the key players were making any attempt to get there. Jon faffing about in the castle
30/04/2019, 18:10 - David;: Lannister et al otherwise engaged
30/04/2019, 18:11 - Sam;: Jon was pinned down by the dragon, other players pinned down by undead soldiers.
30/04/2019, 19:17 - Paul;: Is the fat one dead yet?
30/04/2019, 19:18 - David;: Nah survived
30/04/2019, 19:42 - / James Ball: Never watched
30/04/2019, 19:50 - David;: Anyone seen this asmr thing?
30/04/2019, 19:51 - / James Ball: Multiple thousands of videos of it
30/04/2019, 19:51 - / James Ball: Well, that exist. I havent watched multiple thousands
30/04/2019, 19:52 - David;: Yeah it's huge
30/04/2019, 19:53 - Rob;: I Googled and an article suggested I might orgasm to the noise of a man eating KFC
30/04/2019, 19:53 - Rob;: Is that what you meant?
30/04/2019, 19:53 - Hamish Sinclair: No thankyou
30/04/2019, 19:53 - David;: Haven't seen that particular video
30/04/2019, 19:54 - Damian Rumble: There's another three episodes right? Not sure they are how they are going to fill them. Surely Dany goes kings landing but then realised she only has an army of 12 major characters who were somehow able to survive people the battle. Gets fucked by cersi. Game over.
30/04/2019, 19:55 - / James Ball: I watched a couple of some Scottish girl doing it
30/04/2019, 19:55 - / James Ball: I get the idea of it
30/04/2019, 19:55 - / James Ball: But no orgasms - yet
30/04/2019, 19:56 - David;: Nah it's more spine tingles Sort of works. There was one guy doing some very intense ones
30/04/2019, 19:57 - / James Ball: Yeah it's taps into some kind of deep rooted catatonic thing I think
30/04/2019, 19:57 - / James Ball: Like massaging a chicken to make it all asleep
30/04/2019, 19:58 - David;: https://youtu.be/Ch_i9jxLhXs
30/04/2019, 19:58 - David;: Where he uses the toothbrush direct on the mic
30/04/2019, 19:58 - David;: Very close
30/04/2019, 20:02 - Paul;: Lol such bullshit
30/04/2019, 20:03 - David;: But the buzz mate
30/04/2019, 20:04 - / James Ball: I've never got a chill from it but it does have an effect if you're in the mood to allow it
30/04/2019, 20:04 - Sam;: Like a decent blozza
30/04/2019, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: https://twitter.com/JOE_co_uk/status/1122945238727786498?s=08
30/04/2019, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: This really tickled me
30/04/2019, 21:06 - David;: Lol
30/04/2019, 21:06 - David;: Winterfell United held firm under immense pressure for what felt like the full 90 minutes before Stark struck late to put them through to the final, where they will face Cersei Lannister's dangerous King's Landing side.
30/04/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: That really is excellent
30/04/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: There is nothing that can't be viewed through the prism of football
30/04/2019, 21:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Unused subsitute: Tyrion lanister
30/04/2019, 21:28 - David;: Called up due to an injury crisis, the academy prospect appeared to be hopelessly out of her depth but did well to halt a midfield surge from zombie Wun Wun just when he looked like he might break through the Winterfell backline. Regardless, it was a poor decision from the manager to rush her into the starting lineup as she struggled to cope with the immense physicality of the league
01/05/2019, 08:02 - Damian Rumble: Zombie Wun Wun - 

Put in some heavy challenges and looked set to be the man to break the deadlock before losing an embarrassing 50/50 to the much smaller Lyanna Mormont that, just like Paul Pogba's dismal aerial duel with Raheem Sterling during last week's Manchester Derby, has since been ridiculed by the tabloids, who are now also attacking his body language and most recent haircuts.
01/05/2019, 08:02 - Damian Rumble: Great
01/05/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/05/2019, 17:54 - Jack G;: Odds on Suarez to bite Van Dijk tonight?
01/05/2019, 20:12 - Sam;: Luis Suarez is so hateable
01/05/2019, 20:12 - Sam;: Just seeing him on a pitch
01/05/2019, 20:12 - David;: Good to be able to hate him now
01/05/2019, 20:13 - Sam;: His ratty little bite face
01/05/2019, 20:14 - David;: Yeah, it's one thing to bite. But to gnaw down like a rodent
01/05/2019, 20:15 - David;: And then pretend the real injustice is that his arm has hurt your teeth
01/05/2019, 20:16 - Sam;: And top of that,be a terrible cunt. Irredeemable. Only Uruguayans could like him
01/05/2019, 20:17 - David;: Massive penno earlier, why didn't ref even go to VAR?
01/05/2019, 20:17 - David;: Pointless
01/05/2019, 20:18 - Sam;: Not enough really. Ridiculous first 15 though. Breathless.
01/05/2019, 20:18 - Sam;: Can‚Äôt keep it up for 90 surely
01/05/2019, 20:18 - David;: Anywhere else on the pitch of you go through someone from behind it's a free kick
01/05/2019, 20:19 - Sam;: Yeah, age old thing though, has to be more to be a pen
01/05/2019, 20:19 - Sam;: Classic example there
01/05/2019, 20:19 - Sam;: Mane getting the free kick
01/05/2019, 20:20 - Sam;: Wouldn‚Äôt have got a pen for that
01/05/2019, 20:22 - David;: But why have VAR if you don't even check it?
01/05/2019, 20:22 - David;: It just makes it arbitrary
01/05/2019, 20:25 - Sam;: The theory is that VAR is for clear cut issues or errors, not for everything
01/05/2019, 20:28 - Sam;: One away goal is all that‚Äôs needed
01/05/2019, 20:40 - Sam;: What happened to keita? I missed that
01/05/2019, 20:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Groin
01/05/2019, 20:41 - Phill: Was fucking Barca too hard in the butthole and he bust his dick
01/05/2019, 20:41 - Sam;: His grogodoins?
01/05/2019, 21:37 - Sam;: Again. One away goal changes everything
01/05/2019, 21:38 - Phill: So lucky
01/05/2019, 21:44 - David;: Hate the way everyone will rave about Messi now. Pure luck for that goal and has been quiet all game. But will be all about him.
01/05/2019, 21:44 - Jack G;: Wtf
01/05/2019, 21:44 - David;: Ah. Well
01/05/2019, 21:44 - David;: Lol
01/05/2019, 21:44 - Jack G;: Nice timing
01/05/2019, 21:45 - David;: Phil bet
01/05/2019, 21:46 - Jack G;: How did Salah miss that?
01/05/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Yet still . Salad fucks its
01/05/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Wotsits
01/05/2019, 21:47 - Damian Rumble: Lol
01/05/2019, 21:48 - Jack G;: Suarez such a cunt
01/05/2019, 21:49 - David;: Put away the moon
01/05/2019, 21:50 - Damian Rumble: Messi. Accidentally puts it in when the ball bounces back in his face. Salah. can't put it in when shooting at an empty goal.
01/05/2019, 21:50 - Jack G;: Apples and oranges
01/05/2019, 21:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Very fine margins
01/05/2019, 22:08 - Damian Rumble: Anyone else planning on supporting Ajax against Barcelona in the final?
01/05/2019, 22:08 - Hamish Sinclair: >not supporting the underdogs

02/05/2019, 09:37 - David;: The kangaroo lawyers must be furious. Only thing their legal system is know for is corruption
02/05/2019, 09:38 - David;: Sure there are p
02/05/2019, 09:38 - Stefan;: Yeah it's an outrageous smear on them

03/05/2019, 08:25 - Damian Rumble: Secondary question.. what is walking football???
03/05/2019, 08:26 - Rob;: Old man football, more or less how it sounds
03/05/2019, 08:27 - Hamish Sinclair: It's what we will all be doing in 40 years
03/05/2019, 08:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Walking frisbee
03/05/2019, 09:01 - Paul;: Essentially he‚Äôs won the FA cup
03/05/2019, 09:02 - David;: You'd take that
03/05/2019, 09:03 - David;: Does this qualify him for European glory next season?
03/05/2019, 09:04 - Paul;: European glory being versus Gloucestershire or something
03/05/2019, 09:05 - David;: Yeah are there any higher level tournies he can get into?
03/05/2019, 09:13 - Rob;: What position does Derek play?
03/05/2019, 09:19 - Damian Rumble: I feel like he's got the build of a centre back
03/05/2019, 09:19 - Paul;: I believe everyone ambles everywhere. They‚Äôve brought back total football
03/05/2019, 09:19 - Paul;: 80‚Äôs Dutch playing style
03/05/2019, 09:20 - Damian Rumble: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2787824/

Basically this...
03/05/2019, 09:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Virgil van derek
03/05/2019, 09:34 - Paul;: Tricky van dicky
03/05/2019, 14:01 - David;: Will Emery rotate everyone on Sunday Rob?
03/05/2019, 14:02 - David;: Will the players in the first XI even have legs?
03/05/2019, 14:14 - Rob;: Probably. I wouldn't be investing
03/05/2019, 16:43 - David;: <Media omitted>
03/05/2019, 16:46 - / James Ball: good stats
03/05/2019, 16:46 - / James Ball: a mate of mine was just elected as a green councillor for south oxfordshire - he's not called Alan Graves so the stat checks out so far
03/05/2019, 16:50 - Stefan;: Greens won 5 seats in South Oxfordshire and 12 in Mid Suffolk - biggest opposition party there now
03/05/2019, 16:51 - / James Ball: yes indeed, he's very happy and a little overwhelmed
03/05/2019, 16:52 - / James Ball: my ward is labour and two independents now
03/05/2019, 17:34 - Damian Rumble: That will soon disappear when the reality of surrendering all for evening and weekends to petty arguments about bins and the glacial progress of decision making really kicks in
03/05/2019, 17:38 - / James Ball: he's 42, been involved in local politics for several years
03/05/2019, 17:39 - / James Ball: for someone advocating democratic process you're also very damning of it Damo

03/05/2019, 17:46 - Jack G;: Really happy to see the greens do so well though
03/05/2019, 17:48 - Paul;: All independents got fucked in chippy. Were the best ones. The sheeple all just voted labour
03/05/2019, 17:56 - David;: What did the independents want?
03/05/2019, 17:57 - Paul;: You‚Äôve got your Dom Harrison‚Äôs. a chippy favourite. Just appreciates the place been here for generations
03/05/2019, 17:57 - Paul;: Sambo knows him
03/05/2019, 17:58 - Rob;: Dom who used to work in the Blue?
03/05/2019, 18:00 - Paul;: Nah don‚Äôt think so
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Rob;: Shame. I'd have voted for Dom's policy of filling up a shelf with pints just before last orders and distributing them after

03/05/2019, 18:03 - Rob;: Yeah that's him
03/05/2019, 18:07 - Paul;: Lost out by 50 votes. Corruption to the heart of small government
03/05/2019, 18:09 - Stefan;: Lol, that's definitely illegal. Remember learning in the parliamentary reform unit about how 18th century elections were drunken riots where candidates handed out free booze for votes
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: It wasn't for votes then
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: We paid for the pints
03/05/2019, 18:15 - Stefan;: Fair enough
03/05/2019, 18:15 - Stefan;: He missed an opportunity though

04/05/2019, 13:36 - Rob;: Spurs gonna Spurs
04/05/2019, 13:37 - Rob;: 3 mins on the pitch for Forth then
04/05/2019, 13:37 - Sam;: They made two half time subs to take off two players on a booking. Then one of the subs gets a straight red
04/05/2019, 13:37 - Rob;: Brought on to avoid a second booking
04/05/2019, 14:20 - Jack G;: Finally
05/05/2019, 12:06 - David;: So it's essentially still Saturday
05/05/2019, 13:40 - David;: Derek must be loving that West Brom goal Paul?

05/05/2019, 16:21 - Sam;: We‚Äôre in the position PEADOPOOL we‚Äôre in when sloppy kloppy took over and when poch took over at spurs.
05/05/2019, 16:21 - Sam;: Wenger out
05/05/2019, 16:24 - Phill: >sloppy kloppy
05/05/2019, 16:25 - David;: Will Pogba stick around without the champo
05/05/2019, 16:26 - Sam;: All bets are off

05/05/2019, 16:31 - Sam;: Anyone young but not Young
05/05/2019, 16:33 - Phill: Even De Gea is affected by the United shitening factor
05/05/2019, 16:35 - David;: Jones and Smalling. Get rid
05/05/2019, 16:35 - David;: Can't build a team around gurns
05/05/2019, 16:35 - Paul;: Is there even a star player
05/05/2019, 16:36 - Paul;: A talisman
05/05/2019, 16:36 - David;: Such a specific skill with no evident football relevance
05/05/2019, 16:41 - Phill: It means United have now gone five games without a win, their worst sequence since they went eight games without a victory under Louis van Gaal between November and December 2015.
05/05/2019, 16:42 - Phill: Lol. Pure shite.
05/05/2019, 22:59 - David;: Chelsea's next kit is quite rank
06/05/2019, 07:58 - Phill: If arsenal and Chelsea get yuropa final and Chelsea win, do arsenal get the CL spot?
06/05/2019, 08:14 - Jack G;: Nope only get it if they win the trophy
06/05/2019, 08:14 - Phill: Who get the spare spot?
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Phill: Some Eastern European team who finished 3rd in the Chechnyan league or something ?
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Jack G;: Probably an extra team in qualifying rounds somewhere
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Jack G;: Most probably
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Phill: Harsh.
06/05/2019, 08:18 - Jack G;: Adds extra spice to the final though

07/05/2019, 21:33 - Rob;: Only worth ¬£2.87 million in gold

08/05/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: Overlooking the fact that their success overturned a seemingly decisive first result
08/05/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: And that ultimately it's kept them _in_ Europe
08/05/2019, 20:03 - Jack G;: Can‚Äôt believe Vertonghen is playing so soon after that pretty bad concussion injury last week
08/05/2019, 20:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, the rule is 1 week
08/05/2019, 20:06 - Jack G;: Really dangerous risking another blow to the head so soon, I‚Äôd want to take more time to recover for sure
08/05/2019, 20:26 - David;: Seems very cautious - aren't you basically over concussion in a couple of days?
08/05/2019, 20:29 - Phill: Said every coach ever until players started becoming disabled.
08/05/2019, 20:31 - Jack G;: Especially for a CB who‚Äôs going to be heading the ball all night
08/05/2019, 20:31 - David;: That's like rugby forwards etc. Bit of light concussion now and then probably fine.
08/05/2019, 20:32 - Phill: Little bit of stroke. Fine mate.
08/05/2019, 20:33 - Phill: Spurs are dog shit
08/05/2019, 20:34 - Jack G;: Taught at the school of large Samuel
08/05/2019, 20:36 - David;: A bonce in hand is worth two on the bench
08/05/2019, 20:37 - David;: Dr Sinclair what actually is concussion?
08/05/2019, 20:40 - David;: >Trippier. Play to the whistle.
08/05/2019, 20:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Mild head trauma
08/05/2019, 20:43 - David;: Bit is it a nervous thing or blood?
08/05/2019, 20:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Diagnosis is normally based on quite vague/subtle cognitive changes though
08/05/2019, 20:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Predomiently nervous
08/05/2019, 20:44 - Hamish Sinclair: But sometimes you can see some minor bleeding/bruising on imageing
08/05/2019, 20:44 - David;: Ah. Bleeding in the brain
08/05/2019, 20:44 - Hamish Sinclair: But unlike something like a stroke, it affects the brain globally rather than a specific area
08/05/2019, 20:45 - David;: When they were wheeling out the Karius diagnosis like 3 weeks later would that have been based on imaging?
08/05/2019, 20:45 - Hamish Sinclair: No
08/05/2019, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Cognitive assesment
08/05/2019, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Its so vague though, and quite subjective
08/05/2019, 20:46 - David;: Especially retrospectively - so was he recalling how he felt?
08/05/2019, 20:46 - Phill: When did BOOOOZAN Tadic become good?
08/05/2019, 20:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Things like, loss of concentration, low mood score, and both of those things could be associated with fucking up a European cup final
08/05/2019, 20:48 - Phill: Lol low mood
08/05/2019, 20:48 - Phill: Playing in a CL final. In a bad mood about it.
08/05/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, alot of the symptoms of concussion  would be similar to those shown after a career ending performance
08/05/2019, 20:49 - Phill: "it was revealed by Klopps backroom medical team that Karius suffered a bout of low mood during the game"
08/05/2019, 20:49 - David;: 'did you feel shit when you threw that ball straight onto the defenders foot and it bounced into the net in a CL final letting down all your teams mates'? Must be concussed
08/05/2019, 20:50 - David;: Lol
08/05/2019, 20:50 - David;: Apparently he's rebuilding at Besiktas
08/05/2019, 20:51 - David;: There's YouTube highlights clips to prove it
08/05/2019, 20:51 - Hamish Sinclair: I thought he was still shit?
08/05/2019, 20:51 - Phill: Think in the Turkish league you can be shit and get away with it
08/05/2019, 20:53 - Jack G;: You can make any keeper look like Neuer in a highlights video
08/05/2019, 20:57 - Paul;: Shittenham

08/05/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Lol Ajax have had it in their hands.
08/05/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Hands full of slurry.
08/05/2019, 21:49 - Jack G;: Vertonghen too concussed to score that open goal there
08/05/2019, 21:57 - David;: Fuck off
08/05/2019, 21:57 - David;: Football is over
08/05/2019, 21:58 - Jack G;: Fuck sake

08/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: What score?
08/05/2019, 22:00 - David;: Football is over Rob
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Phill: 3-2 spurs
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Phill: Moura hattrick
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: Nah
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Phill: Last kick of game
08/05/2019, 22:00 - David;: 95 minutes
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Phill: Spurs 2-0 down at half time
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Phill: 3-0 on aggregate
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Jack G;: Anyone got a spare Liverpool shirt I can wear for the final?
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Paul;: Here comes the troll to defeat Liverpool
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Damian Rumble: Lol
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Rob;: So the final is like a choice of which parent you have to fuck?
08/05/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: Do not want
08/05/2019, 22:02 - Jack G;: Is Salah back for the final?
08/05/2019, 22:02 - Phill: Yeah yeah
08/05/2019, 22:03 - Jack G;: Sweet
08/05/2019, 22:03 - Paul;: Means Liverpool win was shit. This better comeback
08/05/2019, 22:03 - David;: Firmino doubtful
08/05/2019, 22:03 - Jack G;: Origi is god anyway doesn‚Äôt matter
08/05/2019, 22:04 - Rob;: I never signed up4 this
08/05/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: Not in my name
08/05/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: I guess I am supporting Liverpool then.
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Phill: I'd 8-2 be an arsenal fan in this situation.
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Paul;: Lol rob how is the butthurt? Is this new levels of hurt?
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Jack G;: So chances are all 4 European finalist will be English this year?
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Paul;: Do you blame Gibbs now?
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Damian Rumble: What are the odds pre semi's?
08/05/2019, 22:07 - David;: There a lot if troll potential
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Phill: üëç
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Jack G;: The only real choice
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Rob;: I think I'll just come around to wanting Liverpool to win
08/05/2019, 22:08 - Rob;: For thehe greater good
08/05/2019, 22:08 - Phill: Might support spurs just for the trolling of arsenal. We've got 5.
08/05/2019, 22:08 - Jack G;: How about Ox smashes in a winner Rob?
08/05/2019, 22:10 - Rob;: Ah you'd be happy for the boy
08/05/2019, 22:11 - David;: Like everyone avoiding the elephant in the room that the 3rd goal clearly came off de ligt
08/05/2019, 22:11 - David;: Best no one ever mentions that
08/05/2019, 22:14 - Damian Rumble: 1st June going to be HUGE
08/05/2019, 22:22 - Paul;: Statue for Moura
08/05/2019, 22:24 - Damian Rumble: Soo... Man city wining the league. Liverpool spurs in the champion league final. Chelsea and arsenal potentially in the Europa League final. This means it is only United that have massively under achieved this year then...
08/05/2019, 22:28 - David;: Statue for Divock
08/05/2019, 22:28 - David;: The BT advert is so grindingly oppressive
08/05/2019, 22:29 - David;: A sense of impending doom and my mind juddering to a halt
08/05/2019, 22:29 - David;: *advert music
08/05/2019, 22:29 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
08/05/2019, 22:29 - Paul;: How much does this aggravate
08/05/2019, 22:39 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
08/05/2019, 22:41 - Paul;: I‚Äôm doing a spursy
08/05/2019, 22:42 - David;: üëç
08/05/2019, 22:51 - Damian Rumble: You know I'm very tempted to become a spurs fan. A side from the huge potential for trolling I do actually live in North London and there's huge milage as far as smugness is concerned when it comes to wining the champions League over Liverpool.
08/05/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: You live opposite the Emirates, Damo
08/05/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: A glory supporting spurs fan lol
08/05/2019, 22:57 - Paul;: Lol damo
08/05/2019, 22:57 - David;: >a side from huge potential
08/05/2019, 22:58 - David;: 7
08/05/2019, 23:03 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/05/2019, 23:04 - Stefan;: Nice, where's that?
08/05/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: Alley Pally
08/05/2019, 23:05 - Rob;: He's invested heavily in lighting since we saw him in Bristol
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Rob;: *Brixton
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Damian Rumble: Yeah that would have made a huge difference
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Damian Rumble: Can't believe I missed that show... Didn't even realise he was playing....
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Stefan;: That looks amazing
08/05/2019, 23:08 - Rob;: There are 3 nights in a row I think, might not be sold out
08/05/2019, 23:08 - David;: Needs a good sound system. Saw him at field day and didn't do it justice
08/05/2019, 23:09 - Rob;: This was pretty good, especially for Alexandra Palace
08/05/2019, 23:09 - David;: Yeah bonobo there was decent
08/05/2019, 23:09 - Rob;: I feel like he suffers from his only 'I'm only a DJ' insecurities. Could be fucking massive if he played his own stuff plus his remixes and made a show out of it
08/05/2019, 23:11 - David;: Isn't that basically what he does?
08/05/2019, 23:11 - David;: Planet there
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: But every time I've seen him he's just hidden away somewhere, and until now without a light show
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: Tonight was his album mixed with some new stuff
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: But none of the remix bangers
08/05/2019, 23:11 - David;: Oh yeah I see. Yeah was a bit like that at field day
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: No Eric Prydz, no Jamie Xx
08/05/2019, 23:13 - David;: I think it's a problem for people who get huge completely off the back of sample manipulation and production. How do you make that a live spectacle
08/05/2019, 23:13 - Rob;: Yeah
08/05/2019, 23:14 - Rob;: It's a legit way to make new sounds, but a bit of a cop out to press play and expect people to go wild
08/05/2019, 23:14 - Rob;: Chemical Brothers do it very well
08/05/2019, 23:14 - Rob;: If you build a good light show and danceable tunes, they will come
08/05/2019, 23:15 - David;: Caribou live is good
08/05/2019, 23:15 - Rob;: And Mr Norman Slim
08/05/2019, 23:16 - Rob;: Caribou when Sun comes on and u r blinded and fucked üëåüèªüëåüèª
08/05/2019, 23:18 - David;: Yeah yeah
08/05/2019, 23:35 - Hamish Sinclair: That looks fucking great
08/05/2019, 23:51 - David;: So this season in Europe we've beaten the champions of Spain, the champions of Germany, the champions of France and the runners up of Italy
08/05/2019, 23:52 - David;: (and lost to the champions of Serbia)
09/05/2019, 10:38 - Phill: Lol >Danny Baker

09/05/2019, 11:48 - / James Ball: Had no idea of racist link apparently
09/05/2019, 11:49 - David;: Always been a weird little bloke though
09/05/2019, 11:53 - David;: Enjoying the Mail's worldview falling apart as they try to make sense of their line on it. 'But royals good. But political correctness bad. But racism good'.
09/05/2019, 12:59 - Rob;: You can't plead ignorance as a comedian/journalist
09/05/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: The Hennessey defence
09/05/2019, 13:06 - Stefan;: Classic old white guy
09/05/2019, 13:07 - Stefan;: "I wasn't deliberately comparing the mixed race baby to a chimpanzee, I'm just so crashingly ignorant that I didn't know about this widespread stereotype"
09/05/2019, 14:06 - Rob;: The person I sit next to at work hasn't been able to come into work today because Spurs are in the Champions League final
09/05/2019, 14:07 - Jack G;: Arsenal fan? Or hungover Spurs fan?
09/05/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: Spurs season ticket holder
09/05/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: Just sent a message to our boss saying she couldn't make it because of the game. Fully accepted
09/05/2019, 14:09 - David;: Ha, brilliant
09/05/2019, 14:09 - David;: Due to hangover or just still honking too much to work?
09/05/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: I've got no more info than that
09/05/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: I imagine hungover
09/05/2019, 14:10 - Paul;: Too much honking
09/05/2019, 14:10 - David;: Would be good if he just needs a day to savour it. Completely sober.
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Jack G;: Any of you Liverpool fans thinking of going to Madrid for the final?
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: No chances of ticket
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Flights over a grand
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: No
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Jack G;: Ah
09/05/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: Grand for a flight, piss take
09/05/2019, 14:14 - David;: Nah, just froust in Chippy probably
09/05/2019, 14:15 - Rob;: I'm at a wedding. Second final in a row
09/05/2019, 14:52 - Paul;: Just drive it
09/05/2019, 15:03 - David;: Cycle
09/05/2019, 15:05 - Jack G;: That would be great, could have some lovely stops in south France
09/05/2019, 15:06 - David;: Pyrenees would be an issue
09/05/2019, 15:06 - Jack G;: Just cycle it mate, np
09/05/2019, 15:20 - David;: Jack Froome
09/05/2019, 17:29 - Jack G;: Just watched the latest GoT episode. How the hell did no one see Euron and his fleet coming? It was broad daylight, they had scout ships and the dragons flying above...
09/05/2019, 17:36 - Damian Rumble: I know... Ridiculous
09/05/2019, 17:36 - David;: Yeah was shit
09/05/2019, 17:36 - David;: They've fucked it
09/05/2019, 17:37 - Damian Rumble: Also... Scorpion balista <> early 18th century cannon
09/05/2019, 17:50 - Jack G;: If Tywin was still alive he‚Äôd wipe the floor with all of these jokers
09/05/2019, 17:52 - Stefan;: Yeah that was a massive tactical blunder
09/05/2019, 17:52 - Stefan;: Why isn't everyone calling for Danaerys's resignation and a full public inquiry?
09/05/2019, 18:02 - Paul;: Top story is Danny Baker on 6pm news lol
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Paul;: ‚ÄúA mistake‚Äù
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: Never heard of him until today
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: Who‚Äôs Raul Moat?
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Paul;: Tbh I‚Äôd never heard of him either I don‚Äôt think
09/05/2019, 18:07 - David;: Does the morning shit footbal chat on Saturdays before the actual games start. Odd fella
09/05/2019, 18:07 - David;: Lots of quirky shit that only makes sense if you born before 1960
09/05/2019, 18:24 - Damian Rumble: They tried and failed and now they can't try again until a full year has passed
09/05/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: He wrote a great sit com a while a go
09/05/2019, 20:03 - Jack G;: So if Arsenal get to the final in Baku, can Mkhitaryan okay? Very strong anti Armenian sentiment in Azerbaijan
09/05/2019, 20:03 - Jack G;: Play*
09/05/2019, 20:08 - Rob;: He didn't play when we were away at Quarabag for that reason, so perhaps not
09/05/2019, 20:09 - Rob;: That wouldn't worry me hugely tbh unless we had a number of midfield injuries
09/05/2019, 20:11 - Rob;: Perhaps it won't be an issue after that goal
09/05/2019, 20:17 - Jack G;: A banger
09/05/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Can you fuck off with GoT chat.
09/05/2019, 20:27 - Phill: No spoilers.

09/05/2019, 20:44 - Phill: Been busy with the new season of Champions League
09/05/2019, 20:44 - Phill: Its great.
09/05/2019, 20:47 - David;: Much better than GOT to be fair. GOT has become very average
09/05/2019, 20:48 - Phill: All the hype. DAT hubris.
09/05/2019, 20:49 - Jack G;: The production is still very high quality at least
09/05/2019, 22:48 - David;: Baku do you think you are?
09/05/2019, 22:48 - Jack G;: All 4 European finalists English then
09/05/2019, 22:49 - David;: Managed to be a shit game despite going to pennos
10/05/2019, 08:46 - Damian Rumble: Huge
10/05/2019, 08:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Have you bought a Tottenham shirt yet damo?

10/05/2019, 08:50 - Damian Rumble: It's in the post
10/05/2019, 08:52 - Jack G;: Imagine glory supporting spurs
10/05/2019, 08:52 - Damian Rumble: Though tbh I think I want Liverpool to win. Seems a huge injustice that Liverpool are unlikely to win the league despite only having lost one game to cities four
10/05/2019, 09:01 - Hamish Sinclair: JUSTICE
10/05/2019, 09:22 - Paul;: What‚Äôs the worst team to glory support? Would like a top 5 ranking

11/05/2019, 12:57 - David;: Damo is the algos. Underfed and emaciated.
11/05/2019, 12:58 - / James Ball: Damo, do you want bread crusts?
11/05/2019, 12:58 - / James Ball: An entire loaf thusly derived?
11/05/2019, 12:58 - David;: Chucking bread crusts to the data goose
11/05/2019, 13:13 - David;: Booked your flights to Baku yet Rob?
11/05/2019, 13:19 - Rob;: Yeah, yeah. The city Uefa don't want to visit
11/05/2019, 13:19 - Rob;: The 48hr midweek trip to the Caspian Sea
11/05/2019, 13:22 - David;: Will they even fill the stadium?
11/05/2019, 13:23 - / James Ball: Will went to see the Red Star v Liverpool game last year. Said it was pretty scary. A lot of Eastern Europeans with flares
11/05/2019, 13:23 - Rob;: Well you know about the 12,000 fan allocation
11/05/2019, 13:24 - / James Ball: In Belgrade I should add
11/05/2019, 13:24 - Rob;: So they're expecting to fit the other 55,000 with corporate / local punters
11/05/2019, 13:24 - Rob;: Madness

12/05/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: Post Wales last year was one of the most difficult fun come downs I've ever had.
12/05/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: I think Dave said something similar
12/05/2019, 12:33 - David;: Yeah brutal

12/05/2019, 16:59 - Jack G;: Cardiff fans chanting ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre just a shit Neil Warnock‚Äù at OGS
12/05/2019, 17:00 - Rob;: That's the Premier League title defence since that hat-trick of titles under Fergue
12/05/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: A decade ago
12/05/2019, 17:06 - Jack G;: Also a three way tie for golden boot
12/05/2019, 17:06 - Jack G;: Mane, Salah, Aubameyang
12/05/2019, 17:07 - Hamish Sinclair: What happens now? Does it go to assists?
12/05/2019, 17:07 - Jack G;: Not sure. If it was a two way tie they could have one boot each but three it‚Äôs up in the air
12/05/2019, 17:25 - David;: Surely should be based on games played?
12/05/2019, 17:27 - Jack G;: I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôve had a tie before so they‚Äôve never come up with rules. Pretty sure they‚Äôre all just sharing it
12/05/2019, 17:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Pretty sure the world cup one takes assists into account
12/05/2019, 18:10 - David;: Managed to beat my record FF points tally, surpassing the famous 12/13 team. So the day's not a total write off.
12/05/2019, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: ü•≥
12/05/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: They said on 5 live the boot is shared
12/05/2019, 18:22 - Rob;: I believe Salah gets weekends
12/05/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: Spurs' ILLEGAL offside goal against us earlier in the season cost us a top four place in the end
12/05/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: I can see no other factors at play
12/05/2019, 18:27 - David;: What's the treble you're going to win this year?
12/05/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: That will be hard to work out
12/05/2019, 18:28 - David;: Finishing above spurs was one of the titles in the treble I believe
12/05/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Europa League would be the bedrock were that to happen
12/05/2019, 18:29 - David;: Yeah. What other straws can be clutched?
12/05/2019, 18:29 - David;: Finishing above United. Title 2
12/05/2019, 18:30 - David;: Qualifying for champions league of you win europa as well. That's three
12/05/2019, 18:30 - David;: Or winning more trophies than spurs if they lose the final.
12/05/2019, 18:34 - David;: Aubameyang getting 1/3rd of the golden boot. Could get some shitty mileage out of that surely
12/05/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: It's not a bumper year
12/05/2019, 18:54 - David;: Do you think Emery should stay?
12/05/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Yeah, and probably regardless of what happens in the Europa League final. It was always going to be different following Wenger, and taking on a squad that was so uncompetitive last season. He's done just enough to given the time to build a team he wants next summer
12/05/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Will be judged more harshly next season
12/05/2019, 18:57 - David;: Yeah I suppose not really his signings yet.
12/05/2019, 18:58 - David;: Worrying that you seemed to get worse not better though.
12/05/2019, 18:58 - David;: He should have swapped the second and 1st half of the season
12/05/2019, 19:00 - Jack G;: Need to bring in a big CB and CM. Your Van Dijk, your Kant√©
12/05/2019, 19:01 - David;: CM fine with torreira, xhaka, Guendouzi surely? Think you need decent wide forwards and better defenders
12/05/2019, 19:02 - David;: Also replace Ozil because he brings too much butt hurt
12/05/2019, 19:02 - Jack G;: Hmm not sure. A lot of the mid table teams have very athletic midfields that they‚Äôve struggled to deal with
12/05/2019, 19:03 - David;: Iwobi not a top 4 player
12/05/2019, 19:04 - Phill: >OGS
12/05/2019, 19:04 - Phill: >Spamchester United
12/05/2019, 19:05 - Phill: >Old Toilet
12/05/2019, 19:05 - Rob;: Need a Ramsay replacement and Ozil improvement. Wide forward. Top class CB and back-up right back
12/05/2019, 19:07 - Rob;: Iwobi improved vastly this season. Physically imposing with a good work rate. I'd like to see him stay, but become more of a squad player
12/05/2019, 23:15 - David;: Such a shit goal of the season
12/05/2019, 23:16 - David;: Only 6
12/05/2019, 23:16 - David;: Should obviously be every goal of the month

13/05/2019, 10:54 - David;: Historically under-appreciated in English football
13/05/2019, 10:55 - Rob;: Yeah, goal of the month puts the blooter on a pedestal. Glorifying wasteful individuality

18/05/2019, 16:54 - Phill: There's always next year. A rebuilding season is required.
18/05/2019, 17:04 - Rob;: Dave I like that because you haven't named it, that  has been recorded as a default 'afternoon run'
18/05/2019, 17:05 - Rob;: 'oh that? That 18 kilometre long, 933m climb? A mere afternoon run'
18/05/2019, 17:06 - Rob;: Ks 6-9 look interesting
18/05/2019, 17:16 - David;: I am dissolved
18/05/2019, 17:27 - David;: The long dark night of the Pony Path
18/05/2019, 17:28 - David;: Someone snapped their ankle on the descent.
18/05/2019, 17:36 - David;: Hamish's friend Todd summit in 4th place overall. Obscene
18/05/2019, 17:43 - David;: Just casually pulled that out
18/05/2019, 17:43 - David;: Hadn't really been training
18/05/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: He just took Hamish's place last minute?
18/05/2019, 17:46 - David;: Nah was always going to run but had an injury and had mainly been cycling
18/05/2019, 18:23 - Paul;: I ‚ù§ petrol
18/05/2019, 18:24 - David;: We were remembering the time in Wales rob downed a gallon of water  as soon as we arrived.
18/05/2019, 18:28 - Jack G;: Mad lad
18/05/2019, 18:41 - Rob;: And spewed it immediately
18/05/2019, 18:41 - Rob;: Hard to remember why that happened
18/05/2019, 18:43 - David;: Yeha that's what we were trying to fathom
18/05/2019, 18:43 - David;: Just wales. That can happen
18/05/2019, 23:05 - / James Ball: I have photos of that occurring at home

19/05/2019, 14:53 - Phill: Hamish's friend was talking about the quality of the ass on who at the hackney half. How would you rate the ass?
19/05/2019, 15:04 - Rob;: Highly
19/05/2019, 16:09 - David;: Ras Y Gader had surprisingly good ass. From zero expectatoond
19/05/2019, 16:11 - Sam;: Yet another Dembele in the mix. A mister karamoko dembele
19/05/2019, 16:21 - Phill: Hamish was saying he was following a mesmerising ass yesterday, and then said ass was told to turn around by a Marshall
19/05/2019, 16:21 - Phill: >the under 18s race
19/05/2019, 16:28 - / James Ball: I'm enjoying reading some 16th century medical case records published recently.
19/05/2019, 16:28 - / James Ball: Haunted or bewitched.
It is of Saturn in Libra. Water of a reasonable colour but full of motes, hairs. Once in a month to stool & then very black & hard, but vomits up all things he takes. He persuades himself that there crept into his mouth some evil thing lying under a hedge.

It's the best part of a year away but this looks like an epic night...
20/05/2019, 16:23 - Phill: >that feel when you shit a perfect shit and the droplet of water from the plop hits your asshole in the bullseye.
20/05/2019, 21:24 - David;: üëç
20/05/2019, 21:25 - David;: Good pace
21/05/2019, 09:30 - Damian Rumble: Are people done with GoT yet?
21/05/2019, 09:30 - David;: Yep
21/05/2019, 09:31 - Jack G;: Yeah
21/05/2019, 09:40 - Rob;: Yeah
21/05/2019, 09:40 - Rob;: Fucken dun with it
21/05/2019, 09:51 - David;: Thought it was an okay last epi considering how they've already fucked everything up
21/05/2019, 09:51 - David;: Did as much as they could really
21/05/2019, 09:55 - Rob;: I think the outcomes on paper are fine, just feel they got to them in a very cack-handed way. That huge cut to a meeting of people you'd forgotten existed
21/05/2019, 09:55 - Rob;: It looked great though. The imagery in the first half was excellent
21/05/2019, 09:56 - Paul;: Won‚Äôt be watching the last season. Not going to ruin it for myself
21/05/2019, 09:56 - Paul;: Bask in the glory of 7 seasons
21/05/2019, 12:13 - Damian Rumble: My expectations were rock bottom going in and even then they managed to fuck up. Bran like wtf?
21/05/2019, 13:26 - David;: Nah that made sense. Couldn't be Jon or Dani too obvious.
21/05/2019, 13:27 - David;: Drogon did everyone a solid
21/05/2019, 13:27 - Jack G;: Bran the biggest douche though. He knew everything that would happen, but allowed it so he could rule
21/05/2019, 13:34 - Paul;: What did bran do?
21/05/2019, 13:39 - Damian Rumble: Sweet fuck all
21/05/2019, 13:39 - Damian Rumble: The ultimate troll....
21/05/2019, 13:40 - Paul;: I need more to go on
21/05/2019, 13:41 - Stefan;: People are debating whether Drogon was really smart (recognised that the lust for power represented by the throne killed Dany), or really stupid (thought the chair made of knives killed her with a knife)
21/05/2019, 13:41 - David;: Became king. That's the bullet point
21/05/2019, 13:42 - Jack G;: I like the symbolism of destroying the throne that caused all of the death over the last 8 seasons
21/05/2019, 13:42 - David;: Yeah
21/05/2019, 13:42 - David;: Worked
21/05/2019, 13:42 - Stefan;: It was a good moment
21/05/2019, 13:43 - Stefan;: Also liked the visual scene of Dany looking mega fascist on the ruined red keep
21/05/2019, 13:43 - David;: They salvaged an iota of credibility after a shit series
21/05/2019, 13:44 - Sam;: Yeah, just should have done it over 9 or 10 hour long episodes
21/05/2019, 13:45 - Paul;: I don‚Äôt recognise this series. Waiting for the remake
21/05/2019, 13:47 - Jack G;: There‚Äôs negative hype though, surely a go?
21/05/2019, 13:52 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/05/2019, 13:56 - Rob;: I like that Jon was sentenced to a life of service at Castle Black, then gets there and it's just his mate frousting
21/05/2019, 13:56 - Rob;: Him and Tormund and really let themselves go north of the wall now
21/05/2019, 13:57 - David;: Like a big Wales trip over the wall
21/05/2019, 13:58 - Rob;: Yeah. It'll be grand
21/05/2019, 15:08 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I enjoyed the overture to nazi Germany there...  Just about the only good bit of the final episode. All downhill from there...
21/05/2019, 15:10 - Damian Rumble: They literally couldn't have picked a character that it made less sense to be king. Literally zero back story or character development.
21/05/2019, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: Has ability to see all of time but can't be fucked to use it ... Make that man king and send the actual heir to the throne to wall to guard it from a threat that no longer exists...
21/05/2019, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: Butt hurt
21/05/2019, 15:14 - Paul;: Your butthurt is extreme
21/05/2019, 15:16 - Hamish Sinclair: But hes actually the king beyond the wall is t he? Complete stark domination, Stanza controls the north, bran controls he 6 kingdoms and aryeh is going to take over the world in her spin off series
21/05/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: Could really get behind some good old fashioned colonialism in that
21/05/2019, 15:49 - Stefan;: I'm hoping for a spin off comedy series about Tyrion's small council. Thick of It style.
21/05/2019, 16:36 - David;: Focussing mainly on communications strategy and the PR operation?
21/05/2019, 16:37 - David;: This was the whole point though. Didn't want it hence only person fit for it. Also because not the legitimate heir etc. it avoids the endless spiral of dynastic politics that got them into the war in the first place. Made sense to me
21/05/2019, 16:38 - David;: Plus seeing all of time. Get that on a throne of bread
21/05/2019, 16:41 - David;: The episode where Arya brings smallpox to a population lacking any immunity and causes accidental genocide. Looking forward to how they plug that into her post-feminist story arc.

22/05/2019, 21:37 - Rob;: I don't think hop house particularly tastes very hoppy
22/05/2019, 21:38 - Rob;: Hello I'm Miss Nomer
22/05/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Hoppy being a trendy thing to say about beer these days, that makes a lager brewed by the world's second biggest distiller sound like a craft, indie ale
22/05/2019, 21:45 - Phill: Well they're not going to sell a beer that's called "Shart House" are they
22/05/2019, 21:46 - Rob;: Samuel Thornton's 5.5% Thunder Piss
22/05/2019, 21:46 - Paul;: Someone at work said the exact same today
22/05/2019, 21:46 - Paul;: The culling
22/05/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: Sam Thornton's Big Curry Buster
22/05/2019, 21:48 - Phill: Would like to start a brewery where the artwork is the deco-obcenia and the names of the drink are "Shart" which is a dark, malty ale, "Menstrual Discharge" which is a red ale. "Piss" a pale.
22/05/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: Next time I'm looking for something to draw I'll do that
22/05/2019, 21:50 - Phill: "Ass Pus"
22/05/2019, 21:50 - Phill: A sour.
22/05/2019, 21:51 - Phill: The bottle art is just people shitting, pissing, sharting, fucking.
22/05/2019, 21:52 - Phill: "Andy Colon" - a stout.
22/05/2019, 21:53 - David;: The over hopping of everything. It has to stop.
22/05/2019, 21:53 - Phill: I think that's why I've reverted back to lager recently.
22/05/2019, 21:53 - Paul;: Yeah hops are shit. Can‚Äôt stand hoppiness
22/05/2019, 21:54 - Rob;: Unhoppy customers
22/05/2019, 21:56 - Phill: The concept of the triple hop.
22/05/2019, 21:56 - Phill: >
22/05/2019, 21:57 - Damian Rumble: Nah hops are great what are you on about
22/05/2019, 21:57 - Phill: "we need to hop this again"
22/05/2019, 21:57 - Phill: "one more time"
22/05/2019, 21:58 - Rob;: Are you off all pale ales because of the double hopping? Or is it just the gratuitous third?
22/05/2019, 21:59 - Phill: I'm a fan of the classic 4% refreshing pale ale. Its the 6%, thick, triple hopped syrups that troll
22/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: I really hate high % beer too
22/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: New York craft is rancid. 6.7% morning-ruiners
22/05/2019, 22:05 - David;: No pale ales ever. They have to stop as well
22/05/2019, 22:05 - Paul;: Madness. This is why you can‚Äôt be trusted
22/05/2019, 22:07 - Phill: Create a beer that's hopped with weed. Would buy.
22/05/2019, 22:08 - David;: This. >Any beer over 4.5%
22/05/2019, 22:09 - Paul;: All about cider
22/05/2019, 22:09 - David;: What was the great fullers beer in the Chequers that was 3.8%. Could just sink it back
22/05/2019, 22:09 - David;: Citrusy
22/05/2019, 22:10 - Paul;: Nothing better than pissing rancid Apple the morning after

23/05/2019, 15:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Maybe he will realise noone will ever respect his achievements at Abu Dhabi FC

24/05/2019, 09:50 - Rob;: June 10

24/05/2019, 10:12 - Jack G;: Her attempt at emotion was more like a tantrum
24/05/2019, 10:14 - Damian Rumble: Well I can empathize that she must be feeling pretty angry/upset at the moment
24/05/2019, 10:16 - Paul;: She is your doppelg√§nger after all
24/05/2019, 10:18 - Rob;: Wonder how many prime ministers we might get during the time David Cameron was meant to be in office
24/05/2019, 10:18 - Rob;: Like all the United manager's during the length of Moyes' six year deal
24/05/2019, 10:22 - Damian Rumble: Untill 2020? Could easily be another 2 I reckon
24/05/2019, 10:36 - Rob;: Moyes to lead us out of Europe
24/05/2019, 10:38 - David;: The first lizard prime minister. An inspiration
24/05/2019, 10:39 - David;: So PM Boris. Ah.

24/05/2019, 10:58 - Jack G;: She‚Äôs not one for improvisation. Anything off script and she‚Äôs flustered
24/05/2019, 10:59 - David;: Last 3 conservative PMs all destroyed by Europe
24/05/2019, 11:38 - / James Ball: Jonson or Raab would also get a lot of hate from the majority of the UK as well

24/05/2019, 13:42 - Stefan;: I think so yeah, but we haven't collated the data yet
24/05/2019, 13:42 - David;: They should get 10%+ of national vote share.
24/05/2019, 13:43 - David;: How do you get a sense of it - do the counters leak to the activists?
24/05/2019, 13:45 - Damian Rumble: You suspect the greens will be looking to mop up labour remainers. Lib Dems Tory and labour remainers. Whilst Brexit take all the hard Brexit vote. Going to be a blood bath for the main parties for sure...
24/05/2019, 13:48 - Stefan;: They're just counting the number of ballot papers at this stage. While they do that we can see the votes cast and do our own tally
24/05/2019, 13:48 - Stefan;: It's not mega accurate but we get a sample
24/05/2019, 13:49 - David;: estimated % of votes?
24/05/2019, 14:07 - / James Ball: I expect Tories 4th overall and labour 5th
24/05/2019, 14:08 - David;: Polls suggest Labour will get more votes than tories, but behind Brexit party and possibly Lib Dems
24/05/2019, 14:09 - Paul;: >shit dems
24/05/2019, 14:10 - / James Ball: I think:
brexit party
Ukip

Tories
labour
24/05/2019, 14:10 - / James Ball: Not sure where greens will fit in
24/05/2019, 14:13 - David;: No way UKIP will be that high, Brexit party will hoover up their votes.
24/05/2019, 14:13 - Paul;: UKIP will be bottom of that list
24/05/2019, 14:14 - Paul;: Brexit 
Labour
Lib
Green
Tory
24/05/2019, 14:15 - David;: Yeah, with UKIP/Change on like 3-4% each at the bottom.
24/05/2019, 14:15 - David;: Tories/Green will be close
24/05/2019, 14:34 - Damian Rumble: Ukip are dead
24/05/2019, 14:36 - / James Ball: I just have a feeling they'll resurge

24/05/2019, 14:37 - / James Ball: Change UK will be bottom I agree
24/05/2019, 15:45 - Stefan;: Turnout is flat or down (compared to 2014) in leave voting areas and up in remain areas

24/05/2019, 15:45 - Damian Rumble: Evidence of the above
24/05/2019, 15:47 - Damian Rumble: Tbh that make sense to me. There is a very loud ultra Brexit contingent but I can't imagine why most people who voted for Brexit would bother to turn up to vote in a election they don't want and believe we will be rid of soon
24/05/2019, 16:11 - / James Ball: Yes exactly. Why vote people into a job you believe shouldn't exist
24/05/2019, 17:53 - David;: What's to stop non-conservatives signing up as members temporarily to vote against Boris then giving up membership the day after?
24/05/2019, 17:53 - David;: Other than fact it would give a temporary cash boost to tories
24/05/2019, 17:55 - Phill: Don't you have to have been a member for 3 months to get a vote?
24/05/2019, 18:23 - Phill: So I was on site today, and found two of our subcontractors asleep on a roof

28/05/2019, 13:25 - Damian Rumble: BBC News - Alastair Campbell 'expelled' from Labour Party
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48434842

I love how tone deaf this response from labour party is.. party member dares to vote for another party, along with many others, in protest at policy, contributing to one of the worse results on record. 

Obviously expelling that individual immediately is the proportionate response to demonstrate that the party is willing to listen to the voters and make an effort to win them  back. Thank you Mr Corbyn.
28/05/2019, 13:34 - Paul;: What happened with everyone not being able to get enough of Corbyn and annoyingly chanting his name? Where did they go?
28/05/2019, 13:38 - Jack G;: They finally realised that he‚Äôs a huge brexiteer despite attempting to claim otherwise
28/05/2019, 13:40 - Damian Rumble: It's been very quiet ever since he was outed as an anti-semite
28/05/2019, 13:41 - Damian Rumble: Even my card carrying corbynista housemate now thinks he should go
28/05/2019, 13:41 - Paul;: He was just a meme really

28/05/2019, 13:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Seems a slightly outdated policy, although I'm pretty sure most major parties apply this rule into their membership, the Tories kicked out Michael heseltine last week for the same reason
28/05/2019, 13:49 - Paul;: Didn‚Äôt he get wheeled out one year to great fanfare and even more chanting?
28/05/2019, 13:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Mainstage
28/05/2019, 13:54 - Paul;: Would have been good to see May brought out. With dancing. The sheer awkwardness would be worth it

07/06/2019, 10:24 - Damian Rumble: Came a cross a cool feature on Spotify the other day. Normally on my own play lists you play a track to the end before beginning a new one (with some option of cross-fade). 

However, I picked up one of Spotify's own playlists that it had recommended to me. I noticed that in the new playlist, as a track ended... The the app would automatically find a convenient spot in the next playlist, beat match and fade over. The effect was so good that it took me several tracks to realise that I wasn't listening to a human recorded mix but rather the AI in Spotify was mixing live! 

I thought that was pretty cool...
07/06/2019, 10:25 - Damian Rumble: I had the playlist on shuffle btw
07/06/2019, 10:25 - Rob;: Is that something you need to turn on?
07/06/2019, 10:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Woold be interesting to repeat that over the same playlist and see if it goes the same route each time
07/06/2019, 10:26 - Hamish Sinclair: How do you turn it on?
07/06/2019, 10:32 - David;: I don't like change
07/06/2019, 10:32 - Damian Rumble: I had a good look around and couldn't find anything signalling as the where this feature is. My bet is that they are training thier neural net models it in a number of pre-set playlists before making it widely available. Watch this space.
07/06/2019, 10:33 - Damian Rumble: I found this playlist list under the 'keep the vibe going' section
07/06/2019, 10:33 - David;: An how much Mandy had you had when this occured?

08/06/2019, 14:26 - David;: Just at sainsbury's. Asian guy in front of me had cleaned them out of celery and bought nothing else
08/06/2019, 14:26 - David;: About 30 packs of celery
08/06/2019, 14:26 - David;: That's the whole shop
08/06/2019, 14:28 - David;: Curious to know what is long-term strategy is for that quantity of celery

08/06/2019, 14:28 - Jack G;: Huge batch of soup?
08/06/2019, 14:29 - Jack G;: Just honking soup for the next week
08/06/2019, 14:34 - David;: Pure celery soup. That's a very close diet. Would go right through you
08/06/2019, 14:34 - David;: Not enough to sustain a human surely
08/06/2019, 14:35 - / James Ball: Celery is so shit tier except as a flavourant
08/06/2019, 14:35 - / James Ball: maybe he was going to pickle it or something asian

09/06/2019, 12:25 - Damian Rumble: I actually find Michael Gove more appealing now he's confessed to being a coked up hack 20 years ago. Like we all know Boris was the same but he still tries to hide it from everyone because it's politically advantageous...
09/06/2019, 12:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Think that's exactly why hes done it damo, you've fallen for it üé£
09/06/2019, 12:43 - Damian Rumble: Haha could be. Assumed Boris had leaked a story as revenge for knifing him in 2016...
09/06/2019, 12:44 - Stefan;: Can you imagine anything worse than being stuck with a coked up Gove at a party
09/06/2019, 12:49 - Damian Rumble: Being at the same party in a circle of people including Teresa May... one by one everyone leaves until you realise you've been left as the only person talking to her and can't now escape without looking like a massive douche. She then proceeds to have a breakdown about how Boris bullied her out of office and you have to stay there and comfort her whilst simultaneously wishing you could tell her exactly what you thought/get out of there as quickly as possible.

10/06/2019, 22:30 - Damian Rumble: I love how pensioners are losing thier shit over having to pay for a TV licence now. Like you got free higher education, lived through the summer of love, got jobs and cheap property in the 80s boom years and then got to fuck everyone over by voting for brexit... But oh no...now I have to pay ¬£144 a year to 'keep in touch with the world because I have no friends'. Cry me a River bitches.
10/06/2019, 22:38 - David;: Manchester United will give Spain goalkeeper David de Gea ¬£20m if the 28-year-old leaves for Paris St-Germain this summer.

11/06/2019, 18:05 - David;: Hope they fix the fucking weapon system
11/06/2019, 18:05 - Paul;: What‚Äôs wrong with the weapon system?
11/06/2019, 18:06 - David;: All your weapons break constantly
11/06/2019, 18:07 - David;: So never feels that good getting anything new and there's no point using the decent weapons
11/06/2019, 18:07 - David;: Better to use the shit weapons most of the time
11/06/2019, 18:08 - Rob;: You see why they have them break, but they just need to give you _some_ time with the good stuff
11/06/2019, 18:08 - Rob;: Very pleased to be getting another game
11/06/2019, 18:08 - Jack G;: Yeah hopefully they increase weapon durability
11/06/2019, 18:09 - David;: Why? Skyrim works fine without that mechanic.
11/06/2019, 18:09 - Jack G;: #Realism
11/06/2019, 18:11 - David;: So it's real for a sword to break after swinging it 10 times Jack? Is it real to live in a world called Hyrule with fairies and divine beasts and magical creatures Jack?
11/06/2019, 18:11 - Sam;: Lol
11/06/2019, 18:12 - Paul;: Jack have you been in hyrule again
11/06/2019, 18:12 - David;: I don't play Zelda for the gritty realism
11/06/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: A lot of the game is about making the best of the resources you have, getting better at using them wisely. I think you need some level of weapon damage so you can't just kill one Lynel once and use its sword to kill everything forever in one hit
11/06/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: Weapons go, you just have to get used to it
11/06/2019, 18:15 - Rob;: Had a battle axe once, chopped 10 woods, battle axe ded, move on
11/06/2019, 18:15 - David;: Jaaaaack

11/06/2019, 18:17 - Paul;: Only 10 wood
11/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: Basically I enjoyed Skyrim much more and that was exclusively to do with the weapons system. The world in Zelda is bigger and better but it completely ruined my enjoyment of it
11/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: Destroyed any sense of progression
11/06/2019, 18:18 - Paul;: Still get weapon fatigue in that?

11/06/2019, 18:27 - Jack G;: Will trade you 10 wood for 3 wheat, 2 sheep and a brick
11/06/2019, 18:30 - David;: No. Mana drains in magical weapons but you can recharge. Weapons don't break. Changes absolutely everything
11/06/2019, 18:32 - Phill: Classic WoW > all
11/06/2019, 18:32 - Phill: Taken a week off to honk it
11/06/2019, 18:33 - David;: Can it ever be the same without being in the clan?
11/06/2019, 18:33 - David;: Without the corporate structure
11/06/2019, 18:33 - David;: The org chart
11/06/2019, 18:34 - Jack G;: So much time required though. Basically turns into a second job

11/06/2019, 18:35 - Phill: Yeah yeah yeah.
11/06/2019, 18:35 - Jack G;: Are you still playing as a gnome Phil?
11/06/2019, 18:35 - David;: Climb the greasy pole once more
11/06/2019, 18:35 - Phill: Lol I get my old role back
11/06/2019, 18:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Do we have an objective way of measuring your performance at work during this period?
11/06/2019, 18:36 - Phill: Yeah yeah. Gnome lock.
11/06/2019, 18:37 - David;: Senior assistant Gnome Lock
11/06/2019, 18:37 - David;: Should get business cards

11/06/2019, 18:38 - Phill: Then it's just evenings grinding dungeons
11/06/2019, 18:38 - Phill: Can't wait. My literal dick.
11/06/2019, 18:40 - David;: Lol grinding. And you've chosen to do that
11/06/2019, 18:40 - David;: How does Becca feel - concerned?
11/06/2019, 18:47 - Phill: "h-h-hey, I'm taking a week off work to play w-w-wow in August"

11/06/2019, 19:17 - Phill: "no"

11/06/2019, 19:18 - Phill: But
11/06/2019, 19:18 - Phill: "no"
11/06/2019, 19:21 - Phill: "but what about Stranglethorn vale. Booty bay. Arathi Highlands."
11/06/2019, 19:21 - Phill: "I need a partner to help me bring Upper Blackrock Spire for my Tier 1 gear"

11/06/2019, 19:42 - David;: üëç
11/06/2019, 20:22 - David;: Rob, fun biology fact. When humans shagged Neanderthals it only ever produced female children
11/06/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: Interesting
11/06/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: So did they have an inviable Y chromosome?
11/06/2019, 20:32 - Rob;: Unviable
11/06/2019, 20:34 - Rob;: We only got proper evidence of the first neanderthal-sapiens cross breeding last year
11/06/2019, 20:36 - Rob;: Ah, that was first neaderthal-denisovan  cross
11/06/2019, 20:37 - Phill: https://youtu.be/qQEYrNpYIO0
11/06/2019, 20:39 - David;: Quite the wrong cross
11/06/2019, 20:39 - David;: Not sure, I'm in a conversation with a very eccentric old man who seems to know a lot about human evolution but might also be talking bollocks
11/06/2019, 20:40 - Rob;: I see
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: It makes sort of sense - as species get more distance their ability to breed gradually decreases, rather than stopping immediately
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: Like how you can get a mule, ass, liger or tigon etc
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: I wish other human species had made it. Would have made the world more fun
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: /violent
11/06/2019, 20:42 - David;: He was drawing the mule comparison
11/06/2019, 20:43 - Rob;: You wouldn't intentionally have a mule-child would you?

11/06/2019, 20:44 - David;: So the Asians were all over the densovans
11/06/2019, 20:45 - David;: Loved a bit of exotic denisovan daliance
11/06/2019, 20:45 - David;: We were loving the Neanderthals. Africans were just nah we'll stick to actual humans
11/06/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: There were probably far more different human species and sub-species in Africa that never left though
11/06/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: Ethnic africans have far more genetic diversity than people with other backgrounds
11/06/2019, 20:47 - David;: Do you think it was a bit of a faux par to have shagged a denisovan. Like you'd had a real grotty mad one
11/06/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: They split off from neanderthals

12/06/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: He was great on fantasy around that time. Super cheap because mistakes were always his fault, so no one go him in, but Wigan actually came like 11th and conceded relatively few goals, and fantasy punishes all defenders equally
12/06/2019, 14:43 - Damian Rumble: I imagine this is what I look like playing football...
12/06/2019, 14:50 - David;: Yes you look like a large stocky black man

13/06/2019, 09:22 - Rob;: Always good to get the hard games done. 'Easy run-ins' _always_ go well. Always.

14/06/2019, 13:47 - Paul;: Got 75 goals in 50 games in youth career though
14/06/2019, 13:48 - David;: Fornally introduced

15/06/2019, 11:01 - Phill: Why are Qatar and Japan on the Copa America ?
15/06/2019, 11:02 - Damian Rumble: Presumably Qatar paid alot of money...
15/06/2019, 11:03 - David;: Jexit
15/06/2019, 11:10 - Damian Rumble: Fun fact. If two more Tory MPs quit the conservative party then even with the DUP on board they won't have a majority.

15/06/2019, 12:09 - Sam;: He also says that no one would say anything if it was two Azerbaijani team playing the final in London
15/06/2019, 12:41 - Damian Rumble: Homo sapiens habitate the yukon. Clearly we should hold the next Europa League finals there
15/06/2019, 12:43 - Rob;: If it was all fucking Homo hablis then fuck it, no final, but have you seen the sapiens levels down there?
15/06/2019, 12:44 - Paul;: It‚Äôs about time these football hooligans had a bit of culture outside the local weatherspoons. Good to have it in Baku
15/06/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: But almost everyone there was local

18/06/2019, 18:11 - Jack G;: Right*
18/06/2019, 18:13 - David;: Not really makes it easier to paint himself as the Brexit purist etc.
18/06/2019, 18:14 - Jack G;: Sure but they‚Äôll all gang up on him for a bit of Boris bashing
18/06/2019, 18:14 - David;: But he's foppish Jack. That apparently trumps all other considerations.

18/06/2019, 18:16 - Jack G;: 70% of the Tory membership said they‚Äôd rather see the end of the party than lose brexit
18/06/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: There were rumours that Johnson was lending some votes to Hunt as he thought he was the least threatening of those likely to make top 2
18/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: So we're not proroguing
18/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: I'm prorogue
18/06/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: Though as Johnson gained votes I guess that didn't happen

18/06/2019, 18:18 - Jack G;: Rory the Tory sneaking through
18/06/2019, 18:19 - Damian Rumble: I'm definitely team Rory. The only sane one left. We need to see someone whose not afraid to call Boris on this bullshit, rather than trying to peddle thier own bullshit
18/06/2019, 18:19 - David;: It really isn't. This is such a fantasy unfortunately. It just means they have to inflict a no deal brexit on us all to appease their members
18/06/2019, 18:20 - David;: Basically there are more cunts, so they have to brand themselves purely to cunts. Then they'll be fine again
18/06/2019, 18:20 - Rob;: Can't wait for the hardship to forge our generation into something great
18/06/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: Can't wait to be lauded as a hero for going without salad for two years
18/06/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: Get us a cenotaph
18/06/2019, 18:21 - Damian Rumble: No deal brexit = massive damage to the economy and the more central parts of the part defecting to the Tories. 

No brexit = massive damage to the Tories reputation and the majority of thier voters defecting to Nigel Farage

18/06/2019, 18:29 - Jack G;: Computers all the way down
18/06/2019, 18:32 - David;: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the arrogance. It‚Äôs the contempt. That‚Äôs what gets me. It‚Äôs Gordon Brown‚Äôs apparent belief that he can just trample on the democratic will of the British people. It‚Äôs at moments like this that I think the political world has gone mad, and I am alone in detecting the gigantic fraud.‚Äù 

‚ÄúThey voted for Anthony Charles Lynton Blair to serve as their leader. They were at no stage invited to vote on whether Gordon Brown should be PM‚Ä¶ They voted for Tony, and yet they now get Gordon, and a transition about as democratically proper as the transition from Claudius to Nero. It is a scandal. Why are we all conniving in this stitch-up? This is nothing less than a palace coup‚Ä¶ with North Korean servility, the Labour Party has handed power over to the brooding Scottish power-maniac.‚Äù
18/06/2019, 18:32 - David;: Amazing he's not got more stick for this
18/06/2019, 18:33 - Jack G;: The lack of accountability in politics these days is mental
18/06/2019, 18:34 - David;: ‚ÄúThe extraordinary thing is that it looks as though he will now be in 10 Downing Street for three years, and without a mandate from the British people. No one elected Gordon Brown as Prime Minister‚Äù
18/06/2019, 18:34 - Damian Rumble: It's because the been avoiding press coverage.... Page 1 of the "Teresa may manual on how to fuck up an election"

18/06/2019, 20:09 - Rob;: It's not lost value, I can tell you that
18/06/2019, 20:32 - David;: A real array of cunts
18/06/2019, 20:32 - David;: A concatenation of cunts
18/06/2019, 20:33 - / James Ball: if they are concatenated then they surely become a human centipede of cunts
18/06/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Rory Stewart best of a shite bunch.
18/06/2019, 20:34 - David;: I was thinking more of ideological linkage
18/06/2019, 20:34 - David;: Yea

18/06/2019, 20:36 - David;: A pointless point

18/06/2019, 21:06 - Phill: Blend Molly and Amber. The ultimate rut bot.
18/06/2019, 21:07 - David;: Lol, two very different bodies to blend. Are you meaning complete merge or taking some features intact and combining with others?
18/06/2019, 21:07 - David;: You'd end up with hair half way between frizzy and black and straight and blonde.
18/06/2019, 21:08 - Phill: Just taking the best features
18/06/2019, 21:10 - Phill: >Maura
18/06/2019, 21:10 - Phill: Yewande and Vincent Kompany not working.

18/06/2019, 21:11 - David;: Like when you see the red woman in game of thrones in her true state
18/06/2019, 21:11 - Phill: Lol. He personality is rancid as well.
18/06/2019, 21:12 - Phill: Shes like a fly in your bedroom when you're trying to sleep and you can hear it buzzing.
18/06/2019, 21:21 - David;: Elma so rotten
18/06/2019, 21:25 - David;: Accent repulsive
18/06/2019, 21:26 - Phill: Yeah

18/06/2019, 21:37 - Sam;: Milk looking most grotty

19/06/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: Is Boris a sort of polar bear?
19/06/2019, 17:02 - Rob;: Rory a cub?
19/06/2019, 17:04 - David;: Rory the Twink, with his cheeky walking
19/06/2019, 17:04 - Phill: Lol. >Twink
19/06/2019, 17:04 - Phill: Boris "Johnson" Johnson
19/06/2019, 17:11 - Rob;: I think I want a full gay profile of them all
19/06/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: And that's how politics should be done now
19/06/2019, 17:12 - David;: You should draw that probably
19/06/2019, 17:12 - Stefan;: Lol, Rob and Dave you know more than I'd credited you for üëç
19/06/2019, 17:14 - Stefan;: The vote will be scattered   - Rory is the ageing twink type, Boris could be the "bi-curious" married daddy (but that's a stretch)
19/06/2019, 17:14 - Stefan;: Raab was the great unifier
19/06/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: Are there even terms for people like Javid, perfect dome men?
19/06/2019, 17:22 - David;: The egg bat hybrid
19/06/2019, 17:23 - Rob;: Asian Mr Burns, as Hamish once said
19/06/2019, 17:24 - Stefan;: We're still working on a sub-tribe for that look - very difficult to categorise
19/06/2019, 17:25 - Stefan;: He does have gay face though
19/06/2019, 17:25 - David;: Hunt could be an earnest otter
19/06/2019, 17:25 - David;: Probably shaves his chest or something weird though
19/06/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: I don't think Hunt could handle being gay
19/06/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: He's not fun enough
19/06/2019, 17:27 - David;: No he is the straightest man alive
19/06/2019, 17:27 - Rob;: Is this a look that lets you know someone is gay?
19/06/2019, 17:27 - David;: Be surprised if Gove hasn't dabbled
19/06/2019, 17:27 - Rob;: Yeah, the ventriloquist doll sub-sect of being gay
19/06/2019, 17:28 - David;: Some coke fueled chemsex here and there
19/06/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: Probably a bit of public school wanking off an older boy
19/06/2019, 17:29 - Stefan;: Literally just how someone's face looks in a photo - you can usually tell
19/06/2019, 17:29 - Stefan;: Gove was 100% someone's fag at school
19/06/2019, 17:29 - David;: Yeah yeah
19/06/2019, 17:29 - Stefan;: But he is also a lizard in a human suit
19/06/2019, 17:30 - Rob;: And a little boy whose been accidentally made CEO
19/06/2019, 17:31 - David;: It's like when you see those public school teenagers who've dressed up in nice suits and are still drunk on it
19/06/2019, 17:32 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
19/06/2019, 17:32 - Rob;: Like the Tory teenager getting to ask a question on Question Time
19/06/2019, 17:33 - Rob;: Overcome with excitement
19/06/2019, 17:34 - David;: Yeah, has come to question time dressed in a tweed jacket and tie
19/06/2019, 17:34 - David;: Possibly even a waistcoat
19/06/2019, 17:36 - Stefan;: They are the very worst
19/06/2019, 17:36 - Rob;: The thickest triple Windsor knot in the tie
19/06/2019, 17:36 - Stefan;: Trying to think who at Chippy would have been like that. Joe Taylor is the closest match but still far off
19/06/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: I had Joe Taylor in mind
19/06/2019, 17:39 - David;: Yeah Taylor
19/06/2019, 17:39 - Rob;: I thought Lacey for a second
19/06/2019, 17:40 - Rob;: But that's something different
19/06/2019, 17:40 - Rob;: Sort of forced and repressed and military
19/06/2019, 17:40 - David;: Lacy too mild, not smug or punchable enough
19/06/2019, 17:41 - David;: Lacks the real abrasive jarring vibe
19/06/2019, 17:53 - Paul;: Gove would be one of those leather wearing dog gimps
19/06/2019, 17:54 - David;: Probably with a huge shit fetish as well
19/06/2019, 17:56 - Paul;: Always carries a funnel
19/06/2019, 18:10 - David;: Stewart ded
19/06/2019, 18:16 - Sam;: So it‚Äôs still all to play for then? As boris has less than half the votes.
19/06/2019, 18:35 - / James Ball: Hunt? Gove?
19/06/2019, 18:38 - David;: No thanks
19/06/2019, 18:39 - Jack G;: NEXT
19/06/2019, 18:42 - Sam;: Javid would be manageable.after that, it‚Äôs the choice between a bullet to the head (boris), a punch in the face (Hunt) or a flying kick to the bollock (Gove).
19/06/2019, 18:43 - David;: I think now we just take Boris in the hope he brings the house down with him
19/06/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt be dealing with Javid egg bat though
19/06/2019, 18:47 - David;: A bat and a gimp and a cunt and a toff and a bucket of vindaloo
19/06/2019, 18:47 - David;: Bucket!
19/06/2019, 18:53 - David;: We're Tories
We're going to score no deal for you

19/06/2019, 20:36 - David;: Not a pair among them
19/06/2019, 20:36 - David;: It's a closed system.
19/06/2019, 20:57 - / James Ball: Stuck in the machine?

19/06/2019, 22:07 - Phill: Most of the dints on love island are 20-23. Would fuck them all.
19/06/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: That rule is actually getting obstructive now. Was a time when it just made sure you wernt an actual peado
20/06/2019, 08:28 - Damian Rumble: Imagine.... In 5 to10 years HBO or someone else are going to make 'Brexit' into a big budget political drama with loads of sex, drugs and betrayals... I mean literally all the ingredients are there.
20/06/2019, 08:35 - Rob;: If the sex is there I'm not sure I want to see
20/06/2019, 09:00 - / James Ball: But if they adapted the story so it was actually set in southern California and everyone played by 20 somethings
20/06/2019, 09:05 - / James Ball: A touching scene where Michel barnier comes back up the beach from surfing and has an intimate moment with a young Angela Merkel in her cadillac overlooking the sunset. A little tet√™-√†-tet√™ because their friend Terri May really does want to leave the surf club :(
20/06/2019, 09:20 - Damian Rumble: Boris would be a great character. Constantly blathering about in the background of the early series causing problems by sleeping with peoples wives and shameless plotting ineffectively before becoming one of the main protagonists in a later series
20/06/2019, 09:23 - Rob;: Party boy journalist Mitch Gove
20/06/2019, 09:24 - Rob;: Doing coke off his surfboard as he files copy for the Santa Monica Chronicle

20/06/2019, 09:48 - Phill: The kid who is not allowed in the surf club because he's a dweeb Jake Mogg
20/06/2019, 09:53 - Phill: Angie was sitting on Michaels board as Jake stepped into the beach hut cafe.
"What do you want Jake?" Groaned Angie. 
"I want access to the beach hut but don't want to be a member of the surf club." Said Jake, peering over his faded Oakley sunglasses. He approached Angie, his pale, hands resting in the pockets of his Hi-Tec swim shorts. He leaned in to her and hissed coldly into her ear "I'm taking the surf club down".

20/06/2019, 22:04 - Phill: Someone at work today was telling a story about how he thinks his dog is gay
20/06/2019, 22:04 - David;: Great story
20/06/2019, 22:06 - Phill: He said he has another dog and when his sister bring round her female dog his straight dog goes straight in for the hump and his gay dog just looks really disgusted
20/06/2019, 22:07 - Phill: This guy's nickname is Rutter
20/06/2019, 22:08 - Phill: Sits quietly for most of the day getting on with work not saying much but then comes out with shit like gay dogs and the time his wife tried to stick her dildo up his arse
20/06/2019, 22:10 - David;: Lol, rutter

21/06/2019, 21:28 - David;: Yeah embarassing. To be fair he should end it rather than string her along
21/06/2019, 21:28 - David;: Clear he fancies new dint
21/06/2019, 21:29 - Phill: Amy such a cunt. Her and Curtis won't last. She's a nazi.

21/06/2019, 21:30 - David;: Deep strategy

24/06/2019, 14:48 - Phill: Easily worth that no?
24/06/2019, 14:48 - Phill: Normal sight for ¬£300 sounds like a bargain

24/06/2019, 14:48 - David;: A distraction
24/06/2019, 14:49 - Rob;: It would be shit if you got them, then hated all of your clothes, the decor of your flat, the sight of your family
24/06/2019, 14:50 - David;: Or through some adjustment and adaptation effect everything resembled shit
24/06/2019, 14:50 - David;: Too much risk

24/06/2019, 21:21 - Phill: Yeah massive error on his part. Not defending it. But she's raw Gypsy.
24/06/2019, 21:21 - Sam;: One of my favourite fuck ups in a long time. Basically staring the gusset in the eye then just decide to call her slag in ear shot.

25/06/2019, 10:13 - Rob;: That's excellent
25/06/2019, 10:15 - Rob;: Our estate agents tried to charge us a ¬£200 renewal fee one day before it became illegal to charge those fees to tenants
25/06/2019, 10:17 - David;: The estate agent I just used refused to explain to me how the first rent had been calculated - all she would say is 'the figure is correct'. Had to work it out through a process of deduction.
25/06/2019, 10:21 - David;: They are delightful
25/06/2019, 11:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Love the response, hope you sent this

25/06/2019, 11:31 - David;: Parasitea
25/06/2019, 11:31 - / James Ball: But Dave, who else will print out the poorly formatted and wrong document from word and charge you ¬£200 for the privilege
25/06/2019, 11:33 - David;: Hamish has a good story where they brought zoopla print-outs as their 'valuation'
25/06/2019, 11:34 - David;: Cheers mate, you've saved me 30 seconds on google
25/06/2019, 11:35 - David;: Damian they need disrupting. Why are you spending your time ruining democracy and human relationships rather than fucking over estate agents?
25/06/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: They've done a good job of stoking fear of what happens when you cut them out I reckon
25/06/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: They offer a better service and more protection to landlords than they do to tenants, and it's landlords who would decide whether to use them
25/06/2019, 11:50 - David;: Yea but all that easy to solve. E.g. a deposit holding platform, some sort of tenancy vetting and matching platform
25/06/2019, 11:51 - David;: And they would reduce fees for landlords
25/06/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: Yeah, would certainly be better
25/06/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: I think they've just spun such a good web of lies about the risk of squatters etc
25/06/2019, 11:52 - David;: Lol but how are they specifically stopping that?
25/06/2019, 11:52 - David;: That's more the law/police.
25/06/2019, 11:53 - David;: They don't handle evictions personally
25/06/2019, 11:54 - Rob;: But better on paper at sorting out a legally tight contract, and being able to initiate that process
25/06/2019, 11:54 - Rob;: I agree they're total shit wankers
25/06/2019, 11:57 - David;: Except they don't they use standard templates.
25/06/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: But also see why landlords don't mind them organising all the shit for them
25/06/2019, 11:58 - David;: I've rented out my flat without agents and the government provides a template lease contract. It's so easy to do.
25/06/2019, 11:58 - Rob;: But does old Maureen know that, David?
25/06/2019, 12:51 - David;: Lampard at Chelsea could be hillarious

25/06/2019, 12:52 - David;: 1 seasons experience in the championship
25/06/2019, 13:09 - Paul;: Just used an estate agent. Just pay them a 1 month rent finders fee then they do all the background checks and previous references

25/06/2019, 13:13 - David;: So you're paying around a grand for someone to email 2 referees and do a standardised credit check. Value.
25/06/2019, 13:13 - David;: Just ask them direct for referee details and proof of income/bank statements. That's all they collect.
25/06/2019, 13:16 - Paul;: I have too much fear of not using an estate agent
25/06/2019, 13:16 - Paul;: The squatters
25/06/2019, 13:20 - David;: They've got you
25/06/2019, 13:21 - Paul;: Also they do have easy contact with people wanting to move in straight away
25/06/2019, 13:21 - David;: Looked up 'daylight robbery' I the dictionary - there was just a picture of Paul transferring a month's worth of rent to his estate agent for 20 mins work.
25/06/2019, 13:22 - David;: As does spareroom.com
25/06/2019, 13:24 - Paul;: Would use again
25/06/2019, 13:24 - David;: Would suck cock for tennants
25/06/2019, 13:24 - Paul;: Lol
25/06/2019, 17:24 - Damian Rumble: Not entirely sure why I am ruining democracy or why it's my responsibility to be fucking over estate agents.
25/06/2019, 17:26 - Damian Rumble: Our one let us an empty property with multiple promises that it would be fully furnished. Then it turned out fully furnished meant beds only we put up a right fuss and got ¬£100 out of them and a note that said "take it up with the landlord this ain't our problem". Good to know that admin fee was going to something useful...

25/06/2019, 21:54 - David;: I'm sorry sir but this was quite clearly written in Mayan astrological cycles
25/06/2019, 21:54 - Stefan;: Maybe Tesco created a relish that will actually last until 20140 AD
25/06/2019, 21:55 - Rob;: They tell you when a product is on offer by saying 'it's from two days into week commencing week 37 to end of week 41'
25/06/2019, 21:55 - Rob;: Does not correspond to weeks of the year, nor weeks of the financial year

25/06/2019, 21:59 - David;: What's it's baseline?
25/06/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: We don't know
25/06/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: We have a conversation chart on the wall
25/06/2019, 22:03 - Paul;: But week 1 isn‚Äôt from first week of the year?
25/06/2019, 22:06 - David;: Too obvious
25/06/2019, 22:06 - David;: So you're not allowed to know?
25/06/2019, 22:06 - David;: It's like Scientology when you reach level 8 you learn the week system.
25/06/2019, 22:07 - David;: Lol basing it to the Julian calender. Can't get over that. No note or anything - should just be obvious.

03/07/2019, 23:57 - Damian Rumble: Quote of the weekend... "If Glastonbury has taught me anything about myself it's that I can store a disproportionate amount of piss within my body. In one sitting I managed to fill up an entire 750ml bottle and a 500ml bottle as well" - @447752458076

04/07/2019, 21:39 - David;: Yeah, why is no one pointing out she did exactly the same thing
04/07/2019, 21:45 - David;: Also why Curtis is humoring all Amy's bullshit

07/07/2019, 17:37 - David;: Ruining football
07/07/2019, 17:37 - Hamish Sinclair: ?
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Just that decision in the women's world cup - but more generally everything is a peno now
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Everything is offside
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Can't celebrate goals when they happen so no drama
07/07/2019, 17:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Its fucking with everyone's sense of what's a goal or not
07/07/2019, 17:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Cant celebrate
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Yeah. Kills it as a spectacle
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Fans don't know what's happening
07/07/2019, 17:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Arbitrary marginal offside aswell
07/07/2019, 17:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Morally onside
07/07/2019, 17:40 - Hamish Sinclair: They should make offside easier for attackers. Make it so that that any overlap between players equals onsode
07/07/2019, 17:40 - David;: They made a good point in guardian weekly that they are not paying same attention to when ball is struck to where striker is. One frame can make a difference, and when is the 'pass' played? Wasn't meant to be this precise.
07/07/2019, 17:41 - David;: Yeah
07/07/2019, 17:41 - David;: Because also offside is designed to prevent goal hanging not to give huge advantage to defenders
07/07/2019, 17:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Would probably stop any side from playing a high line ever though
07/07/2019, 17:42 - David;: Makes the offside trap too easy to play now it's refereed like this
07/07/2019, 17:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, now just punishes clever movement
07/07/2019, 17:43 - Hamish Sinclair: VAR would have ruined the career of fox in the box types - inzaghi, solskjaer etc
07/07/2019, 17:43 - David;: Also this thing of any handball in the box no matter how close or inadvertant or close to the body is a penno
07/07/2019, 17:44 - David;: Maybe need a form of punishment less severe like an indirect free kick in the box
07/07/2019, 17:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Differentiate between accidental and not
07/07/2019, 17:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah that would work, indirect freekick would still be dangerous but not on ssme level as a pen
07/07/2019, 17:46 - David;: Also I think there should be something like a challenge system for checking, because seems arbitrary when refs do or do not consult it
07/07/2019, 17:46 - David;: And to keep checks to a mimimum
07/07/2019, 17:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, stops all decisions around the box being subject to such intense scrutiny
07/07/2019, 17:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Although teams would always just throw in a challenge whenever you concede a goal, and then how far back do you go?
07/07/2019, 17:49 - David;: Otherwise basically every corner we need to stop and run over and review footage for any holding, shirt pulling, blocking etc.
07/07/2019, 17:49 - David;: Have to say what you think was wrong
07/07/2019, 17:49 - David;: I.e. 'im challenging - number 7 was offside'
07/07/2019, 17:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Or the ref has to initiate the decision to go to VAR, therefore allowing people to get away with low levels of holding etc
07/07/2019, 17:57 - David;: Going to be a lot more set piece goals this season I guess
07/07/2019, 17:57 - David;: Because defenders will be scared of being to physical so will be easier to find space in the box
07/07/2019, 17:57 - David;: Maybe this is what triggers the return of 4-4-2
07/07/2019, 17:58 - David;: Would be somewhat ironic
07/07/2019, 17:58 - David;: Sends us back to the dark ages
07/07/2019, 17:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Both teams just humping it into the box, rolling the VAR dice
07/07/2019, 17:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Would probably improve English chances in Europe though, play to our steghtnhs
07/07/2019, 18:00 - David;: Although just as we've all abandoned that style of football
07/07/2019, 18:00 - David;: It will somehow work against us
07/07/2019, 21:20 - Damian Rumble: I think part of the problem is that the very culture of football is about pushing the rules to absolute limit and beyond when ever you can. The current rules are very hard to enforced to the letter by the refs in real time and because everyone is doing it a large number of offences are allowed to pass. VAR ends that by allowing proper scrutiny and the result is a very stop start game where players who are routinely cheating are getting caught when previously they wouldn't have. I think the rules need to change to reflect this but so does the culture of football - the accidental handball in the penalty area is a good example of this. At the end of the day playing competitively and fairly without gamesmanship is preferable to old way that drives an 'do anything to win' attitude and fuels widespread disdain for the officials.
07/07/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: Not true of all offensives though. Offsides are as hard to judge as a player as by a ref, you're not cheating by being offside
07/07/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: Handballs too, very rare for them to be really clearcut and deliberate
07/07/2019, 21:27 - Rob;: Diving's probably the only thing, and that doesn't seem to have actually come up that much in var matches
07/07/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Can everyone do me a favour and delete that video of me?
07/07/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
07/07/2019, 22:20 - Stefan;: Yep

07/07/2019, 22:29 - David;: He could have just had a really big curry in that one
07/07/2019, 22:30 - Rob;: I got big curried at Glasto
07/07/2019, 22:31 - Rob;: Reduced my mdma trip to 10 mild minutes spent walking through a crowd, about two hours late
07/07/2019, 22:35 - David;: So this is an established effect
07/07/2019, 22:59 - Rob;: It was actually a pie, but Damo and I came to call it the big curry
07/07/2019, 23:43 - Damian Rumble: Yeah. Smashed some before chemical brothers and felt nothing for the whole set. Obviously I then topped up and I was thoroughly blooted when things finally caught up
07/07/2019, 23:45 - Stefan;: The physics is you need loads of drugs to break through the wall of curry, but when the damn finally breaks it hits all at once

11/07/2019, 11:45 - David;: That's always useful

These were the sorts of insights that didn't seem to be coming from other elite players. The fact that former Spurs full-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto would turn up for every match with a Tesco bag containing the same four luncheon items: a croissant, a hot chocolate, a full-fat Coke and a packet of crisps. That Alberto Moreno has a tattoo of chimp wearing glasses and Beats By Dre headphones and holding a gun.

"My first love was really intense. I was 19. He was 40 with a wife and kids. I remember he came to visit me in the shop I was working in. We were chatting when this random person came in and dropped a black bin bag on the counter. He said, "guys this is a bag of coke. I want you to keep. I'm in a lot of trouble with the police and I need to flee the country.". Well obviously we kept it. We talked about being responsible with it but we ended up getting out at all occasions. I hosted big parties. Snorting it all the time. Sucking it off his cock. It was really bad. We got into alot of arguements during that time. Like, physical fighting. I can't believe how violent I was back then! Anyway, he got into some issues with child support and had to move back in with his wife. He still messages from time to time. I should go see him again at some point... "

24/07/2019, 07:23 - Rob;: Two separate dreams about Sam last night
24/07/2019, 07:25 - Rob;: 1st one, we're in a remote Wales-like cottage and he pisses in an enormous fruit bowl, right to the top, then proceeds to eat all the piss-sodden bananas
24/07/2019, 07:27 - Rob;: 2nd, we find him asleep in a BMW in Chippy, wearing a suit, but almost fully submerged in liquid shit
24/07/2019, 07:27 - Rob;: That's what my subconscious gives me

24/07/2019, 10:18 - Paul;: A build at work?
24/07/2019, 10:19 - Rob;: Build means a client's change to a page to our new account manager apparently
24/07/2019, 10:24 - Sam;: lol. action the build - we have to use this phrase anytime we need some droogs preparing in wales.
24/07/2019, 10:25 - Rob;: Another one we get a lot is 'learnings'
24/07/2019, 10:25 - Rob;: What learnings can we take from this
24/07/2019, 10:26 - Sam;: and how can we action those learnings in the next build?
24/07/2019, 10:28 - Rob;: We're a hilarious company half made of journalists and designers, and half marketeers who go on about how simple, direct and effective the communication services we provide are, in the least simple and direct language possible
24/07/2019, 11:59 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
24/07/2019, 11:59 - Sam;: Matt Miazga
24/07/2019, 12:00 - Rob;: Didn't this happen last season?
24/07/2019, 12:03 - Sam;: Yeah. Just doing a throwback now he‚Äôs transferred to reading
24/07/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: 10 players for the price of one

24/07/2019, 22:09 - Rob;: Is that good? Possibly fairly administrative
24/07/2019, 22:10 - Phill: Best position imo. Potential to troll is massive plus get to yell order
24/07/2019, 22:11 - Phill: Dayumm speaker and leader not the same
24/07/2019, 22:14 - Rob;: Yeah they have to be elected by parliament

25/07/2019, 08:45 - Stefan;: New record
25/07/2019, 12:48 - / James Ball: 36 degrees in rural Mitcheldean today. How is the urban heat island in London? Sticky and polluted?
25/07/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Very, very air conditioned in my office, I'm actually chilly. Will report on the Mad Max future outside in a bit
25/07/2019, 12:54 - Stefan;: I'm up in Birkenhead for a court hearing - a cool 30 degrees here
25/07/2019, 12:55 - Stefan;: Sphincter clenched in anticipation of returning to 39 degrees London this afternoon
25/07/2019, 13:12 - / James Ball: Train ride back to London? That'll be fun in this heat
25/07/2019, 13:13 - David;: Just heard someone use 'close' in it's proper context. I'd forgotten it had an actual meaning and that normal people don't apply it arbitrarily to anything
25/07/2019, 13:13 - David;: It is a very close day
25/07/2019, 13:15 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm on the underground melting
25/07/2019, 13:17 - David;: The Johnson purge adds to the post-apocalyptic vibe as well
25/07/2019, 13:21 - Stefan;: The Merseyrail underground is deliciously cold. Might just ride the loop all day
25/07/2019, 13:23 - Rob;: Being near a busy road for a minute was horrible, but in the park it basically feels like you're in Milan
25/07/2019, 13:27 - / James Ball: Don't worry there's a golden age coming apparently. You know, akin to the rennaisance or the enlightenment or something.
25/07/2019, 14:08 - Damian Rumble: We have our office sports day today. Many people not happy about being forced to go outside and do exercise. The company declared an 'extreme weather event' and allowed alot of people to work from home
25/07/2019, 14:10 - Paul;: >extreme weather event
25/07/2019, 14:11 - Damian Rumble: A very justified use of >

25/07/2019, 15:37 - / James Ball: Would be useful to have a horse leg
25/07/2019, 15:37 - / James Ball: Just for special occasions
25/07/2019, 15:42 - Rob;: Glad they clarified (bird)
25/07/2019, 15:43 - Rob;: Horse would be good for ballet I reckon
25/07/2019, 15:43 - Stefan;: How great would shoes be if we all had horse or flamingo legs
25/07/2019, 15:44 - Rob;: I would hate to just one different leg as per the diagram

25/07/2019, 18:13 - Rob;: Huge plans
25/07/2019, 18:21 - Sam;: Massive. Please pass on my view that it should be done. I think that will sway things a lot
25/07/2019, 18:27 - Phill: Lol that document is classic consultancy.
25/07/2019, 18:27 - Phill: Not your average Zoopla search
25/07/2019, 18:32 - / James Ball: Sauna in the barn
25/07/2019, 18:32 - / James Ball: That'll get grotty
25/07/2019, 18:33 - Phill: Not a fan of the interior changes. Too dramatic. Too modern.
25/07/2019, 18:34 - Phill: Beccas first reaction: "oh no"
25/07/2019, 18:34 - Phill: Sauna and plunge pool great idea tho
25/07/2019, 19:14 - David;: Yeah I'm pushing so hard for the Sauna room
25/07/2019, 19:17 - Phill: Yeah the sauna room would be GOAT
25/07/2019, 19:17 - Sam;: Making cabin style beds above the living room looks great. The frousting potential on having a wooden borrow to grot down into when I‚Äôm off my nut
25/07/2019, 19:34 - Paul;: Agree on this
25/07/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: Yeah the interior doesn't need too much. Running water (assume that's happening to supply sauna) would make a world of difference
25/07/2019, 19:38 - Phill: This already exists. No change needed. Boycott the change.
25/07/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: Should level the site and tarmac it. Build multi-storey parking at the top
25/07/2019, 19:47 - Sam;: It doesn‚Äôt already exist. There‚Äôs a couple of mattresses on the floor and a couple of unnecessarily raised single beds. That room could be a glorious froust chamber. Glorious
25/07/2019, 19:53 - Rob;: Making sound carry less between the attic and the living room would be big
25/07/2019, 19:58 - Paul;: Fake news
25/07/2019, 20:04 - Phill: No. Part of the grot is being able to hear people trippinf whilst blooted. Keeps you tethered.
25/07/2019, 20:05 - Paul;: You should have a vomitorium in the barn
25/07/2019, 20:05 - Paul;: Create maximum grot
25/07/2019, 20:11 - Paul;: Remember, if you want your k. Tomorrow you should pay
25/07/2019, 20:11 - Phill: Got no money. Haven't been paid.
25/07/2019, 20:11 - Phill: Get paid weds next week.
25/07/2019, 20:12 - Phill: >MOT 4 new tyres.

25/07/2019, 22:14 - Phill: Condoms come in all different flavours now. Like strawberry and curry. You like curry?
25/07/2019, 22:15 - Phill: Who's used all the peniccilin?
25/07/2019, 22:16 - Phill: Mark sir. He's got nob rot off some tart.
25/07/2019, 22:44 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
26/07/2019, 08:45 - Damian Rumble: That document is ridiculous. But the plans are great. Good to build the 'loo with a view' and to knock through the wall to make a much larger kitchen area
26/07/2019, 08:46 - Damian Rumble: Complete by June 2020? Best get something booked in for after that I reckon
26/07/2019, 09:43 - Rob;: Yeah, immediately after the proposed date. There's no chance of delay
26/07/2019, 10:32 - David;: Here here
26/07/2019, 10:55 - David;: Re-watching Bernards watch with my nephew
26/07/2019, 10:56 - David;: >90s BBC production values
26/07/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: Very jealous
26/07/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: Feel like Bernard never really explored the try potential of the watch
26/07/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: True"
26/07/2019, 10:57 - David;: No, he's always using it to solve low-key problems. Being late to a party etc.
26/07/2019, 10:58 - David;: Also been watching aquilla. Would be good to find a spaceship.
26/07/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: I loved that show

26/07/2019, 14:28 - Damian Rumble: We have those for free in our office
26/07/2019, 14:45 - David;: Gulag rations. 1 club orange and a bowl of gruel.

26/07/2019, 20:45 - David;: How has he ended up that low yet perfectly horizontal?
26/07/2019, 20:47 - Sam;: That‚Äôs the Jones mechanism
26/07/2019, 20:48 - Sam;: A way of tackling that pays no heed to dignity
26/07/2019, 20:51 - David;: You can't sell that. Build the team around it
26/07/2019, 23:25 - Rob;: The visible pain has really got me
27/07/2019, 08:38 - Sam;: Um hello? Atletico 7 - 3 Real Madrid

27/07/2019, 11:07 - Jack G;: Well that‚Äôs out of absolutely no where
27/07/2019, 13:58 - David;: Me and Paul went to Tonyball yesterday. Hobbesy Stiles still going. He clatters into a youngster, elbows first. Paul hears him growl 'let the dog see the rabbit'.
27/07/2019, 18:15 - David;: Calvados and tonic
27/07/2019, 18:15 - David;: GOAT
28/07/2019, 10:02 - David;: BBC News - 'Mass brawl' breaks out on P&O cruise ship Britannia

28/07/2019, 10:06 - David;: He said one witness "explained to staff that things kicked off when another passenger appeared dressed as a clown. This upset one of their party because they'd specifically booked a cruise with no fancy dress. It led to a violent confrontation."
28/07/2019, 11:08 - / James Ball: I saw that. Imagine building a floating gin palace and filling it with drunk retirees and being surprised when things kick off

31/07/2019, 16:45 - Phill: Even better that it was held at Hotel Football, Old Trafford
31/07/2019, 16:49 - Rob;: I like his 'you've taken it out of context' argument
31/07/2019, 16:49 - Rob;: Your Honour you had to be there, they really were gagging for it

31/07/2019, 21:34 - David;: Dat sauce infrastructure
31/07/2019, 21:35 - Phill: Olive. Extra virgin olive. Red wine vinegar. Old wine. Soy. Balsamic.
31/07/2019, 21:36 - David;: 4/6
31/07/2019, 21:36 - Phill: Fish?
31/07/2019, 21:37 - David;: Missed out Lea and perrins. A left field decanting choice but had one spare
31/07/2019, 21:37 - David;: And sesame oil instead of the red wine
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: I like the idea of having good liquid infrastructure, but most of those things do already come in bottles of that size
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: What's decanting gaining here?
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Sam;: Those tops though. Such pour control
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: Yeah, like that
31/07/2019, 21:41 - Phill: Keith.
31/07/2019, 21:41 - Rob;: I'll agree for oils
31/07/2019, 21:41 - Rob;: Lea and Perrin's no needing to be poured any faster than it's original bottle dispenses it
31/07/2019, 21:44 - Phill: If you store it in those bottles it provides low level oxidisation which mellows the flavour but reduces shelf. Better for subtle flavouring of dishes opposed to the intense vinegaryness.
31/07/2019, 21:44 - Phill: Shelf life.
31/07/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: I see
31/07/2019, 21:46 - Paul;: Dave, can you confirm how fast this causes your l&p to pour?
31/07/2019, 22:02 - David;: It provides a smoother pour
31/07/2019, 22:02 - David;: Never been a fan of the pour speed of the native lea and perrins bottle
31/07/2019, 22:04 - David;: Plus the clean aesthetics
31/07/2019, 22:06 - David;: No labels. Just pure liquid.
31/07/2019, 22:07 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. Cutting down on branding in the home
31/07/2019, 22:11 - David;: When I have lea and perrins, I have loads of lea and perrins.
31/07/2019, 22:11 - Paul;: Pea and lerrins

31/07/2019, 22:18 - David;: Ah yeah, need that
31/07/2019, 22:19 - David;: I'm rinsing the L&P these days. Tomato juice.
31/07/2019, 22:20 - David;: Plus a staple for chillis to add sweetness.
31/07/2019, 22:21 - Paul;: Break out a chilli in wales. Want to try the ones you‚Äôve been making
31/07/2019, 22:21 - Paul;: Could have a few different batches
31/07/2019, 22:21 - Paul;: Different heats
31/07/2019, 22:21 - David;: I've refined it now. Impssible to improve.
31/07/2019, 22:22 - David;: But not sure ByC will be capable of recreating it.

31/07/2019, 23:27 - David;: Gagging to be hit. Zero threat
31/07/2019, 23:27 - David;: Maybe that's how it works. Creates complacency
01/08/2019, 07:43 - Rob;: You could use him when you've set a huge run target and the other team are just digging in trying not to get out
01/08/2019, 07:44 - Paul;: Equally you could use someone good
01/08/2019, 07:44 - Rob;: Let them have their sixes and catch them out

01/08/2019, 13:12 - / James Ball: Could be, sensual hotdog know no bounds.
01/08/2019, 13:15 - Rob;: The tail/penis is worrying
01/08/2019, 14:21 - David;: Bowling
01/08/2019, 15:13 - / James Ball: 129-8 is an impressively bad opener from them
01/08/2019, 15:14 - / James Ball: Still plenty of time for England to collapse in a very traditional way
01/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Yeah yeah, we  can easily fuck this up.
01/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Hubris. Predicting a sub-100 score for us
01/08/2019, 15:48 - Jack G;: Australia to sneak up to 200, we‚Äôll be 70-4 by lunch tomorrow
01/08/2019, 15:55 - David;: This is classic. A big 9th wicket partnership
01/08/2019, 15:59 - Jack G;: Very Ashton Agar

01/08/2019, 16:21 - David;: Inter Miami. Very shit.
01/08/2019, 16:41 - Sam;: Like he‚Äôs just creating his own fifa team to play with
01/08/2019, 16:47 - David;: Is the inter still short for the Italian word, or do they think that it's a generic team name like albion or athletic?
01/08/2019, 16:50 - Sam;: That‚Äôs my assumption too. It‚Äôs sound fancy therefore it‚Äôs fine. Inter Milan have it mate
01/08/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Miami Caledonian Thistle
01/08/2019, 16:54 - David;: Bayern Miami
01/08/2019, 16:57 - / James Ball: Bourissa Inter Miami Thistle City United
01/08/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Bayer Leverkusen will always get me, that there's a brand that sponsors a foorball team that has an almost identical name to another football team's name
01/08/2019, 16:58 - Rob;: Like having Wigan Athleti, with Athleti being a tyre company
01/08/2019, 16:58 - David;: Would be good if Beckham had used Bayer  without getting any sponsorship from them
01/08/2019, 16:59 - David;: Just thought it was a sophisticated word. Bayer Miami. No financial relationship between them
01/08/2019, 17:00 - / James Ball: Bayer literally means Bavarian in german
01/08/2019, 17:01 - / James Ball: The Bavarian Miami
01/08/2019, 17:01 - / James Ball: Huge sizzling bratwursts on the beach
01/08/2019, 17:01 - David;: Red Bull Miami. 'I assumed from red bull Saltzburg that red bull was a German term for football team'
01/08/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: But the name in this case comes from the pharmaceutical company based in Leverkusen
01/08/2019, 17:02 - David;: but is the company itself named after the place?
01/08/2019, 17:02 - / James Ball: Bayerin would be a female Bavarian
01/08/2019, 17:03 - David;: What's the difference Bayer vs Bayern then?
01/08/2019, 17:03 - / James Ball: Bayern means Bavaria
01/08/2019, 17:03 - David;: Yeah but Bayer
01/08/2019, 17:04 - / James Ball: Ich bin Bayer ich komme aus Bayern. Ich spiele immer Fu√üball.
01/08/2019, 17:05 - Rob;: Bayer = Bavarian
Bayern = Bavaria
01/08/2019, 17:05 - Rob;: So it's not really a coincidence
01/08/2019, 17:06 - Rob;: Bayer tradmarked the word heroin
01/08/2019, 17:07 - David;: CSKA Miami
01/08/2019, 17:08 - Rob;: Best know product, aspirin, the active ingredient of which was discovered by Edward Stone as he chewed on some willow bark in a meadow just outside of Chipping Norton
01/08/2019, 17:10 - / James Ball: Salaclyic acid
01/08/2019, 18:03 - David;: And that's cruffts
01/08/2019, 18:04 - Jack G;: Shocking umpiring today
01/08/2019, 18:14 - Jack G;: Rob, how is your Pepe?
01/08/2019, 18:23 - David;: What does that even mean?
01/08/2019, 18:24 - Jack G;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49197553
01/08/2019, 18:24 - David;: How is your pepe?
01/08/2019, 18:24 - Rob;: Yeah, the phrasing there is hard to penetrate
01/08/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: I am very happy to have signed a wide player, and a very good one at that
01/08/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: Wide attack being the best form of defence of course
01/08/2019, 18:25 - David;: Yeah because your problem has always been a lack of mercurial forwards
01/08/2019, 18:26 - Rob;: But width, in desperate need of width
01/08/2019, 18:26 - David;: Feel you could have a season like our early Klopp years
01/08/2019, 18:26 - David;: Madcap 4-4s everywhere
01/08/2019, 18:27 - Rob;: We really need the Klopp season where we sign Virgil van Dyke
01/08/2019, 18:27 - David;: You have to earn that Rob
01/08/2019, 18:27 - Jack G;: A more direct winger would definitely help your away form though, which is your main issue
01/08/2019, 18:28 - David;: You have to endure a season of conceding at every corner and Karius spilling 50% of shots
01/08/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Perhaps Saliba next season will be our defensive panacea
01/08/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Good to pin huge hopes on that
01/08/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: If we ship out Mustafi and get a good centre half in this week, and maybe Tierney too, I'll be happy
01/08/2019, 18:29 - David;: Is Koscielny just dead to Emery now
01/08/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Emery said he'd play him if he wants to stay
01/08/2019, 18:30 - David;: Good to base your defence on a disgruntled veteran and a 19 year old
01/08/2019, 18:30 - Rob;: He's going, pretty sure
01/08/2019, 18:32 - Rob;: Leaves Sokratis (fine), Holding (Good, but returning from big injury), Mustafi (human chaos), Chambers (who knows at this point) and Monreal (good, but old and needed at LB unless Tierney comes)
01/08/2019, 18:32 - Rob;: Which is not terribly convincing at all
01/08/2019, 18:56 - Paul;: How‚Äôs your Pepe
01/08/2019, 19:34 - David;: We're you thinking how's your day. Like 'hope you have a great Pepe'
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Jack G;: How‚Äôs your father, how‚Äôs your Pepe
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: How's your father?
How's your papa?
How's your Pepe?
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: Haha
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Jack G;: Lol
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: Got it!
01/08/2019, 19:37 - Rob;: Jack you've got to admit it's a leap
01/08/2019, 19:38 - Jack G;: I thought Pepe had language connotations to father
01/08/2019, 19:39 - Jack G;: Made sense in my head, oh well probably a 4/10 ‚Äúpun‚Äù will try harder
01/08/2019, 19:40 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/08/2019, 19:40 - Rob;: Lol
01/08/2019, 19:41 - Rob;: Ah yeah, Pepe, as in pater putativus
01/08/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: This dam wall collapsing then
01/08/2019, 19:59 - David;: Lol
01/08/2019, 19:59 - David;: Alpha Pepe
01/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: Obviously
01/08/2019, 20:02 - Rob;: Stay
01/08/2019, 20:14 - Jack G;: Ah not far from me, could be disaster
01/08/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: Turns the tap on in your 8th floor flat and gets swept away
01/08/2019, 20:16 - Jack G;: Could send a load of water down the Mersey river, would write off Stockport for a bit
01/08/2019, 20:16 - David;: Do we need Stockport?
01/08/2019, 20:17 - Jack G;: Any train coming from south into Manchester goes through Stockport
01/08/2019, 20:17 - Jack G;: But Stockport itself, not much of a loss
01/08/2019, 20:28 - Rob;: It's it only only to flood Whalley Bridge though?
01/08/2019, 20:28 - Rob;: Which is a bit smaller than Chippy
01/08/2019, 20:29 - Jack G;: Depends if the dam fails or not
01/08/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/08/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: Could swim that
01/08/2019, 20:37 - Jack G;: Hopefully stays that way, getting loads of warnings
01/08/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: Ride the wave down
01/08/2019, 20:39 - Jack G;: This time last year we had no rain for a month and wildfires on Saddleworth Moor
01/08/2019, 20:44 - David;: How have you moved to the one place in the country undergoing a biblical apocalypse?
01/08/2019, 20:45 - David;: 'we had a terrible locust plague in Salford a few weeks back'
01/08/2019, 20:46 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm far enough away to not be effected, can just watch the fallout.
01/08/2019, 20:48 - David;: How psyched are you for the Northern powerhouse?
01/08/2019, 20:51 - Jack G;: Doubt much will change - what will reducing journey time from Manchester to Leeds really do? Need the jobs not the trains
01/08/2019, 20:57 - Paul;: Lol
01/08/2019, 20:58 - Rob;: Might be nice for Leeds though
01/08/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: And opens up those new channel 4 jobs to Manchester, which won't be new any more by the time the trains are running
01/08/2019, 20:59 - Phill: Train drivers.

01/08/2019, 22:20 - / James Ball: And the bottom one has his head deep in a jar of fanny
02/08/2019, 07:05 - Rob;: 14% swing from Conservative to Lib Dem in Brecon & Radnorshire
02/08/2019, 07:07 - Rob;: Well, votes might have come from Labour and elsewhere, but they made up 9,500 votes in a constituency of less than 70k. That's quite a big swing
02/08/2019, 07:08 - Jack G;: Boris now with a majority of 1
02/08/2019, 07:08 - Rob;: Yeah
02/08/2019, 07:08 - Rob;: Which includes all the people he just sacked
02/08/2019, 08:02 - Stefan;: I think most of the LibDem gains are from Labour and most of the Tories' losses were to Brexit party
02/08/2019, 08:03 - Stefan;: Also the margin was 1,400 - they probably wouldn't have won if the Greens and Plaid Cymru hadn't stepped aside
02/08/2019, 08:06 - Damian Rumble: A great result but I think we might lose that if there was a GE tomorrow. If the brexit party step aside then the Tories would have won for sure
02/08/2019, 08:07 - Damian Rumble: Still one defection/abstention away from defeating the Tories
02/08/2019, 08:08 - Damian Rumble: That's all us and none of labour
02/08/2019, 08:11 - Hamish Sinclair: That slightly overlooks labour's result at the last election
02/08/2019, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Labour being the reason there was a hing parliament in the first place
02/08/2019, 08:15 - Rob;: Also, depending on what the votes on, can you count on labour voting against the Tories?
02/08/2019, 08:57 - Sam;: A hing parliament, a hibbed parliament
02/08/2019, 10:20 - David;: You have 13 seats

02/08/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Where will Chelsea get their goals this season?
02/08/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: Only Giroud and Batshuyi classified as forwards on Fantasy
02/08/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: Unable to sign players
02/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Lol, what was he chairman of?
02/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Abraham as well?
02/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: They could probably convert Pedro and/or Willian to false 9s at a stretch
02/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: I'm just leaving Chelsea well alone until we have any info on Lampard's line up
02/08/2019, 12:17 - Rob;: Chelsea fan at works predicts Abraham and Giroud rotating
02/08/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: Yeah, I'm probably going to steer clear, but I do think they'll end up have good value players - no one in the squad costs more than 7.5
02/08/2019, 12:21 - David;: Agreed, just impossible to predict which until we have more data
02/08/2019, 12:21 - David;: I think Pulisic will be good but a he's adjusting to the prem and not sure he will start from day 1
02/08/2019, 12:23 - David;: Probs going to be something like front 3 of Pulisic, Giroud, Willian in front of Barkley, Kovacic, Jorginho? Or a mount/loftus-cheek thrown in there.
02/08/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: His Pulisic and assist man? His goal stats don't look so hot
02/08/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: Sounds plausible
02/08/2019, 12:24 - Rob;: Chelsea fan I spoke to is buying bonds in Barkley
02/08/2019, 12:24 - David;: I considered Barkley bonds.
02/08/2019, 12:25 - Rob;: I can actually upgrade my bench midfielder into him with the 1.5m I have spare, which seems logical
02/08/2019, 12:25 - David;: Does assists, but also been scoring in pre-season
02/08/2019, 12:26 - David;: Barkley's Premier League

02/08/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: The presence of the other two, and how Maguire is ignoring them are underrated contributions
02/08/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: But I think the biggest contribution is the main girl's initial basic attractiveness, which dissolves on close inspection
02/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: The unabashed body language big Maguire
02/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: That's what United have paid 80 million for
02/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: The post-anecdote timing
02/08/2019, 16:53 - Rob;: 9/10 meme

02/08/2019, 17:37 - Stefan;: Been there, it's incredible
02/08/2019, 17:37 - Stefan;: People base jump off it
02/08/2019, 18:08 - Jack G;: This crowd at Edgbaston is great
03/08/2019, 10:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Stefan are you coming to pride again this year?
03/08/2019, 10:17 - Stefan;: Yep, got the same house as last year
03/08/2019, 10:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Presume you're seeing kylie?
03/08/2019, 10:33 - Stefan;: That's a very safe presumption
03/08/2019, 23:01 - Sam;: If I opened a pub: The Postman‚Äôs Sack.
03/08/2019, 23:49 - David;: The miners shaft?
04/08/2019, 00:32 - Sam;: Yeah y
04/08/2019, 12:00 - David;: Moise to Everton
04/08/2019, 12:00 - David;: Hib
04/08/2019, 12:28 - Phill: That's a great signing for them.
04/08/2019, 15:50 - Sam;: Why are city not wearing any sponsorships on their shirt?
04/08/2019, 15:51 - David;: Because they are bell ends
05/08/2019, 10:46 - Paul;: Rob, have you bought the away shirt yet?
05/08/2019, 10:51 - Rob;: No
05/08/2019, 20:38 - Phill: All this cum over Maguire is embarrassing. He's a mid-tier defender at best.
05/08/2019, 21:24 - Jack G;: https://youtu.be/AnvHx4GWyvY
05/08/2019, 21:24 - Jack G;: Got to be better than that though
06/08/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: Sam how did your estate agent reply to you 'we asked for a month-to-month contract at the same price, is this a joke?' email?
06/08/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: Pops into my head every so often
06/08/2019, 13:58 - David;: Phil make an FF team, then Jules Chippet complete.
06/08/2019, 13:59 - Phill: Yeah will do this evening
06/08/2019, 13:59 - David;: Would also like closure on this
06/08/2019, 14:30 - David;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvelous_Nakamba
06/08/2019, 16:24 - Sam;: Lol. They admitted they shouldn‚Äôt have offered monthly rolling as the landlord was not on board with it.

I got a comprise of a break clause ‚ÄòWindow‚Äô of 2 months, which starts after 6 months.
07/08/2019, 12:37 - David;: Koscielny ded. Jenkinson ded.
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Sam;: David luiz to Arsenal?
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: Yeah
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: Possibly
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Jack G;: Elneny, Guendouzi, Luiz. I see a pattern
07/08/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: Feel like we're getting a tramp's boots to go with our brand new tuxedo jacket
07/08/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: Eleneny got a haircut actually
07/08/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: And will probably leave
07/08/2019, 17:39 - David;: Should get Fellaini as well
07/08/2019, 17:42 - Sam;: He‚Äôs also cut his hair...
07/08/2019, 17:55 - Jack G;: Surely Luiz is an upgrade on Mustafi though? Could do a job this season until Saliba comes in next season?
07/08/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: He's probably a shade better
07/08/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: It would have just been nice of we could have made centre half the priority this summer
07/08/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: Not doing so undermines good purchases elsewhere
07/08/2019, 17:58 - Jack G;: Sure but prices for CB are massively inflated atm so wouldn‚Äôt leave money for anything else. Surely next summer you can spend you‚Äôre whole budget on a great CB as you won‚Äôt have many holes left in the squad
07/08/2019, 17:59 - Paul;: Haven‚Äôt arsenal always been saying this and always have a terrible defence?
07/08/2019, 18:03 - David;: How's your pepe
07/08/2019, 18:11 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/08/2019, 18:20 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/08/2019, 18:31 - Paul;: 4th fc
07/08/2019, 18:35 - Phill: >tardigrades
07/08/2019, 18:43 - David;: Yeah >tardigrades
07/08/2019, 21:14 - Phill: Sambo both your teams have spent over ¬£100m
08/08/2019, 11:18 - David;: Lukaku ded
08/08/2019, 11:19 - Rob;: About to downgrade into ancient relic Mandzukic?
08/08/2019, 11:19 - Rob;: A crumbling old man
08/08/2019, 11:19 - David;: Headline just says inter though - didn't specify inter Milan or inter Miami
08/08/2019, 11:20 - David;: Makes no sense. I though their whole strategy was to stop buying aging husks.
08/08/2019, 11:21 - Rob;: I like how Juve have ruined lives by suddenly deciding they won't sell Dybala with 6 hrs to go
08/08/2019, 11:22 - David;: Never bought into the idea Tottenham would get him anyway
08/08/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: United might have though
08/08/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: I would like Eriksen to move abroad for no money after the prem window shuts
08/08/2019, 11:54 - David;: When's his contract up?
08/08/2019, 11:54 - David;: So you've gained a wild Luiz.
08/08/2019, 11:55 - David;: Right in the heart of your defence.
08/08/2019, 11:55 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
08/08/2019, 11:55 - Rob;: Fighting fire with fire
08/08/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: Next summer. I didn't mean literally no money, it will just be a lot less now
08/08/2019, 11:58 - David;: I've always said what i value most in a central defender is unpredictability, flair and set pieces
08/08/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: And shithouse aggression, important in the season they introduce VAR
08/08/2019, 12:07 - David;: Will teams like Burnley just be fucked now? Unable to defend corners by just quietly elbowing and jostling people.
08/08/2019, 12:09 - Rob;: I mean it hasn't been used for that sort of thing that much
08/08/2019, 12:09 - Rob;: More insane accidental handballs
08/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: If Emil Krafth has a man of the match performance, could have the headline 'Krafth Work'.
08/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: The world cup though. All those pennos Kane got.
08/08/2019, 12:12 - Jack G;: I wonder why no teams have adopted that single file lineup at set piece strategy that Gareth Southgate perfected
08/08/2019, 12:15 - David;: Zidane's handling of the Bale situation puts me in mind of Phil's approach to Football Manager 09, when he insisted on making Torres rot on the bench.
08/08/2019, 12:15 - David;: Such a reckless way to squander your prime asset
08/08/2019, 12:49 - Phill: New guy at works unlce owns Sunderland FC. He's telling us about the Netflix documentary.
08/08/2019, 13:17 - Jack G;: Andy Carroll back to Newcastle - oh dear Mike Ashley
08/08/2019, 13:23 - David;: Could be good, his boyhood club.
08/08/2019, 13:25 - Jack G;: How can he pass the medical though?

08/08/2019, 17:39 - Phill: A poor man's Robbo
08/08/2019, 17:41 - Rob;: He actually cost a lot more, so a rich man's Robbo mor accurate
08/08/2019, 17:42 - Rob;: I like the look of him. Imagine his defensive ability and fitness record will be immediately tainted by signing though
08/08/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: Looks like we might be getting ¬£40m for Iwobi ü§î
08/08/2019, 18:49 - David;: So Everton. Front 3 Iwobi, Moise, Richarlison in front of Siggurdson
08/08/2019, 18:49 - David;: Not bad
08/08/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Yeah it's an ok mix of pace, power and skill
08/08/2019, 18:56 - Jack G;: The battle for 7th-10th is going to be intense
08/08/2019, 19:32 - David;: Not a great week for Cenk Tosun
08/08/2019, 19:41 - David;: The anticipation. New Seasy

08/08/2019, 20:47 - Damian Rumble: The Victoria park ashes?
08/08/2019, 20:48 - Phill: Need Jules chipper code

09/08/2019, 10:39 - David;: Lol, is some unfortunate slogan translation?
09/08/2019, 10:42 - David;: No Maupay?
09/08/2019, 10:43 - Rob;: I have no idea
09/08/2019, 10:43 - Rob;: Perhaps one part of a scrolling message?
09/08/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Jack, talk to me about West Ham's defenders
09/08/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Who do you think will start?
09/08/2019, 10:58 - Jack G;: Masuaku Balbuena Diop Fredericks
09/08/2019, 10:58 - Jack G;: Fredericks and Masuaku both very attaching so best to go for them over either CB
09/08/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: Good to know
09/08/2019, 10:59 - David;: Cresswell?
09/08/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: You have a decent run of fixtures week 2 onwards
09/08/2019, 10:59 - Paul;: Rob, what‚Äôs your team?
09/08/2019, 11:00 - Jack G;: He‚Äôll rotate with Masuaku so Fredericks is the safer option for fantasy football
09/08/2019, 11:01 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
09/08/2019, 11:02 - Rob;: Kelly scares me because he's in 24% of teams, so big potential for him to drop in value if he doesn't start. Then you can't buy anyone with 3.9
09/08/2019, 11:02 - David;: Old pumping Billy on the bench, I've done the same
09/08/2019, 11:02 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
09/08/2019, 11:03 - Rob;: Always a place for the highest scoring Englishman on my bench
09/08/2019, 11:03 - David;: Better than Kane
09/08/2019, 11:03 - David;: More goals.
09/08/2019, 11:04 - David;: Surprised you're not starting him
09/08/2019, 11:04 - Jack G;: King Kane
09/08/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: If I could sell Kane and have two Billys I would
09/08/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: Price drops for Kane and Salah this season seem like freebies
09/08/2019, 11:04 - David;: Gary goals
09/08/2019, 11:05 - Rob;: The Sharp shooter
09/08/2019, 11:05 - David;: Big exposure to the everton defence?
09/08/2019, 11:06 - Paul;: And you all laughed at digne
09/08/2019, 11:06 - David;: First they came for the trade unionists
09/08/2019, 11:06 - Paul;: Come crawling back into the digne fold
09/08/2019, 11:07 - Jack G;: Still got Drossard in your team Paul?
09/08/2019, 11:07 - Paul;: Barkley
09/08/2019, 11:07 - David;: First name on my team sheet
09/08/2019, 11:08 - Rob;: I imagine swapping keeper in the first few weeks, but I think Everton's good fixtures might help
09/08/2019, 11:09 - Paul;: Jack let‚Äôs see your team
09/08/2019, 11:10 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
09/08/2019, 11:13 - David;: Is Ozil still a thing?
09/08/2019, 11:13 - Rob;: I think at 7m there's a chance Ozil could become good value
09/08/2019, 11:13 - Rob;: But he could end up being in and out again
09/08/2019, 11:13 - Rob;: Wait and see I think
09/08/2019, 11:14 - Jack G;: He should play against Newcastle though I imagine?
09/08/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: He has never played Newcastle away
09/08/2019, 11:14 - David;: Lol
09/08/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: Not 100% he'll start.
09/08/2019, 11:15 - David;: How did you have that info straight to hand
09/08/2019, 11:15 - David;: Starts of every arsenal player vs every premier league opponent. Rain man rob.
09/08/2019, 11:16 - Rob;: It was in a season preview I read; someone else did the groundwork for me
09/08/2019, 11:16 - David;: How many times has Moreal started at home to Bournemouth?
09/08/2019, 11:17 - Rob;: The writer was pointing out how few away games he's started while at Arsenal
09/08/2019, 11:23 - David;: Nice that Iwobi played exactly 100 league games for you. Keeps his wikipedia record nice and clean
09/08/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 11:23 - David;: Needs to always work in 100 multiples through his career
09/08/2019, 11:23 - David;: would have been better if he'd scored 10 not 11 goals
09/08/2019, 11:24 - Rob;: Sort of wish we could have shifted Mhki instead, Iwobi's workrate, pace and dribbling are nice assets to have in the squad, but we got a good price
09/08/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: More useful assets than languid ineffectivity
09/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: Yeah he's been shit
09/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: That deal cursed all involved
09/08/2019, 11:26 - Rob;: Yeah. Definitely a curse
09/08/2019, 11:27 - Rob;: Neither can live while the other survives
09/08/2019, 11:27 - Jack G;: Both a massive plague on the wage bill as well
09/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 11:30 - Rob;: Raul Sanllehi and Edu seem quite astute and proactive. Hoping the overpaying of ineffective midfielders dies with fucking Gazides
09/08/2019, 11:31 - Jack G;: Gazidis - the bald fraud
09/08/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: Good luck to AC Milan
09/08/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: He was such a classic marketing dickhead
09/08/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Um HELLO, United Vs Chelsea
09/08/2019, 12:52 - David;: yeah yeah
09/08/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: This particular weekend
09/08/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: The return of everything right in the world
09/08/2019, 12:53 - David;: Finding it difficult to get work done. Too distracted
09/08/2019, 12:53 - David;: Remember the days when we would have been planning this for weeks. Would have based an entire weekend of frousting around it.
09/08/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: We're in a lull having just finished an issue. I'm not even pretending to work
09/08/2019, 12:54 - Rob;: Yeah. We should get that back one season
09/08/2019, 12:55 - David;: We would have been simultanesously playing football manager and watching actual management. Absorbing football through real and virtual media.
09/08/2019, 12:56 - David;: Spurs villa should be an interesting game as well
09/08/2019, 12:56 - Rob;: One of the few occasions I'll support villa
09/08/2019, 12:56 - Rob;: Leicester Wolves interesting
09/08/2019, 12:57 - David;: whats your villa beef?
09/08/2019, 12:57 - Rob;: Foxes Vs wolves. The canine derby
09/08/2019, 12:57 - David;: is that the one televised or the arsenal game?
09/08/2019, 12:58 - Rob;: My dad hates them, which I think is just a bit of a local Chippy thing, but they've often popped up as a jebby little bogey team for Arsenal, which has cemented it for me
09/08/2019, 12:58 - Rob;: And the John Terry connection now
09/08/2019, 12:59 - David;: I'm indifferent to positive. Liked that team they had with Young, Milner, Downing, Agbonlahor
09/08/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: That was quite good
09/08/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: I've always liked how 'shit on the villa' has caught on as a phrase
09/08/2019, 13:01 - David;: Stilian Petrov
09/08/2019, 13:02 - David;: John Carew
09/08/2019, 13:04 - David;: Rob what was your favourite ever non-Arsenal team in the prem?
09/08/2019, 13:05 - David;: Pulis' Stoke I presume
09/08/2019, 13:07 - David;: I quite liked the blackburn team with Gamst-Pederson and Bentley
09/08/2019, 13:07 - David;: And Allardyced Trollton Wanderers
09/08/2019, 13:07 - Paul;: Surely Middlesbrough with Juninho
09/08/2019, 13:07 - David;: Roque Santa Cruz
09/08/2019, 13:08 - David;: That era before city became good but had bought loads of ridiculous players and were still managed by Hughes. Was amusing.
09/08/2019, 13:08 - Paul;: Stephen Ireland
09/08/2019, 13:08 - Paul;: Huge player
09/08/2019, 13:08 - David;: Yeah, Stephen Ireland feeding Robinho
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: I loved the Reading side that came up when we were in sixth form
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: Real plucky fuckers
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: Kevin Doyle, Kitson, Shane long up front
09/08/2019, 13:09 - David;: Fucking Kitson
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: Nicky Shorey, Steve Sidwell, Harper
09/08/2019, 13:10 - David;: they were all ginger
09/08/2019, 13:10 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 13:10 - Rob;: A team of plucky gingers
09/08/2019, 13:10 - Rob;: Played as them on Footy Manager so they were my lads
09/08/2019, 13:11 - David;: I gained a huge affinity for Sunderland through FM. Managed a middling early 2010s Sunderland squad to the title.
09/08/2019, 13:11 - Paul;: Think that Blackburn team wins it for me though as Dave suggested, gamst, Bentley and roque
09/08/2019, 13:11 - Rob;: Yeah that was a good team
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: Benny McCarthy
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: Chris Samba at the back?
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: Big Samba
09/08/2019, 13:12 - David;: Yeah Samba
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: Massive
09/08/2019, 13:13 - Rob;: Gamst and Bentley were big fantasy buys
09/08/2019, 13:14 - David;: Huge.
09/08/2019, 13:14 - Rob;: Moyes' United might be my favourite side actually
09/08/2019, 13:14 - Rob;: Him and Fellaini here to fuck shit up
09/08/2019, 13:15 - David;: Ah I liked that little Portsmouth team that Redknapp put together with lots of ridiculous players.
09/08/2019, 13:15 - Rob;: The constant reincarnation of Defoe and Crouch
09/08/2019, 13:15 - Rob;: One's big and one's small, see, it's unplayable
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: People just don't know what height to defend at
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: The yhad Kranjkar, Kanu, Lassana Diarra, Glen Johnson
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Jack G;: Was a big fan of that Newcastle team with Cisse and Ba
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Sully Muntari was there
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Before his Inter move
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: Sol Campbell
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: Ridiculous squad
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: Distin
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: That Portsmouth team brought them a brief moment of glory, but it's ruined them ever since
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Big Linvoy Primus
09/08/2019, 13:17 - Rob;: Pedro Mendes?
09/08/2019, 13:18 - David;: what was the glory - did they win a little FA cup?
09/08/2019, 13:18 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
09/08/2019, 13:18 - Rob;: Yeah FA cup
09/08/2019, 13:19 - Rob;: Roy Hodgson's Europa League final team. Based essentially around Hangerland's huge bonce
09/08/2019, 13:19 - Rob;: *Fulham
09/08/2019, 13:20 - David;: That was a bonce though
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Who else did they have?
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Dempsey?
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Old Clunt
09/08/2019, 13:20 - David;: Yeah the fulham team was great, with Berbatov
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Clemp Dumpsey
09/08/2019, 13:21 - David;: Your Zamoras
09/08/2019, 13:21 - David;: That little bald cunt striker as well
09/08/2019, 13:21 - Rob;: Andy Johnson?
09/08/2019, 13:22 - Rob;: Climp Derpsey
09/08/2019, 13:22 - David;: yeah andy johnson
09/08/2019, 13:23 - David;: they had dembele before he went to spurs
09/08/2019, 13:25 - David;: Redknapp generally constructed madcap ridiculous teams. His spurs one where they had Bentley, Bale, Modric, Van der Vaart, Berbatov, Defoe
09/08/2019, 13:32 - Rob;: Clampt Clumpsey
09/08/2019, 13:35 - David;: Klump Clampsey
09/08/2019, 13:35 - David;: Klerk Clumpsey
09/08/2019, 13:36 - Jack G;: Klimp klompsey
09/08/2019, 13:36 - David;: Klerk Derpsey
09/08/2019, 14:58 - Jack G;: Can‚Äôt wait for there to be a controversial VAR decision tonight. I ‚ù§ VAR
09/08/2019, 15:01 - David;: Var is shit. Runing football.
09/08/2019, 15:01 - Jack G;: No more offside goals from Salah üëå
09/08/2019, 15:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Not aware of this being a  significant issue
09/08/2019, 15:08 - Rob;: With VAR Salah would have scored 3 goals
09/08/2019, 15:09 - Rob;: It is known
09/08/2019, 15:12 - Jack G;: Rainman Rob strikes again
09/08/2019, 15:19 - David;: You'd be more on the mark if you focussed on his soft penno's
09/08/2019, 15:21 - Jack G;: They‚Äôve also changed the handball rules for this season. Watch pundits still not be able to agree on whether something is handball or not
09/08/2019, 15:23 - Rob;: Maybe they should do VAR after the match, so you play on then find out if you won later
09/08/2019, 15:24 - Rob;: No gaps in play. You have to try to win by more than one goal
09/08/2019, 15:24 - David;: So you could be 3-0 down without knowing, playing out for the draw?
09/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 15:27 - Damian Rumble: I'm just going to leave this here...
09/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: So if you score a dodgy -seeming goal you feel like you need another as insurance
09/08/2019, 15:29 - Jack G;: What happens if someone got a red card unfairly?
09/08/2019, 15:30 - David;: The entire game would have to be re-modelled in a simulation to remove all of their subsequent touches and see how the game panned out.
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Jack G;: Lol
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Replay for the remaining minutes
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Everyone in the crowd has to come back to recreate the exact atmosphere
09/08/2019, 15:31 - David;: Nah huge computer simulation to determine who won.
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Ok
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Sure
09/08/2019, 15:32 - David;: So most games are now just simulated. Any game that had an overturned decision has to be modelled virtually.
09/08/2019, 15:33 - Jack G;: Just simulate the whole season now, no need to play any matches
09/08/2019, 15:34 - Jack G;: Or you can broadcast all simulations each game week. Go to the pub to watch a computer churn out a result
09/08/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: Yeah, and even though it could be processed in one day, they still stage it August to May
09/08/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: So they can input actual weather conditions
09/08/2019, 15:35 - David;: Or you have an endless brancing of game scenarios that have to be played. So e.g. in a game someone gets sent off. You have to play the game through from there 11 vs 11 as if it was an incorrect decision, and also 10 vs 11 from there as if it was correct. And then if more questionable decisions happen within those different replays you also have to play both of those through to the end. So you could end up with 10-20 different versions of the match.
09/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: The game takes weeks to play. Then you assess with VAR which version sould actually be picked as the result.
09/08/2019, 15:38 - David;: How does the data on player statistics and attributes come from if no games are being played though. Would we eventually end up watching randomly generated players like in FM?
09/08/2019, 15:42 - Rob;: No, people have to have careers and train etc in order to provide data for the simulation
09/08/2019, 15:44 - David;: Ah right yeah
09/08/2019, 15:44 - David;: So still playing matches but just behind doors to generate the data
09/08/2019, 15:45 - David;: Do we know who the players are, get to see their faces etc. - you could have them as pundits commentating on their own simulated careers, analysing their performances, dissapointed when they go off form in the simulations etc.
09/08/2019, 16:13 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
09/08/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: They're like people who've had films based on their life
09/08/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: I would love for Delia to do another drunken half-time speech tonight
09/08/2019, 16:48 - Paul;: What‚Äôs the impact on wages and sponsorship? Are they represented as a badly rendered computer sprite. People have posters of them up rather than the actual person
09/08/2019, 16:48 - Paul;: A grainy player on the footy man pitch in the simulation
09/08/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Jack get Ozil out
09/08/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Not in the squad due to CRIME
09/08/2019, 18:13 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah he‚Äôs out already
09/08/2019, 19:54 - David;: Are they they taking Drmic?
09/08/2019, 19:56 - Rob;: Dr Mic Drmic
09/08/2019, 20:00 - Damian Rumble: Captain Mane. Mane starts on the bench. Off to a great start...
09/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: Could have told you that
09/08/2019, 20:01 - Jack G;: >not researching. Mane barely played pre season
09/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: It was known
09/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: New rule - dont have to goal kick out of box now
09/08/2019, 20:02 - Rob;: Yeah Damo you'd have found that out by reading any preview
09/08/2019, 20:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Doubt he will get on unless we need a goal
09/08/2019, 20:04 - David;: Pukking hell
09/08/2019, 20:06 - Jack G;: Teemu Pukki
09/08/2019, 20:06 - Jack G;: Strong name
09/08/2019, 20:09 - David;: Divock
09/08/2019, 20:09 - David;: Only scores awful or bizare goals
09/08/2019, 20:10 - Hamish Sinclair: With the only exception being in the champions league final
09/08/2019, 20:12 - Paul;: Top of the league then
09/08/2019, 20:22 - David;: Pub I'm in also has partick thistle vs Dundee showing. Much more interest in that game.
09/08/2019, 20:22 - Paul;: Pukki almost with a goal
09/08/2019, 20:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you in the Wally dug?
09/08/2019, 20:23 - David;: Nah don't think Wally has sports
09/08/2019, 20:24 - David;: Norwich look good
09/08/2019, 20:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah I agree
09/08/2019, 20:26 - Jack G;: Need to sharpen up at the back here for sure
09/08/2019, 20:38 - Paul;: Damo, how furious are you with mane?
09/08/2019, 20:49 - Jack G;: Hansen sitting next to Deliah
09/08/2019, 20:53 - David;: Shattered broken little Gary neville
09/08/2019, 20:53 - David;: Love it
09/08/2019, 21:02 - Damian Rumble: All the previews I looked at only focused on who was going to play. Not who wasn't
09/08/2019, 21:03 - Phill: As a data analyst, could you not infer the later from the former?
09/08/2019, 21:03 - Damian Rumble: Somewhat mediated by having by van dijk and trent
09/08/2019, 21:04 - Damian Rumble: My model didn't have a feature for inexplicably leaving you best player from last season on the bench
09/08/2019, 21:04 - Damian Rumble: Noob error really...
09/08/2019, 21:05 - David;: Highly explicable
09/08/2019, 21:05 - David;: The explanation is Afcon
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Rob;: Mane coming on and doing nothing to waste your captaincy must hurt
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Phill: Top of the leage
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Paul;: Lol that‚Äôs great
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Paul;: Liverpool‚Äôs year
09/08/2019, 21:58 - Hamish Sinclair: THE CHAMPIONS ELECT
09/08/2019, 22:23 - Damian Rumble: And another year of FF related butt hurt begins...
09/08/2019, 22:23 - David;: Champions elect
09/08/2019, 22:24 - Damian Rumble: Couldn't even keep a clean sheet
09/08/2019, 22:24 - David;: How many points are you  on?
09/08/2019, 22:26 - Paul;: 15 pts
09/08/2019, 22:55 - Phill: 22 pts
09/08/2019, 22:56 - David;: 22
09/08/2019, 22:56 - David;: Salah (c) + robbo?
09/08/2019, 23:00 - Phill: Yeah
09/08/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: 28 so far, Salah (C) and Virgil
09/08/2019, 23:13 - David;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 08:43 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 08:53 - Paul;: Shithousery
10/08/2019, 08:57 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 08:58 - Sam;: Pepe and lacazette are also doubts
10/08/2019, 09:32 - David;: Lol
10/08/2019, 09:32 - David;: He's literally been there a day
10/08/2019, 09:37 - Jack G;: He was already injured at Celtic though, Arsenal were aware of this before signing him
10/08/2019, 10:03 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 10:10 - David;: More excited about the punditry or the match?
10/08/2019, 10:10 - David;: What's the starting line-up United?
10/08/2019, 10:12 - Sam;: Honestly don‚Äôt know. Back 5 is sorted, but after that it‚Äôs only rashford pogba and martial that‚Äôs nailed on.
10/08/2019, 10:13 - David;: The boy Fred?
10/08/2019, 10:14 - David;: The boy James?
10/08/2019, 10:15 - Sam;: Can‚Äôt see Fred getting it. Would like to see a bold choice in drop matic and platings mctominay and pereira mata or lingard through the middle
10/08/2019, 10:16 - David;: Is Sanchez just ded now?
10/08/2019, 10:17 - Sam;: If he can‚Äôt be flogged in this window then he‚Äôll have to be a back up player
10/08/2019, 10:17 - David;: That's mental
10/08/2019, 10:19 - Sam;: Has to be done to make a statement that United won‚Äôt pay silly wages to get a big name anymore. If you don‚Äôt perform you‚Äôre out. Sanchez is that last one of those signing left
10/08/2019, 10:21 - Jack G;: You did well to get so much cash back for Lukaku
10/08/2019, 10:21 - David;: So Maguire's minimum wage then?
10/08/2019, 10:23 - Sam;: He‚Äôs not just a big name. Clearly a good defender and we needed a CB. We didn‚Äôt need Sanchez, it was clearly opportunistic and to try and beat city
10/08/2019, 10:24 - Sam;: Not part of a clear strategy like OGS has now. Which is why lukaku had to go
10/08/2019, 10:36 - Hamish Sinclair: What's this story?
10/08/2019, 12:06 - David;: Cresswell starts Jack
10/08/2019, 12:06 - David;: Instant bad information
10/08/2019, 12:07 - David;: Strong front 4 for west ham
10/08/2019, 12:15 - Jack G;: I did mention he‚Äôd rotate with Masuaku. Cresswell is better defensively so makes sense to play against Sterling
10/08/2019, 12:20 - Jack G;: Hoping for a Lanzini master class
10/08/2019, 13:15 - Jack G;: City getting away with so many niggly fouls
10/08/2019, 13:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah they do that
10/08/2019, 13:17 - Jack G;: 10 fouls 0 yellows
10/08/2019, 13:17 - Hamish Sinclair: They make fouls high up the pitch because your more likely to get booked the closer they get to goal
10/08/2019, 13:17 - Hamish Sinclair: They did it all last season
10/08/2019, 13:42 - Rob;: Mental
10/08/2019, 13:42 - Rob;: Varce
10/08/2019, 13:43 - Jack G;: Lol thanks VAR
10/08/2019, 13:44 - Jack G;: I ‚ù§ VAR
10/08/2019, 13:56 - Paul;: VAR shit though? Everyone is hating it
10/08/2019, 13:59 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 13:59 - Jack G;: Offside is offside
10/08/2019, 14:00 - Damian Rumble: Brexit means Brexit
10/08/2019, 14:00 - Rob;: But it was an offside I'm not sure a linesman would ever spot in real time. An offside in letter but not in spirit
10/08/2019, 14:01 - Jack G;: Fuck off Ederson
10/08/2019, 14:04 - Jack G;: VAR again p
10/08/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: That was brilliant
10/08/2019, 14:11 - Rob;: Of ffs
10/08/2019, 14:11 - Rob;: This is just  exhausting
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Rob;: Still love VAR, Jack?
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs getting embarrassing
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Paul;: Lol trolled by var
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: Would rather the match had just been simulated
10/08/2019, 14:14 - Jack G;: This is going to happen every penalty. Keepers are so used to jump starts
10/08/2019, 14:19 - Paul;: And we can‚Äôt get rid of var?
10/08/2019, 14:19 - Paul;: No going back?
10/08/2019, 14:19 - Jack G;: Ffs
10/08/2019, 14:20 - Damian Rumble: Fucking hate it when the two most expensive players in the game both live up to their extortionate price tag
10/08/2019, 14:20 - Paul;: Who has sterling?
10/08/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: Bottom of the league then
10/08/2019, 14:21 - Paul;: Ah of course Dave has sterling
10/08/2019, 14:33 - Paul;: Time for big sig
10/08/2019, 14:34 - Rob;: Bigurdson?
10/08/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: Yeah. Anticipating a huge season
10/08/2019, 14:40 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs all about Digne
10/08/2019, 14:40 - Paul;: Sharp on the bench
10/08/2019, 14:41 - Paul;: Digne overhyped
10/08/2019, 14:51 - Damian Rumble: Digne can suck a bag of dicks
10/08/2019, 14:52 - Sam;: Digne is quality. Dwight McNeil starting for Burnley.
10/08/2019, 14:52 - Paul;: Dwight McNeil?
10/08/2019, 14:55 - Sam;: I think he‚Äôll be quality, just wasn‚Äôt sure if Dyche would give him enough minutes to break through
10/08/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: I hope Burnley get back their defence
10/08/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: That trolled me so hard last season
10/08/2019, 14:56 - Paul;: I‚Äôve put a lot of investment in defence this season
10/08/2019, 15:08 - Sam;: FOOTBALL
10/08/2019, 15:57 - David;: Not thrilling so far
10/08/2019, 16:47 - Rob;: The Sharp shooter
10/08/2019, 16:48 - Paul;: Old sharpers
10/08/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Billy the adult
10/08/2019, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: SEAGULLS
10/08/2019, 18:08 - David;: Pumping billy
10/08/2019, 18:09 - David;: So prem level then
10/08/2019, 18:09 - David;: World class
10/08/2019, 18:18 - Paul;: Is that good enough for you Sam
10/08/2019, 18:18 - Paul;: Doubting Samuel
10/08/2019, 19:25 - Paul;: Kane. Hib.

11/08/2019, 11:31 - Phill: Always said that.
11/08/2019, 11:31 - Phill: Overrated shit.
11/08/2019, 11:37 - David;: Which one? World cup or the flick around the player
11/08/2019, 12:27 - Paul;: Flick around
11/08/2019, 12:33 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
11/08/2019, 12:46 - David;: This was in an official medical context?
11/08/2019, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, in the medical notes. Legal document right there
11/08/2019, 13:37 - Phill: How has this person acquired a gash next to her gash?
11/08/2019, 14:20 - Hamish Sinclair: That's not explained
11/08/2019, 15:49 - Rob;: Almiron is a strange looking bloke

11/08/2019, 16:03 - Damian Rumble: Yaaaas England
11/08/2019, 16:08 - Jack G;: Arsenal have equaled the total number of away clean sheets they had last season
11/08/2019, 16:09 - Rob;: Yeah, champions as home, relegation fighters away last season
11/08/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: Mason Mount - stupid name
11/08/2019, 16:33 - Sam;: Mount Mason better?
11/08/2019, 16:33 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
11/08/2019, 16:33 - Rob;: Would climb
11/08/2019, 16:54 - Jack G;: Zouma looks shocking, bet Chelsea are glad they sold Luiz
11/08/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: New Ukip leader is called Dick Braine
11/08/2019, 17:33 - Damian Rumble: What even is ukip?
11/08/2019, 18:09 - Rob;: Chelsea ded
11/08/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Maguire and wan Bissaka were bargains
11/08/2019, 18:43 - Phill: Chelsea are complete toilet now

11/08/2019, 18:45 - Rob;: No chance of him keeping his place
11/08/2019, 18:46 - Sam;: Who replaces
11/08/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Ozil, Cellabos or Willock directly
11/08/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Or just reshuffle things a bit and bring in any of the other attackers - Lacazette or Pepe
11/08/2019, 18:50 - Sam;: Yeah, still to see how the boy Pepe fits in
11/08/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: In winnable matches I would like to see:
.            Lacazette
Auba                        Pepe
.         Ozil or Cellabos
.        Torreira   Xhaka
Tierney                   Bellerin
.        Sokratis  Holding
11/08/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: In tougher matches swap the number 10 for another deeper lying midfielder
11/08/2019, 19:00 - Sam;: Just need a huge CB to be decent
11/08/2019, 19:00 - Sam;: A slab head if you will
11/08/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Yeah, and then upgrade on Xhaka
11/08/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Hopefully Saliba next season will be the one at CB
11/08/2019, 19:28 - Paul;: Salibaba and the 40 thieves
11/08/2019, 19:42 - Rob;: Listening to a radio programme about trephaning. First interviews an old dude who drilled a hole in his head himself because he wanted to be high all the time
11/08/2019, 19:43 - Rob;: Maintains that it's made him feel 30% high all the time
11/08/2019, 19:43 - Rob;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p074k65t
11/08/2019, 19:44 - Paul;: Proven to work is it?
11/08/2019, 19:45 - Rob;: He seems very happy
11/08/2019, 19:45 - Rob;: And, crucially, is alive
11/08/2019, 19:48 - Paul;: What kind of high is it?
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: He rated normal like as 0 and acid as 100, so closer to normality as acid
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: He defined it as higher consciousness
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: He just loves blood in his brain
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: Will do anything for more blood there
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Paul;: How does it work in terms of drilling through the skull?
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Paul;: His brains out there for the world
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: He had an antique instrument
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: And local anesthic
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: Had some aborted attempts on his forehead
11/08/2019, 19:59 - Paul;: But is he just left with a gaping hole and that‚Äôs fine?
11/08/2019, 20:01 - Rob;: I think you leave the skin and let it heal over the hole
11/08/2019, 20:08 - Paul;: Still quite mental
11/08/2019, 21:42 - Stefan;: Very reassuring to have the skin regrow over the hole
11/08/2019, 21:43 - Stefan;: Babies have that hole in their skull - presumably they're 30% high all the time
11/08/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Yes that was actually a point he made
11/08/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: He linked your skull firming up as you grow up to original sin and the loss of innocence
11/08/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: Said he had returned himself to the higher consciousness of childhood
11/08/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: A more instinctive animal -like state that he says humans lost when they began to walk upright and blood was less able to reach the brain.
11/08/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: He ‚ù§ brain blood
11/08/2019, 21:47 - Paul;: I don‚Äôt get how drilling a hole equals more brain blood
11/08/2019, 22:01 - David;: Will probably give that a miss
11/08/2019, 22:01 - Rob;: It gives your blood vessels more room and makes the whole skull less rigid so there is more room
11/08/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: Proper surgeons will on occasion bore holes in your skull to relieve some disorders
11/08/2019, 22:03 - David;: Very close with the antique instrument
11/08/2019, 22:04 - David;: How normal or mental did he come across?
11/08/2019, 22:04 - David;: Would you employ him?
11/08/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: I think if he were speaking about other things you wouldn't necessarily guess he had a hole in his head
11/08/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: Sounded quite old and eloquent
11/08/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: Stopped himself once or twice and said, 'you must think me mad when I say this'
11/08/2019, 22:06 - Rob;: Sounded like a granddad but just loves getting high. Moved to Amsterdam for the buzz.
11/08/2019, 22:16 - Paul;: <Media omitted>

14/08/2019, 22:58 - David;: Trophy in the bag. Still on  for the sextuple

16/08/2019, 11:50 - David;: Love to see who will be the bench keeper. Lonergan himself was out of contract over the summer and training with us for free.
16/08/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: I love how football can elevate people suddenly into huge situations
16/08/2019, 11:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Apparently lonergan the oldest english player to make his premier league debut in the 21st century, I'd it happens
16/08/2019, 11:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Great to see everyone who bought adrian last week get fucked over though
16/08/2019, 11:54 - Rob;: 'I'm afraid since the CEO, chairman and head of operations are all of sick, the intern is our only option to lead the important meeting, as he's the only direct understudy, and of course the meeting cannot be rearranged'

16/08/2019, 11:54 - Rob;: I settled on waiting for two weeks of data with which to make changes
16/08/2019, 11:55 - David;: You always have to build in 0.5 buffer. Prices go Rob
16/08/2019, 11:55 - David;: I bought Adrian in so got a bit fucked - but seems like if he misses this week will be in for next anyway.
16/08/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: I have options. I don't need all my bench players to start

20/08/2019, 11:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Hes more expensive than origi
20/08/2019, 11:19 - Paul;: Feels good owning him when no one had belief. Only I stood by him. Knew his potential
20/08/2019, 11:19 - Paul;: Never gave up on him
20/08/2019, 11:22 - David;: Didn't have him in the first week. Jumped on the bandwagon.
20/08/2019, 11:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah
20/08/2019, 11:29 - Rob;: I went for him, but he's not in the long term plan necessarily, he just frees up value to shift around midfield
20/08/2019, 11:30 - Rob;: Cellabos is the future
20/08/2019, 11:30 - Hamish Sinclair: What is cellabos?

20/08/2019, 11:32 - Hamish Sinclair: What kind of midfielder are we talking?
20/08/2019, 11:32 - David;: Isnt he deeper lying though?
20/08/2019, 11:32 - Rob;: 5.5, was expected to play deep, but played number 10 at the weekend and got two assists
20/08/2019, 11:33 - Rob;: Xabi Alonso / Santi Cazorla-esque ball player with a range of passing
20/08/2019, 11:33 - Rob;: Looks good for a booking though
20/08/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: He will probably play deeper in some games, but imagine he will still remain decent value for 5.5. He'll never be defending
20/08/2019, 11:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Hes already got a band wagon rolling
20/08/2019, 11:34 - Hamish Sinclair: 5.6m
20/08/2019, 11:35 - Rob;: Cue sending off next week in huge defeat to Liverpool
20/08/2019, 11:37 - David;: I wont be investing

20/08/2019, 11:42 - Paul;: Yeah trossard. First name on the team sheet
20/08/2019, 11:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Solly March has potential, playing wide left wing back, will get goals and assists
20/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Brighton could be the new Watford
20/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Burnley the new Stoke / the old Burnley

20/08/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: Bit of variety
20/08/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Draft Nodd in

20/08/2019, 11:56 - David;: But better - has scored more goals
20/08/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: Yeah, Kane not yet Sharp
20/08/2019, 11:59 - David;: I refuse to negotiate with Digne
20/08/2019, 11:59 - Hamish Sinclair: I was part of dignes grassroots support
20/08/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: Been with digne from day 1
20/08/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: Shunned for my support. Now vindicated
20/08/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, always been in for the boy Digne
20/08/2019, 12:06 - Paul;: Dave, is there anyone you‚Äôre negotiating with?
20/08/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Lindstrom
20/08/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Lindstram*
20/08/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Midfielder. Classified as a defender.
20/08/2019, 12:08 - David;: In negotiations with Aubameyang but he's asking too much
20/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: My representatives are also talking to Rashford.
20/08/2019, 12:10 - Rob;: I thinking of offering something to Martial
20/08/2019, 12:10 - Rob;: Dat extra point per goal
20/08/2019, 12:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Already hopped on martial
20/08/2019, 12:11 - Rob;: He's in my sights next week
20/08/2019, 12:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Aubameyang, what's he asking these days, 11?
20/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Yeah - I was going to get Martial straight swap for Moura but then Moura trolled me by scoring.
20/08/2019, 12:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Got a Dunk in this week
20/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Yeah yeah. It would require an enron style accounting fudge for me to work him in without losing sterling or Mane
20/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: I'm looking into it
20/08/2019, 12:12 - Paul;: Got my martial new in for next week
20/08/2019, 12:13 - Rob;: I had to pivot to Sterling. Can't let that get out of hand
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: Yeah that can really get away from you
20/08/2019, 12:14 - Paul;: Salah ded
20/08/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Is Salah really worth 1m more than Mane?
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: No
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: I've got Mane in now hes fit again
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: that was my transfer this week
20/08/2019, 12:15 - Jack G;: My team is fucked, might have to wildcard
20/08/2019, 12:15 - Rob;: Yeah, Mane in for Salah might help me get some non bandwagonny strikers
20/08/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: How did it fuck you up so badly
20/08/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: On the face of it looks fine
20/08/2019, 12:18 - Jack G;: Started off with pulisic, mistake. Pepe is a cash sink atm as he‚Äôs not starting and plays Liverpool next
20/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: Yeah couldnt predict any problems looking at the line-up
20/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: Lol, the cash sink
20/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: toxic assets all over your balance sheet
20/08/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: Jack he'll start soon, it'll be fine
20/08/2019, 12:19 - Jack G;: Need to keep the Pepe faith
20/08/2019, 12:19 - David;: Jack, how's your Pepe?
20/08/2019, 12:20 - Jack G;: Not so good
20/08/2019, 13:38 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
20/08/2019, 14:57 - Damian Rumble: Had to triple transfer this week. Invested in pukkie, sterling and caballos. Bandwagoning hard.
20/08/2019, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: Loving all the Mane U turns though
20/08/2019, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: Got big issues with Barkley though
20/08/2019, 15:08 - Rob;: Yeah same. I think I just have to hope he recoups value while playing easy teams. Have bigger problems to fix first
20/08/2019, 15:10 - Hamish Sinclair: This could have been avoided with some research, Mason Mount was always going to be preferred
20/08/2019, 15:11 - Rob;: He was playing really well in pre season, was tipped more than Mount
20/08/2019, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: Again the research I did told me Barkley was the favourite
20/08/2019, 15:12 - Rob;: He's cheap anyway. Not a cash sink
20/08/2019, 15:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Lampard doing a solskjaer by playing slightly inferior youth as a way to manage his narrative of average results
20/08/2019, 15:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Was always going to happen (admittedly easier to say this now it has happened)
20/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Oh dear
20/08/2019, 15:17 - Hamish Sinclair: They'd have to get 14 points to break even
20/08/2019, 15:18 - Damian Rumble: Only a four point hit as had one in hand
20/08/2019, 15:18 - Damian Rumble: Queue Sterling dry spell...
20/08/2019, 15:18 - Hamish Sinclair: More reasonable
20/08/2019, 15:19 - David;: Did you look into Pukkis next 3 fixtures? Enjoy thay
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: Got one against Liverpool
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Scored against liverpool though
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: He doesn't care who he plays
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: Scores when he wants I've heard them say
20/08/2019, 15:21 - David;: Going to enjoy the pukki bubble deflating
20/08/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt fukki the pukki. That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre saying
20/08/2019, 15:22 - Rob;: You should be so Pukki, David
20/08/2019, 15:23 - David;: I was Pukki. Identified him in pre-season straight away. But now too much buzz, he is dead to me
20/08/2019, 15:23 - David;: I will never own him
20/08/2019, 15:23 - Rob;: Have you forgiven Vardy yet?
20/08/2019, 15:24 - David;: Almost - could contemplate a Vardy
20/08/2019, 15:24 - Rob;: You were dead against for a long time. Felt like he'd wronged you
20/08/2019, 15:26 - David;: You don't see a lot of teams with vardy in these days. He's less cleche than he was
20/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: One thing I read pointed out at that at his price point there's no one even close in average point tally over teh last few seasons
20/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: If you can't have caviar, you have Vardy
20/08/2019, 15:29 - Damian Rumble: Carey has strong stats but can he do it on a wet night in Stoke?
20/08/2019, 15:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah his points per pound is proabbly still very good
20/08/2019, 15:32 - Hamish Sinclair: What do you need to forgive him for?
20/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: Not getting him until late in the year they won the league. The bandwagon that got away
20/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: Tipping Almiron to have a big season
20/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: No one would predict an almiron
20/08/2019, 15:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Would agree if Benitez still there
20/08/2019, 15:37 - Hamish Sinclair: But for the bruce
20/08/2019, 15:38 - David;: Yeah Bruce really puts a downer on things
20/08/2019, 15:40 - David;: The most underwhelming appointment in football
20/08/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Had Carry for the whole of that year and somehow managed not to win it.
20/08/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Barry*
20/08/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Vardy*
20/08/2019, 15:41 - Rob;: Billboard Baggage

20/08/2019, 22:18 - David;: They'll john that
20/08/2019, 22:18 - Rob;: Yeah
20/08/2019, 22:18 - Rob;: There's huge potential to reboot it, in some other version of the similation
20/08/2019, 22:19 - Rob;: With good writers
21/08/2019, 06:56 - Jack G;: Matrix Resurrection

21/08/2019, 11:43 - Jack G;: Looks like I‚Äôm going to be the first to arrive at Wales on Friday. Where are the keys kept? Not actually been first on the scene before
21/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Above the lower barn door to the right
21/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Paul, Sam and I shouldn't be too far behind you
21/08/2019, 11:44 - Jack G;: üëç cheers
21/08/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: Message when you get there then can let you know how far away we are/could meet up at the coop for initial booze run
21/08/2019, 12:00 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah will do. The booze wagon
21/08/2019, 12:03 - David;: So is it 4 cars going in total - Me, Jack, Paul and Phil? Could be a bit tight in the old car park.
21/08/2019, 12:04 - David;: Will my Vauxhall no be getting up the track.
21/08/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: If Paul's in the 4x4 that'll make space
21/08/2019, 12:04 - David;: Yeah will be fine, we'll tetris it somehow
21/08/2019, 12:05 - Rob;: Beer deals nonexistent at Coop. If we get a chance to Tesco first we should Tesco. Lots of 2 for ¬£20 crates
21/08/2019, 12:05 - Paul;: Not in 4x4
21/08/2019, 12:05 - David;: Also can leave a car at the middle barn if anyone can get up the first bit.
21/08/2019, 12:05 - Paul;: Ok Tesco enroute
21/08/2019, 12:06 - Rob;: 72 Carlsberg for ¬£40. Hate the taste live the value
21/08/2019, 12:06 - Paul;: How‚Äôs the old track these days? Phil said he made it up when he last went
21/08/2019, 12:06 - David;: We're better than this now
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Quite fearful of wrecking the underside of my car otherwise would go up
21/08/2019, 12:07 - David;: Surely we're beyond Carlsberg
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: I‚Äôll be getting that deal
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Booze in the bonce. Done
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Rob;: 80 bottles of Stella for ¬£40?
21/08/2019, 12:08 - David;: What car are you in? There's 2 slightly sketchy bits, the first corner and then steep bit after the barn.
21/08/2019, 12:08 - Paul;: Audi
21/08/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: 80 bottles will go in an afternoon
21/08/2019, 12:08 - David;: Its not in a worse or better state than it usually is, but its generally quite shit.
21/08/2019, 12:08 - Jack G;: Will you be purchasing craft ales Dave?
21/08/2019, 12:09 - David;: Yes.
21/08/2019, 12:09 - David;: Bottled stella goat
21/08/2019, 12:09 - David;: Might need 160
21/08/2019, 12:09 - Jack G;: Also crisps, all the crisps
21/08/2019, 12:10 - Rob;: Big job carrying 160 Stella bottles to the bin. Best to car that down early doors
21/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: Might buy a bit of wine and nicer beers to mix in with the general piss
21/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: Okay 240 to be safe?
21/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: There is other bloot available though - not sure I will drink vast amounts. 160 should do it.
21/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: Need to plan meals. Could do a big chilli one night.
21/08/2019, 12:12 - Rob;: I like shifting the customary pizza meal to the last night to minimise washing up
21/08/2019, 12:12 - Rob;: Rather than night 1
21/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: Obviously background grazing pizzas
21/08/2019, 12:13 - David;: Yeah minimise waste where possible. We could do a BBQ with that in mind.
21/08/2019, 12:13 - David;: Maybe chilli Friday, BBQ saturday night and pizza sunday?
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Yeah sounds nice
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Paul;: Rob will you bringing plasters with you
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Paul;: *you be
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Always, Paul
21/08/2019, 12:15 - Sam;: let's not instantly pack the gut with chilli. can we downgrade to a mild spag bol? for all our sakes.
21/08/2019, 12:17 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm happy with either
21/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: No we need to be sharting horribly right from the beginning
21/08/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: Would a chilli make one shart?
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Rob;: Would bracket with spag bol on the gut-ometer
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Paul;: No only Sam and his guts
21/08/2019, 12:19 - David;: Ah the spice will get you though
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Sam;: exactly
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Sam;: chilli arse
21/08/2019, 12:20 - Sam;: day one
21/08/2019, 12:20 - David;: Paul you need to source lots of dried apricots
21/08/2019, 12:20 - David;: Could just do a huge claggy pasta instead of chilli.
21/08/2019, 12:20 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
21/08/2019, 12:26 - David;: Who's in for Snowdon on Saturday? The defroust to set up the deep froust
21/08/2019, 12:29 - Rob;: Yeah
21/08/2019, 12:43 - Paul;: Very dependent on the day. I make no future commitments
21/08/2019, 12:46 - Phill: Can no committ to that. Might be decending the k-hole
21/08/2019, 12:46 - David;: I put the likelihood of your involvement at 0%
21/08/2019, 12:47 - David;: When will you be cracking out the all day sleeping bag?
21/08/2019, 12:48 - Paul;: Immediately. I shall become a human rat
21/08/2019, 12:59 - David;: Preparation for the long-anticipated attempt on the summit of Snowdon was remarkably poor. The expedition allocated funds for 160 bottles of french lager, but had made no plans to acquire basic climbing equipment. Few of the team had spent any time at altitude. One of its members had stated his intention to take large amounts of ketamine the night before the summit attempt.
21/08/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: Another was a human rat
21/08/2019, 13:06 - Jack G;: One got picked up by mountain rescue after getting lost wandering off from the main trail. When questioned he answered: ‚ÄúSorry, had to find somewhere for an emergency shit, too much Chilli last night‚Äù
21/08/2019, 13:55 - Paul;: Alongside beer what else will we be needing?
21/08/2019, 13:58 - Sam;: brot
21/08/2019, 14:03 - Paul;: And nothing more
21/08/2019, 14:05 - Sam;: cheese. mustard and lea and perrins. we shall eat cheese on toast exclusively.
21/08/2019, 14:05 - Sam;: and one tomato
21/08/2019, 14:06 - Paul;: I would be fine with that. Clag me up
21/08/2019, 14:06 - Jack G;: Need some tomatoes to grill with it. Cut through
21/08/2019, 14:07 - Jack G;: Ah just saw you mentioned 1 tomato
21/08/2019, 14:08 - Sam;: that'll do us. thinly sliced. one atom thick to make sure it goes around
21/08/2019, 15:40 - David;: Low grade multi-pack crisps - 24+ multipack if possible
21/08/2019, 15:41 - David;: Bread. Cheese. Butter. Eggs. Bacon. Sauce. Fruit. Done.
21/08/2019, 15:42 - Jack G;: Biscuits?
21/08/2019, 15:42 - David;: Maybe dried food like pot noodles for when boiling a kettle will be all we are capable of.
21/08/2019, 16:12 - Sam;: ah yeah, pot nudes and other nude based snacks that just need boyling wata.
21/08/2019, 16:12 - Rob;: Have you written that like that with your brain?
21/08/2019, 16:13 - Sam;: no
21/08/2019, 16:13 - Sam;: fingers
21/08/2019, 16:13 - Sam;: (onto keyboard)
21/08/2019, 16:14 - David;: Anne Boyling
21/08/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: Like some medieval diary entry
21/08/2019, 16:15 - Rob;: Boyle the wata first before lowering in the pig's heade
21/08/2019, 16:15 - David;: He appears to be very broken
21/08/2019, 16:15 - David;: Question: where's our fibre coming from?
21/08/2019, 16:15 - Paul;: Dried apricots
21/08/2019, 16:16 - David;: So consolidating all of our fibre into one food stuff
21/08/2019, 16:16 - Paul;: One that produces incredible gas as well
21/08/2019, 16:26 - Rob;: Scattered comments in WhatsApp chat will be useless in a shop, but we can just get things based on the brief of: one main meal, one breakfast, beer, gump, pot noodles, basics
21/08/2019, 16:27 - David;: Milk - vital
21/08/2019, 16:27 - David;: Tea capability
21/08/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: Yeah, yeah
21/08/2019, 16:32 - David;: Bog roll also essential
21/08/2019, 16:33 - David;: so easy to forget

21/08/2019, 16:34 - David;: Shall we do this on Sunday morning after a night on the bloot?
21/08/2019, 17:39 - Sam;: ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt imagine ever not wanting to get fucked up‚Äù Donny Azoff
21/08/2019, 17:42 - Jack G;: Just on a permanent bender then
21/08/2019, 17:42 - Jack G;: No chance for recovery
21/08/2019, 17:48 - Sam;: Not permanent. There‚Äôs just never a final bender.
21/08/2019, 17:49 - Rob;: I can't imagine ever ruling out benders forever
21/08/2019, 17:49 - Rob;: You could have some wicked benders in your old age
21/08/2019, 17:49 - David;: Yeah - even better. No sense of health or dignity needing to be preserved
21/08/2019, 17:50 - David;: There should be a 70+ age limit on all drugs. Past that you can just do whatever, go mental.
21/08/2019, 17:51 - Rob;: Yeah
21/08/2019, 17:52 - Rob;: Once you're in a home all substance laws are off
21/08/2019, 18:11 - Phill: Might spend a day fire roasting a chicken again.

22/08/2019, 07:28 - Damian Rumble: Number 4 looks like peanuts but it probably isn't
22/08/2019, 07:29 - Damian Rumble: Number 2 looks like cumin seeds but again I think that's too vanilla
22/08/2019, 07:32 - Jack G;: Number 1 tarragon?
22/08/2019, 07:42 - Rob;: No correct guesses so far
22/08/2019, 07:42 - Rob;: There's nothing that's likely to be already there
22/08/2019, 08:15 - Jack G;: #3 turmeric
22/08/2019, 08:15 - Paul;: Frankincense
22/08/2019, 08:25 - Phill: Asafoetida
22/08/2019, 08:25 - Phill: Fenugreek
22/08/2019, 08:26 - Phill: Cumin seed
22/08/2019, 08:27 - Phill: Is bottom a chipotle ?
22/08/2019, 08:53 - Rob;: Phil's mostly on the money
22/08/2019, 08:54 - Rob;: 1. Caraway seeds
2. Sumac
3. Asafoetida
4. Fenugreek
5. Either an ancho chilli or a kashmiri. They got mixed up
22/08/2019, 09:08 - Damian Rumble: Somewhat disappointed in myself that I only know two of those
22/08/2019, 09:09 - Rob;: I intentionally chose weird ones
22/08/2019, 09:13 - Paul;: Pointless spices
22/08/2019, 09:13 - Paul;: Garlic, salt, pepper. All you ever need
22/08/2019, 09:25 - Rob;: So all your heat is coming from pepper, like in pre 1500s Europe?
22/08/2019, 09:29 - Paul;: Famously salt and pepper a classic seasoning combo
22/08/2019, 09:29 - Paul;: Are you too modern for it
22/08/2019, 09:30 - Rob;: I'm not disputing that at all
22/08/2019, 09:31 - Damian Rumble: Pepper is great but paprika is better
22/08/2019, 09:33 - Rob;: Lol, not particularly analogous flavours
22/08/2019, 09:33 - Rob;: Not a like for like swap
22/08/2019, 09:33 - Paul;: ‚ÄúPepper is great but ketchup is better‚Äù
22/08/2019, 09:34 - Jack G;: ‚ÄúMangetout is great but dark chocolate is better‚Äù
22/08/2019, 09:35 - Rob;: 'Countdown is good, but anal penetration is better'
22/08/2019, 09:40 - Damian Rumble: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/paprika-salt
22/08/2019, 09:40 - Damian Rumble: Clearly a legit combo
22/08/2019, 09:41 - Damian Rumble: Though the dream is all three
22/08/2019, 10:37 - David;: Pot noodles are good but I prefer caviar
22/08/2019, 10:37 - Jack G;: I prefer a flan
22/08/2019, 10:37 - Rob;: But the dream is pot noodles, caviar and a flan
22/08/2019, 10:38 - David;: I will be bringing Chipotle
22/08/2019, 10:38 - David;: In 3 different forms
22/08/2019, 10:39 - David;: In fact 4
22/08/2019, 10:39 - David;: Flakes, paste, actual tinned Chipotles and Chipotle salsa
22/08/2019, 10:49 - Rob;: Arse weltering
22/08/2019, 10:50 - Rob;: Throw the Kashmiri/ancho in there for good measure
22/08/2019, 10:51 - David;: But are we even doing the chilli? Thought it was dead in the water
22/08/2019, 10:51 - David;: So much spice capacity for nothing
22/08/2019, 10:51 - David;: I vote for a big grotty chilli
22/08/2019, 10:51 - Rob;: It got vetoed Friday night
22/08/2019, 10:52 - Rob;: But Saturday barbecue?
22/08/2019, 10:52 - Jack G;: What are we having instead of chilli?
22/08/2019, 10:54 - David;: >spag bol
22/08/2019, 10:54 - Rob;: I'm happy to cook Friday night, as I'll be there early and on the shopping trip
22/08/2019, 10:55 - Rob;: Could do something different and we do chilli on Sunday. Washing up will be fine
22/08/2019, 10:56 - David;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 10:56 - David;: The smoke stack
22/08/2019, 11:04 - David;: I still just think get a huge flaming chilli in early doors
22/08/2019, 11:10 - Paul;: Can we have different spice levels available
22/08/2019, 11:10 - David;: Only power
22/08/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: I do a good chicken satay, throwing it in as an option
22/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: Sounds good. Is that hard to scale up though?
22/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: How many pans needed
22/08/2019, 11:26 - Rob;: If we buy straight to work noodles only one large frying pan
22/08/2019, 11:27 - David;: Straight to work noodles. For the business executive
22/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Haha
22/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Non procrastinating noodles
22/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Real straight shooters
22/08/2019, 11:29 - David;: Never take a day off
22/08/2019, 12:13 - Damian Rumble: How about arse clenchingly hot and sphincter ruiningly hot?
22/08/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: Jenny in my pod at work is going mental for the all-day rave music on Radio 6 today
22/08/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: Sent in this and just got it read out
22/08/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 12:32 - Rob;: All lies. Most others not lapping it up. Kate I'm particular hates all music that's not 1970s/80s disco
22/08/2019, 12:32 - Hamish Sinclair: She looks well past it aswell
22/08/2019, 12:33 - Rob;: Only she's lost days to this music
22/08/2019, 12:33 - David;: Also you havent lost days.
22/08/2019, 12:33 - David;: Only 12.30 so maximum 3.30hrs lost
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: She's refering to past raves
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: If you told me she's 24 then I'd believe this
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: She's 45
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: She was big on the 90s rave scene
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, had a big one in the 90s proabbly
22/08/2019, 12:34 - David;: But that gives her more listening time to havve lost to be fair
22/08/2019, 12:35 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, her 90s stories are good
22/08/2019, 12:35 - Rob;: She loves the idea of Wales. Have discusse the benders
22/08/2019, 12:35 - David;: Was anyone disgruntled at being misrepresented for social media PR purposes?
22/08/2019, 12:36 - David;: Ah great - so she had a huge 90s? Proably best decade to get some really serious blooting in
22/08/2019, 12:36 - Hamish Sinclair: This conversation has made me put 6music on and it's currently playing underworld üëå
22/08/2019, 12:36 - Rob;: I don't think so, it's just amusing me how jarring it is for one of the people named. Literally the most Prosseco-o'clock ITV1 Formula 1 person I have ever met
22/08/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Yeah, it's been a fun show so far
22/08/2019, 12:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Love that description
22/08/2019, 12:37 - David;: Same. Am loving it to be fair
22/08/2019, 12:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Literally lost 6minutes of my life to this song
22/08/2019, 12:38 - David;: Lol, that paints a picture
22/08/2019, 12:39 - David;: But how does that translate to disco? Would imagine pop is the only place you can go from there
22/08/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Disco at its worst: it's raining men etc
22/08/2019, 12:41 - David;: Ah
22/08/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: Ok poppy disco things like Earth, Wind and Fire, but preferably played on repeat every day forever
22/08/2019, 12:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Should apply that rule to describing all people, 1. Drink 2. TV channel. 3. Sport
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Rob;: Yeah, could work
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Sambo = stella artois, sky sports news, premier league football
22/08/2019, 12:42 - David;: Sambo: Carlsberg 20 pack Sky Sports Footy
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Or variations thereof
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Rob;: Prosseco-o'clock about more than just the drink though: the sort of person who says that
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Hamish Sinclair: True
22/08/2019, 12:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Like the kind of person who tells you "your on the lash"
22/08/2019, 12:44 - Stefan;: This person also has a "live, laugh, love" fridge magnet and at least one union jack cushion
22/08/2019, 12:45 - Jack G;: ‚ÄúKeep calm and carry on‚Äù on the wall too
22/08/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: Yeah this has nailed everything
22/08/2019, 12:46 - Stefan;: Definitely. And if they live in London, a poster that says "When a man is tired of London, he's tired of life"
22/08/2019, 12:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, frequently hung in the house of someone desperate to move to the chilterns
22/08/2019, 12:46 - David;: Would give christmas presents still wrapped in the shop bought wrapping with very elaborate bows etc.?
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Hamish Sinclair: This is a pretty brutal character assassination on your collgeue tob
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Rob
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Rob;: Kate is 50 something and  wine of those 'purple women' - hair, clothes, bag, diary, computer mouse
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Rob;: She's my boss
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Rob;: She's very good at a lot of boss things, but someone I could never have much in common with on a personal level
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Sam;: What she needs is a good shaggin
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Rob;: Perhaps, Sambo
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Jack G;: Haha
22/08/2019, 12:48 - David;: Where would she go on holiday - always a generic med destination?
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Hamish Sinclair: üëç
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Jack G;: Benidorm?
22/08/2019, 12:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Corfu
22/08/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: If she wasn't childless and affluent, yes
22/08/2019, 12:50 - Jack G;: Tenerife then
22/08/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: But instead she's on a mission to do as much flying and meat eating as possible
22/08/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: In the last year: china, Costa Rica, Japan, Botswana, Florida, gran Canarian. Separate trips
22/08/2019, 12:52 - Jack G;: Decent
22/08/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: What is this kind of person?
22/08/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: And what shop has this
22/08/2019, 13:24 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 13:25 - Paul;: The Nokia ngog
22/08/2019, 13:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Bloy Blodgson
22/08/2019, 13:43 - Damian Rumble: This woman sounds like she has cracking taste in music though ü§©
22/08/2019, 13:46 - Sam;: RIP my brother Junior Agogo
22/08/2019, 14:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Now playing the macarena, is this bringing the music more inline with the itv/F1 girl?
22/08/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: Yeah, that she would lap up
22/08/2019, 14:32 - David;: Would I no predict a Botswana. But if would have been uxury safari-type trip?
22/08/2019, 14:33 - David;: When you get chocolates or perfume and they do a little shit pre-wrapping for you and then you would just hand it to the person like that.
22/08/2019, 14:34 - David;: Ah. Peak Hodgson. With the out of position Jonjo Shelvey at right wing. >Konchesky
22/08/2019, 14:35 - David;: His big signing along with an aging Joe Cole on a free with 90,000 a week wages
22/08/2019, 14:39 - Rob;: So her travel vibe is #holidayqueen, with the hashtag inserted into her out of office. A lavish lifestyle funded by timing (cheap flat now worth lots) and singledom ("didn't have a kid, had a life instead" - her catchphrase). Insane calculation of annual leave to stretch days off as much as possible. Coming into work directly from the airport after a long-haul flight etc. Lots of group tours of wonderful sites or things like safari (especially if she can eat  or ride the animals) with new people. No relaxing.
22/08/2019, 14:40 - Rob;: Takes 341 photos, hands around an iPad so everyone can view
22/08/2019, 14:41 - David;: I understand.
22/08/2019, 14:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Does she bring the lack of kids up in most conversations completely unpromted
22/08/2019, 14:42 - David;: "#holidayqueen, with the hashtag inserted into her out of office" - ah
22/08/2019, 14:42 - Rob;: Yes. All the time
22/08/2019, 14:43 - David;: "Insane calculation of annual leave to stretch days off as much as possible. " How is this enron-style accounting working? You can't get more days than the total.
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Hamish Sinclair: The 2 weeks in may between the bank holidays
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Or around easter
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Rob;: Buys an extra five, connects up the may bank holidays, never takes more than needed to account for rest or travel. That sort of thing
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Rob;: Will be running a meeting 2hrs after flying back from Bali etv
22/08/2019, 14:45 - David;: But it always amounts to the same total holiday days
22/08/2019, 14:46 - David;: Apart from the 5 she buys - what even is that policy as well?
22/08/2019, 14:46 - Rob;: A lot of companies let you buy or sell some
22/08/2019, 14:46 - Rob;: It does all add up to the same, but it doesn't feel like that
22/08/2019, 14:49 - Damian Rumble: Tbh this just sounds like a smart  way to make the most of your holidays to me
22/08/2019, 14:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, but annoying to work with someone who meticulously plans their leave around the bank holidays, as often you cant all be off at the same time
22/08/2019, 14:52 - Rob;: Yeah, and she's a stickler for people not being off at the same time
22/08/2019, 14:53 - Rob;: In principle it's fine, it's just another facet to her personality that makes her unfit for a rave-based call-out on Radio 6
22/08/2019, 14:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Gets her leave in 11months in advance
22/08/2019, 15:08 - David;: So are we doing the chilli?
22/08/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: I'm up for it. Friday or Sunday
22/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Let's call it when we're there. Pasta on Friday, BBQ Saturday then either chilli or pizza on Sunday?
22/08/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: Chilli for lunch always an option
22/08/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: More than one meal in a day
22/08/2019, 15:33 - David;: Ah yeah. Game changer. Don't just have to eat thin sliced bread and anaemic ham for lunch every day.
22/08/2019, 15:33 - David;: Okay yes big chilli saturday lunch? Before the BBQ. really load up on meat and spice.
22/08/2019, 15:43 - Damian Rumble: Sounds like mind and body is going to be thoroughly blooted this weekend. I am not sure how Sam's anus will be able to deal with this...
22/08/2019, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 17:20 - Damian Rumble: Need to get me one of these called the psychonaut
22/08/2019, 18:50 - David;: Sound? I've got a Bluetooth add on for the Bose now. Any advances?
22/08/2019, 18:50 - David;: I also have the boombar
22/08/2019, 18:50 - Rob;: I have my Wonderboom with me, small, bluetooth waterproof, floats
22/08/2019, 18:50 - Rob;: One for the reservoir
22/08/2019, 18:51 - David;: Nah
22/08/2019, 18:52 - David;: I love how sound systems seem to assume a constant quest for boom
22/08/2019, 18:53 - David;: Boom is what everyone is looking for
22/08/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. Wouldn't touch a speaker without boom up front
22/08/2019, 18:58 - David;: Boom actually sounds awful. Droning, thudding boom
22/08/2019, 18:59 - David;: Opressive
22/08/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: Yeah, boom something you try to reduce
22/08/2019, 19:01 - David;: 'i like this track but I wish it was more boomy. It's too balanced - i can still pick out the tune'
22/08/2019, 19:04 - Paul;: Bring all the boom
22/08/2019, 19:18 - Sam;: Can anyone bring a laptop? I can log into sky so we can watch pool vs arse
22/08/2019, 19:25 - David;: But wifi ded
22/08/2019, 19:25 - David;: Muh wifi
22/08/2019, 19:25 - David;: When is it? We can watch it in that grotty pub in the town where we wanted the world cup final
22/08/2019, 19:37 - Damian Rumble: That was a pretty good pub tbh. Would recommend
22/08/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Will bring my Bose
22/08/2019, 20:32 - David;: Is that same as mine?
22/08/2019, 20:32 - David;: If so I won't bother
22/08/2019, 20:36 - Jack G;: Tether some 4G?
22/08/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: Maybe we can get some 12kb dual up?
22/08/2019, 20:41 - David;: Why would we theater a shitty laptop screen stream?!
22/08/2019, 20:41 - David;: This is madness
22/08/2019, 20:41 - David;: Just pub it
22/08/2019, 20:42 - Phill: No it's the little Bluetooth one that is portable
22/08/2019, 20:43 - David;: Ah yeah - that mirrors and improves upon the functionality of a boombar. The boombar has no purpose
22/08/2019, 20:45 - Paul;: How were you going to get hold of internet?
22/08/2019, 20:46 - Phill: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 20:46 - Phill: Why are we even discussing acquiring internet?
22/08/2019, 20:46 - David;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 20:54 - Rob;: Record breaker
22/08/2019, 22:45 - David;: Rob do you have ticket to Ride?
22/08/2019, 22:46 - David;: Also has anyone got a footy?
22/08/2019, 22:46 - Rob;: I think you're gonna be sad
22/08/2019, 22:46 - Rob;: No, I borrowed it before
22/08/2019, 22:48 - David;: But rooooob
22/08/2019, 22:49 - Rob;: Do I nooo have a ticket
22/08/2019, 22:52 - David;: We should coordinate which offline playlists for Max coverage
22/08/2019, 22:53 - David;: E.g. I can do Chope, Gorrilaman
22/08/2019, 22:54 - Rob;: I have them all I think
22/08/2019, 23:11 - David;: Bring bedding

23/08/2019, 09:50 - Sam;: You‚Äôre going up the track yeah?
23/08/2019, 10:03 - David;: Key above barn door to the rigght
23/08/2019, 10:17 - Phill: Leave some space for me to park later I'm in my shitty fiat so won't be getting up the track
23/08/2019, 10:19 - Sam;: Jack. You have to parl at the top now. But wait to collect beer from us
23/08/2019, 10:22 - Phill: Who's travelling with who?
23/08/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: Dave make your chilli tonight

23/08/2019, 11:29 - Phill: That blared out at full volume in a silent office
23/08/2019, 11:38 - / James Ball: Have g√ºd Wales. First person to unravel a turd above the top of the elsan wins.
23/08/2019, 11:48 - Jack G;: Let me know when you guys are almost here and I‚Äôll head down
23/08/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Don't bother
23/08/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: We're in the shop doing the bug shop

23/08/2019, 16:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Where is that draining from?
23/08/2019, 16:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Kitchen?
23/08/2019, 16:53 - Paul;: Think the kitchen
23/08/2019, 16:53 - Paul;: Took us a while to work out
23/08/2019, 16:53 - Hamish Sinclair: How does it smell?
23/08/2019, 16:53 - Paul;: Like poo, lavender and piss
23/08/2019, 16:53 - Paul;: And dying mice
23/08/2019, 16:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Not sure how you're going to plunge that

"Dave Coplin, founder of AI consultancy the Envisioners, also had a play with the system, inputting the first line of a classic joke: A man walks into a bar...

The suggestion from the AI was not what he was expecting: "...And ordered two pints of beer and two scotches. When he tried to pay the bill, he was confronted by two men - one of whom shouted "This is for Syria". The man was then left bleeding and stabbed in the throat".

28/08/2019, 09:08 - Rob;: It might be two if Bolton go too
28/08/2019, 09:17 - Rob;: Actually, I think it will just mean a team doesn't get relegated from the league instead

29/08/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: Ah
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Change rendered useless
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Ded for how long?
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Paul;: Unknown
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Jack G;: Pukki in Martial out
29/08/2019, 16:35 - David;: Made 2 changes.
29/08/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: Not sure it's worth paying 4 pants to get out a player I just got in
29/08/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: Four of my pants
29/08/2019, 16:36 - David;: All I'll say is that it's going to be one Haller a ride.
29/08/2019, 16:36 - Paul;: Not going to sacrifice an additional point
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Jack G;: Just had to take point hit to get rid on Martial
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Seems premature, .authorities only miss one game
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Paul;: Wait until update then see how long he‚Äôs out for
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Eagerly awaiting scan resulys
29/08/2019, 16:38 - Jack G;: Only need replacement to get a few extra points to make it back though, can‚Äôt rely on my bench to do any good atm
29/08/2019, 16:38 - David;: Nah it's a thigh - you don't come back from those
29/08/2019, 16:38 - Hamish Sinclair: But if your bench player can get 2, then your new signing needs 6 just to break even
29/08/2019, 16:39 - David;: Yes. But price Dynamics and team value to factor in as well
29/08/2019, 16:39 - Jack G;: Yeah martial will take a massive price hit
29/08/2019, 16:39 - Hamish Sinclair: True, but theres no definite info on this injury
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Rob;: Hopefully can make change one minute after the deadline before he has fallen in value - the are a lot of transfers in that will need to be cancelled out before he starts slipping
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Sam, what nuggets from the utd message  boards ?
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Paul;: Unlikely. People already made their changes
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Is this going to rush people into wildcards?
29/08/2019, 16:41 - Hamish Sinclair: International break coming up so could recover from minor tear in <4weeks
29/08/2019, 16:42 - Jack G;: This speeds up my route to de bruyne by a week as well
29/08/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Do I need sterling. Is there a master plan I can work on
29/08/2019, 16:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Sterling looks essential, but I will not be purchasing
29/08/2019, 16:44 - David;: I may be playing my wildcard in the int break
29/08/2019, 16:44 - David;: Reassess
29/08/2019, 16:44 - Jack G;: Pukki first on the team sheet?
29/08/2019, 16:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Do prices go down mid game week
29/08/2019, 16:44 - Hamish Sinclair: As in do I need to panic on martial now or will it only kick in next game week?
29/08/2019, 16:45 - David;: He will never play in a team I manage. And I've told that to the board.
29/08/2019, 16:46 - Jack G;: I‚Äôve joined the bandwagon, had to be done
29/08/2019, 16:47 - David;: Yeah I read somewhere they happen at 1am. Maximum 0.1 up or down  a day. They have to cross a threshold of a certain amount of transfers to trigger it
29/08/2019, 16:48 - David;: *net transfers
29/08/2019, 16:48 - Hamish Sinclair: The mad rush to get your squad sorted by 1am
29/08/2019, 16:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Reckon martial will go down tonight
29/08/2019, 16:49 - Paul;: Martial not going anywhere
29/08/2019, 16:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Just a fleshwound
29/08/2019, 16:51 - Jack G;: You do need legs to football though
29/08/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: I don't think he will
29/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: Must have had loads of net transfer in up until just now. Has to override that
29/08/2019, 16:55 - Hamish Sinclair: It cant all be done on net though?
29/08/2019, 16:55 - Hamish Sinclair: How does a shot 4.0 defender who never plays deteriorate if noone had him in their team?
29/08/2019, 16:57 - Jack G;: Need damian to do some data mining
29/08/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Reading about it on Reddit - price changes thought to happen overnight, capped at 0.1 up or down, max 0.3 in a weeks
29/08/2019, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Is it based in absolute in/outs or on %change?
29/08/2019, 16:58 - Paul;: This is turning into mass hysteria. Martial is fine. No price changes
29/08/2019, 16:59 - Rob;: That is less clear, the thread I found doesn't think it's linear
29/08/2019, 17:05 - David;: For falls it can also be a % of ownership threshold
29/08/2019, 17:06 - David;: Net transfers - absolute for rises. Absolute or % of ownership whichever happens first for falls
29/08/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: You win some you lose some on price rises. I would say losing 4 points is maybe not worth saving 0.1 million
29/08/2019, 17:10 - Jack G;: You‚Äôve got to think of the knock on as well though. You‚Äôd have to use your transfer next week on Martial rather than doing the one you‚Äôd planned to improve your team
29/08/2019, 20:30 - Phill: I go to the pub for a pint and this...
29/08/2019, 20:31 - Phill: <Media omitted>

29/08/2019, 22:23 - Phill: YOU AND I WE GONNA BILL FOREVER
29/08/2019, 22:26 - Paul;: I wanna bill forever
29/08/2019, 22:38 - Phill: Jack, I'm just going to say. This is as good as it was 15 years ago. I'm having such a great time.
29/08/2019, 22:41 - Hamish Sinclair: What does Becca think of it?
29/08/2019, 22:46 - Damian Rumble: There's some good animal spirits on display here. Massive speculation followed by inevitable hubris. I'm happy to sit back and reap the rewards of my pre season research into De Bruyne. Assist machine.
29/08/2019, 22:46 - Damian Rumble: Definitely banking that wildcard for use later in the season
29/08/2019, 22:50 - Rob;: Research into international star and  former player of the year?
29/08/2019, 22:51 - Phill: She's down with it
29/08/2019, 22:52 - Paul;: Some innovative research there
29/08/2019, 22:54 - Phill: Paul, asmongold has as many viewers as Pyramid stage at glasto
29/08/2019, 22:54 - Phill: Process that.
29/08/2019, 22:54 - Paul;: That seems low
29/08/2019, 22:54 - Paul;: Would expect more

30/08/2019, 08:54 - Phill: Not all. A week.
30/08/2019, 08:54 - Hamish Sinclair: No wales next year
30/08/2019, 08:54 - Hamish Sinclair: How confident are you that this wont fuck your life up after 1 week?
30/08/2019, 08:55 - Damian Rumble: One doesn't simply walk out of wow
30/08/2019, 08:55 - Phill: Well I've already said that I will still be playing evenings and weekends until I get to level 60. Once I get my pre-raid best in slot gear raid nights are Wednesdays and Sundays
30/08/2019, 08:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Have you taken up another administrative role?
30/08/2019, 08:56 - Phill: I'm considering it
30/08/2019, 08:58 - Jack G;: The rep grinds, the profession grinds though - going to need to sink a lot of time into it
30/08/2019, 08:59 - Phill: Doing my professions as I level up
30/08/2019, 08:59 - Phill: But I sink a lot of time into watching shit on TV or watching YouTube anyway
30/08/2019, 09:02 - David;: 'the rep grinds'
30/08/2019, 09:03 - Damian Rumble: How will you have time for fantasy football
30/08/2019, 09:03 - David;: So using your holiday on a second job, essentially
30/08/2019, 09:04 - Jack G;: I can remember spending days killing owls for iron feathers to make my best in slot pre-gear.
30/08/2019, 09:05 - Phill: Yeah. The new economy has so little buying power at the moment so can't make loads of gold yet.
30/08/2019, 09:07 - David;: Any info on who are emerging as the big guilds etc.?
30/08/2019, 09:07 - Phill: Nah not yet
30/08/2019, 09:07 - Phill: Method will probably be top
30/08/2019, 09:08 - Phill: They are in retail
30/08/2019, 09:09 - David;: In retail?
30/08/2019, 09:09 - Phill: Current version of the game
30/08/2019, 09:12 - Jack G;: Bet Blizzard are peeved at how popular this is. Everyone basically saying that the changes made and development over the last 15 years are just shite
30/08/2019, 09:13 - David;: Yeah lol how did they fuck it all up?
30/08/2019, 09:13 - David;: Are the graphics better?
30/08/2019, 09:15 - Phill: Classic graphics are a bit better but purely because we use HDMI now not AVG on CRT monitors. No real changes to the games underlying graphics have been implemented.
30/08/2019, 09:16 - David;: Doesn't it just look a bit shart now?
30/08/2019, 09:16 - David;: Pretty old graphics engine now

30/08/2019, 09:16 - Phill: You tell me?
30/08/2019, 09:18 - David;: Yeah quite cluncky
30/08/2019, 09:21 - David;: Will be amusing to me if Lukaku and Sanchez at inter suddenly look really dynamic and effective
30/08/2019, 09:34 - Sam;: I expect them to do well to be honest. Lukaku was sold due to system change. And if S√°nchez does well it just means there‚Äôs more chance of a market developing for clubs wanting to buy him
30/08/2019, 09:58 - Rob;: In a web chat with an IT man called Christopher William Prog
30/08/2019, 09:59 - Rob;: He'll hate it when Christopher William Punk comes along
30/08/2019, 11:07 - Paul;: Oh look, martial hasn‚Äôt changed in price
30/08/2019, 12:24 - David;: total rent for Wales was ¬£197, so about ¬£33 each. If you stick that in the tricount we can square off.
30/08/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: I've put it in
30/08/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: However I think it's missing the chilli and chicken shop
30/08/2019, 12:28 - Paul;: I thought Sam added that?
30/08/2019, 12:29 - Rob;: <Media omitted>

08/09/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: I went to that Fleabag performance. Having sent the show it was pretty much pointless, beyond the vague interest to see the original and how it was fleshed out into a TV series
08/09/2019, 20:47 - Rob;: Probably was very good in Edinburgh originally, but now you know the jokes and the twist

16/09/2019, 21:27 - David;: Haller still on for a hat-trick yeah?
16/09/2019, 21:27 - Jack G;: Can*
16/09/2019, 21:28 - David;: VAR seems to get used for nothing but trolling
16/09/2019, 21:44 - David;: Jaaack, where's the Haller goal?
16/09/2019, 21:53 - Jack G;: Dunno but I got some decent clean sheet points
17/09/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: Of course it's Lord Pannick investigating parougation
17/09/2019, 12:12 - Stefan;: The supreme court have brought out 11 of their team of 12 for this one. Usually it's only 3 or 5.
17/09/2019, 12:12 - Stefan;: Lord Briggs left alone on the bench
17/09/2019, 12:16 - Rob;: Did Briggs just not fancy it?
17/09/2019, 12:16 - Rob;: Picked up a knock in training
17/09/2019, 12:19 - Stefan;: Conditions aren't right for him. Commercial law specialist, bit of a one-trick pony
17/09/2019, 12:20 - Stefan;: They always have an odd number to avoid a tied vote
17/09/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: How would you rate your own chances for making the squad for the supreme court?
17/09/2019, 12:33 - Stefan;: As a white male Oxbridge graduate, I'd say pretty good
17/09/2019, 12:51 - David;: Could Briggsy do it on a wet night in Stoke?
17/09/2019, 12:53 - David;: Just going to be a let down isn't it. They will side with the English cunts and it will allow Johnson to claim some moral victory
17/09/2019, 12:53 - David;: Seems like the court of sessions was mainly in it for the trolling
17/09/2019, 13:08 - Stefan;: I have a feeling they'll deliver on the night. Constitutional law academics were very critical of the English decision, it side stepped the issues
17/09/2019, 13:15 - David;: But isn't that because those issues are under-defined?
17/09/2019, 13:16 - David;: They said we can't pass judgement on this because it's outside the scope of formal constitutional law
17/09/2019, 13:19 - Stefan;: They said there are no manageable legal standards by which a court could judge the appropriate length of a prorogation. But the issue isn't the length itself, it's the PM's improper purpose/motive (to prevent parliamentary scrutiny). It's well established in constituonal law that govt can only use its powers for proper purposes
17/09/2019, 13:20 - Stefan;: If the English decision is right, PM could legally prorogue parliament for a year
17/09/2019, 13:21 - David;: Ok but what about where motives are mixed - i.e. he can credibly claim an incoming gov needs a queens speech but everyone know this also helps him re. Brexit
17/09/2019, 13:22 - Jack G;: I think the length of prorogation is an issue here, would normally be much shorter for a queens speech
17/09/2019, 13:23 - David;: Yes but that seems correct legally, but practical problems (passing budgets) and political problems (being seen to have no legislative agenda) are what stop this
17/09/2019, 13:23 - Stefan;: Still unlawful if one of the motives is improper
17/09/2019, 13:25 - Sam;: and they fuckin are davo!
17/09/2019, 13:26 - Stefan;: Pannick's point is that the length demonstrates the real and unlawful purpose. PM hasn't given an affidavit (as is usual in such cases) to explain his motives on oath.
17/09/2019, 13:26 - David;: So I cure cancer but a minor motivation for doing so was to get laid - i shouldn't be allowed to do that?
17/09/2019, 13:27 - David;: Keep cancer, you're saying
17/09/2019, 13:27 - Sam;: I ‚ù§ cancer
17/09/2019, 13:28 - Stefan;: This would be a great line from the govt lawyers, you should write to them
17/09/2019, 13:28 - Stefan;: Anyway I'm going into court now to deal with repair bills from a minor car accident
17/09/2019, 13:29 - David;: Wig on?
17/09/2019, 13:29 - Stefan;: Case isn't important enough for wigs
17/09/2019, 13:33 - David;: Lord Briggs on fire, the defence is terrified.

22/09/2019, 17:54 - David;: Emery out?
22/09/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: There is a break clause in his contract for the end of this season, unless things change I can see the club using it
22/09/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: But doubt it would happen mid-season
22/09/2019, 17:59 - David;: So they'd rather write off a season of development than pay off a little conty?
22/09/2019, 18:01 - Rob;: All depends on what manager you could get mid-season and if you think they're the person to take you forward
22/09/2019, 18:17 - Jack G;: I heard Mourinho is available

22/09/2019, 18:43 - David;: Che Adams. And the answer is Aguero
22/09/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: Seems like an upgrade, yes
22/09/2019, 18:44 - David;: This de bruyne fad won't last

22/09/2019, 18:48 - David;: Robertson 3 bonus points still to roll in
22/09/2019, 18:48 - David;: Trent got booked as well
22/09/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: Probably cost him the bonuses. Double whammy
22/09/2019, 18:52 - David;: Mass exodus from Digne
22/09/2019, 18:52 - David;: Good to see
22/09/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: Not quite as bad as a booking and conceeding 8 goals though

22/09/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: But David, he's lying about being a defender
22/09/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: And it's working, getting defensive points while trying to make goals
22/09/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: And no one's noticed
22/09/2019, 19:35 - Phill: I hyped lindstram in Wales but no one listened. Who's laughing now.

24/09/2019, 11:00 - Jack G;: I think the opposition will want to wait until they‚Äôve forced Boris to get an extension before a genny
24/09/2019, 11:00 - Paul;: Genny ASAP surely

24/09/2019, 11:38 - Paul;: Who to vote for
24/09/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: Quite a big monumental cock up
24/09/2019, 12:03 - Damian Rumble: I honestly feel that Boris' best move is to resign as pm. Instruct his stand in to extend article 50. Then run for leadership of the party again on the grounds of putting principles before party and lead to Tories to victory in a December general election.

25/09/2019, 08:07 - Stefan;: If a no confidence vote passes now, it could lead to parliament being dissolved (if the opposition can't agree on a new PM/government)

Three attendees at the relevant meeting in Coventry this week told the BBC this was not an accurate reflection of Monday's meeting with manufacturers. 

'I was at the meeting. There's no way that is the message he could have gone away with,' said one business leader. "

26/09/2019, 14:33 - Jack G;: Has Boris actually won a vote yet?
26/09/2019, 14:49 - / James Ball: Just a little prorogation
26/09/2019, 14:50 - Jack G;: But that wasn‚Äôt a vote?
26/09/2019, 14:54 - Stefan;: He lost the vote on prorogation 11-0
26/09/2019, 15:02 - / James Ball: Ah
26/09/2019, 15:03 - / James Ball: Judges also not a vote
26/09/2019, 15:07 - / James Ball: So the only vote he's won wasn't a vote and was ruled unlawful and void
26/09/2019, 15:10 - Stefan;: I suppose technically the queen voted for his prorogation request, so he won that one
26/09/2019, 15:14 - Damian Rumble: Won a vote the total electorate was one and if she didn't vote for it she would be immediately de throned
26/09/2019, 15:40 - Rob;: 7?
26/09/2019, 15:42 - David;: Beach no paid
26/09/2019, 16:10 - Jack G;: Bercow now saying that 5th is the earliest possible date a genny could be held now. How has Dominic Cummings fucked up their politic strategy this badly?
26/09/2019, 17:07 - David;: He hasn't
26/09/2019, 17:07 - David;: Fits their narrative perfectly
26/09/2019, 17:09 - Jack G;: But they needed to force a genny before the extension deadline (18th October) but now there‚Äôs no chance the opposition would go for it as we‚Äôd default to no deal
26/09/2019, 17:09 - Jack G;: If Boris goes to a genny having requested an extension he‚Äôs in bother
26/09/2019, 17:11 - David;: I don't think he is - he just says 'i tried everything but parliament are frustrating the will of the people so you need to give me a majority.'
26/09/2019, 17:12 - David;: Express, Sun and Mail back him up with screechy betrayal stories
26/09/2019, 17:12 - David;: And he's home
26/09/2019, 17:12 - Jack G;: But he‚Äôs already said he‚Äôd rather be dead in a ditch than request an extention. He‚Äôs very hardline on it, would make him look like a right idiot
26/09/2019, 17:13 - David;: Turns the whole thing into a referendum on this parliament rather than his non-existent domestic agenda and lack of leadership or character.
26/09/2019, 17:13 - Stefan;: But polling suggests a big Brexit party boost if there's an election after an extension. It's polling on a hypothetical scenario so you have to be cautious, but I'm sure they'd gain at his expense
26/09/2019, 17:15 - Sam;: Not if the brexit means brexit crowd believe he did all he could but parliament blocked everything. Parliament vs the people. Bollocks obviously but that‚Äôs the play
26/09/2019, 17:15 - David;: I think he's done enough with the prorogation and betrayal bill language to firm up the brexit vote
26/09/2019, 17:15 - David;: Leavers will realise voting brexit party just makes it less likely and he will play up 'vote brexit get Corbyn l' fears
26/09/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: But how can we have our Brexit if we haven't finished our meat?
26/09/2019, 17:16 - David;: Basically, brexit vote is reasonably concentrated and remain vote is evenly splintered lib Dem/lab/green. That just structurally fucks everything
26/09/2019, 17:17 - Sam;: In other news, Richard Keogh is out   For the rest of the season after he and his teammates were injured in a pissed up car crash. Hard one to explain to the manager

26/09/2019, 17:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, hes made it look like he tried
26/09/2019, 17:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Pretty sure they now consider him "their guy"
26/09/2019, 17:19 - David;: Yes - everything that lowers his appeal to us makes him more popular with cunts.
26/09/2019, 17:19 - Rob;: Corbyn has been absolutely perfect for the whole ruse too
26/09/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: Divisive and off-putting to huge numbers of potential Labour voters

26/09/2019, 18:00 - Damian Rumble: I was home recently and had a depressing conversation with my parents. They are the typical west Oxfordshire remain voting Tories. They hate what the government is doing to the country but the threat of socialist Corbyn in government some how provides them with a mental block that stops them for voting for anyone other than the conservatives.
26/09/2019, 18:01 - / James Ball: Simple Damo, just don't let them out of the house to vote.
26/09/2019, 18:01 - Jack G;: Lib Dem surely
26/09/2019, 18:02 - Damian Rumble: Classic yellow Tory. Politically aligned to the lib Dems but to scared of the left to vote for them
26/09/2019, 18:02 - / James Ball: Your parents?

26/09/2019, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Less likely to vote for Tiny feet
26/09/2019, 18:13 - David;: Classic. Tell them that they can have their own thoughts and the daily mail is not a neutral information source
26/09/2019, 18:19 - David;: Aquaint then with the principles of post-Keynesian analysis
26/09/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Just exudes a huge womaniser vibe apparently. No concrete cheating
26/09/2019, 18:28 - David;: Weeeel
26/09/2019, 18:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Shagger
26/09/2019, 18:29 - David;: Finchy
26/09/2019, 18:29 - Damian Rumble: Our policy is to work with other parties to hold a people's vote before brexit happens. However, as there will likely be a general election before that date, we will campaign to cancel brexit if the people give us a mandate (by electing us to majority government).
26/09/2019, 18:30 - Hamish Sinclair: So using the geny as a proxy for a second referendum
26/09/2019, 18:31 - Damian Rumble: Yeah pretty much
26/09/2019, 18:32 - Damian Rumble: Presumably you get to vote for Lucas in Brighton. That's a pretty decent representative there
26/09/2019, 18:33 - Rob;: Sort of a, 'I'll give you a billion pounds if you can throw this ball over those mountains', sort of promise

26/09/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: I moved from Cameron to Corbyn's constituency. I'll only ever consider being represented by a party leader
26/09/2019, 18:49 - David;: What was his majjy at the genny?
26/09/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: 60.5% vote share, the seat's highest ever according to Wikipedia

26/09/2019, 22:53 - David;: It would be complicated when Munich picked up a personal Coutinho during their trip to Eurospar but put it through the tricount

27/09/2019, 09:35 - Rob;: Nowhere else has a decent infrastructure
27/09/2019, 09:35 - Rob;: And because no one knows what can and can't go in recycling, at least 25% of it is contaminated

27/09/2019, 09:43 - David;: Doesn't say they leak billions of particles. Next

30/09/2019, 21:22 - David;: Great finish

04/10/2019, 08:59 - Rob;: That's a poppadom, I believe
04/10/2019, 08:59 - Rob;: But I think we should start asking for plates made of bread next time at the Indiam
04/10/2019, 09:00 - Rob;: I have not bought that shirt yet

04/10/2019, 09:25 - Rob;: Arsenal's current away strip
04/10/2019, 09:26 - Rob;: Which is a homage to but not as good as an old kit called the bruised banana

04/10/2019, 09:51 - David;: Is it known officially as the bruised bananna?
04/10/2019, 10:03 - Paul;: Yep official name

07/10/2019, 16:04 - Rob;: My editor emailed him the question
07/10/2019, 16:04 - Rob;: He has a team, who are in part people who used to work here
07/10/2019, 16:05 - Rob;: I think he writes a decent amount of what we get back, because it contains mental phrases like 'gun in some raw garlic' and 'celebrating the delicious Ness if gnarly sausage meat'

09/10/2019, 11:55 - David;: That's the one independent variable.
09/10/2019, 11:56 - David;: Really there's no reason not to buy all the bog roll for your life now just to have it done.
09/10/2019, 11:58 - David;: So no fresh food?
09/10/2019, 11:58 - David;: Pot noodles only
09/10/2019, 11:59 - Rob;: It could actually be fun
09/10/2019, 11:59 - Rob;: Just need to think positively about it
09/10/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: Nothing in place for fresh food imports
09/10/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: No inspection point exists at Kent
09/10/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: Average delay for lorries at least 140 hours
09/10/2019, 12:01 - Rob;: Ha
09/10/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: Based on 2min extra inspection so likely to be much more than 140 hours
09/10/2019, 12:02 - Paul;: This is a logistic guy saying this who consults with the cabinet
09/10/2019, 12:02 - Rob;: I'll just wipe my arse with sovereignty, thanks
09/10/2019, 12:02 - Paul;: Says it‚Äôs all fucked and no infrastructure to deal with new import delays and regulations
09/10/2019, 12:03 - Paul;: I‚Äôll be selling bog roll for a fiver
09/10/2019, 12:03 - Rob;: Per wipe
09/10/2019, 12:03 - Rob;: More expensive thank using money to wipe
09/10/2019, 12:04 - David;: But you'd still pay to avoid the sharp bite of a 5 pound note in your crack
09/10/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: If only we hadn't gone polymer
09/10/2019, 12:05 - David;: Yeah - if you're going to wipe with cash the old 20 notes would be the gold standard

09/10/2019, 12:09 - David;: will keep forever
09/10/2019, 12:09 - David;: Don't forsee a huge uncle ben's shortage
09/10/2019, 12:11 - Paul;: No I eat them for lunch each day so just thought I‚Äôd get bulk whilst I was at it
09/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: Think all food likely to be affected anyway. Supermarkets don‚Äôt tend to hold weeks and weeks of supplies
09/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: At least I‚Äôll be shitting in glorious comfort
09/10/2019, 12:16 - David;: Shitting while Rome burns
09/10/2019, 12:18 - Paul;: We import an awful lot of food. Said we haven‚Äôt been self sufficient since 1860
09/10/2019, 12:18 - Paul;: Even long shelf life will be hoarded and gobbled
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: And we also rely on 'just in time' supply chains, stuff in the shops within a day of harvest etc, which will be hugely affected by even small delays
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Phill: Can someone repost that Greta tunberg coke meme
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Phill: Can't wait for the cliff edge
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Phill: My thirst will be quenched.
09/10/2019, 12:22 - Paul;: There was a fresh food importer there who said if any delay happens it will be worthless and rot
09/10/2019, 12:22 - Paul;: Because the supply chains are all just in time
09/10/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: At least 6 months of disruption to the supply chain  at most optimistic
09/10/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: Switzerland has 30 entry points with the EU and has 3-4 hour delays everyday. Haven‚Äôt been able to fix the issue even after 40 years
09/10/2019, 12:23 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
09/10/2019, 12:24 - David;: Lol.
09/10/2019, 12:25 - Stefan;: Yeah but I only want it to ruin the lives of the morons who have a hard-on for no deal
09/10/2019, 12:25 - Stefan;: Spare the rest of us
09/10/2019, 12:25 - David;: No I'm happy having my own life ruined to prove them wrong
09/10/2019, 12:26 - David;: I'm very eager to cut off my own nose to spite their face
09/10/2019, 12:26 - David;: Don't need my nose anyway.
09/10/2019, 12:38 - Rob;: Apparently we also important the chemicals we use to purify drinking water
09/10/2019, 13:04 - Rob;: Gems and precious metals are our 5th highest import, so I will be stockpiling those
09/10/2019, 13:22 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt wait for the cliff edge
09/10/2019, 13:22 - Paul;: I‚Äôm ready now
09/10/2019, 13:40 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I'd take that hit just to see farage standing in the smouldering ruins of Thanet offering a grovelling apology to disheveled masses of the brexit apocalypse
09/10/2019, 13:40 - Jack G;: Farage will move to the US as soon as no deal hits so that‚Äôs just a fantasy
09/10/2019, 13:41 - Rob;: It would all be someone else's fault
09/10/2019, 13:46 - Phill: You all seem to be ignoring the post no deal utopia we will be living in.
09/10/2019, 13:46 - Phill: It's inevitable.

12/10/2019, 16:13 - Phill: Didn't stop for a shit though did he
12/10/2019, 16:16 - David;: No didn't have a whole time of beans forced on him for breakfast
12/10/2019, 16:16 - David;: Didn't have to eat his weekly ration of fibre out of politeness
12/10/2019, 16:16 - Paul;: Did you shit out in the open mountainside. Doing a Radcliffe. Shamed. Fondling shit mid race
12/10/2019, 16:21 - Rob;: Different race
12/10/2019, 16:21 - Rob;: This was a shit minutes into an urban half I believe
12/10/2019, 16:21 - David;: No this was my reading half marry not the cader race
12/10/2019, 16:21 - David;: No shitting on cader just pain
12/10/2019, 16:22 - Paul;: Shitting minutes into it?
12/10/2019, 16:27 - David;: Not minutes in at all. Was on mile 9
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: I thought Fay had to wait for you? Guess you RNA the whole thing together?
12/10/2019, 16:28 - David;: Intense stomache cramps. Confident it improved my time overall.
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: That's big discipline, that
12/10/2019, 16:28 - David;: Yeah we ran together so she waited.
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: I can never be fucked with that, if Julia wants to be slow, that's fine, but I'm not dropping pace
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Paul;: At the start line. Straight off to the shitter
12/10/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: I think Fay told me about it and she gave me the impression it was earlier
12/10/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: This is a biologist's autocorrect
13/10/2019, 09:32 - Rob;: It struck me this morning that if Carmel Essery's first baby follows in her footsteps, Carmel will be a grandma in the next year or so
13/10/2019, 09:46 - David;: So great granny at 48?
13/10/2019, 09:46 - Rob;: Yes
13/10/2019, 09:46 - Rob;: Great great great by 80

13/10/2019, 15:51 - Hamish Sinclair: So approaching a week
13/10/2019, 15:53 - Phill: Yeah yeah
13/10/2019, 17:25 - Sam;: Just watched Joker. Total mess
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Phill: On a scale of 1-butthurt?
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Damian Rumble: Loved the darkness
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Sam;: Butt devastation.
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Phill: Should I watch it electric?
13/10/2019, 17:30 - Sam;: Could easily be a stand alone film with no connection to the comic book origins. Actually quite shit. Hope there‚Äôs no sequels or prequels.
13/10/2019, 17:31 - Sam;: The most common piece of dialogue in the script must have been, (joker laughs).
13/10/2019, 17:34 - Phill: Well...he is...the...joker...so
13/10/2019, 17:35 - Sam;: For minutes at a time. Paid to watch that
13/10/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: I agree it's total shit. The only thing they got right was casting Joaquin Phoenix
13/10/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: It has so many plot points that are straight out of a Year 6 creative writing lesson
13/10/2019, 17:40 - Rob;: It's a skip fire of a film
13/10/2019, 17:40 - Paul;: So they‚Äôve actually fucked it up?
13/10/2019, 17:41 - Sam;: Yeah, forgot to write a film. Just a series of ‚Äòedgy‚Äô scenes depicting mental breakdown.
13/10/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: And they go for this fauning 'well of only people with mental health problems were given proper help...' angle, which they completely undermine by also being very insensitive and one-dimensional about it
13/10/2019, 17:43 - Sam;: Also fucked up what time period it‚Äôs supposed to be set in. Charlie Chaplin on a the cinema. Electronic/Digital equipment in the hospital
13/10/2019, 17:44 - Paul;: I would assume go with the latest technology?
13/10/2019, 17:45 - Sam;: Nah, the Chaplin film dates in specifically. They show a famous scene
13/10/2019, 17:45 - Paul;: Couldn‚Äôt possibly be showing an older film in a more modern age?
13/10/2019, 17:47 - Paul;: What year is it?
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: They give all the TV broadcasts a late 60s early technicolour look
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Paul;: If I‚Äôm watching a film from 1962 it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm in 1962
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: To be fair to them, Gotham city isn't real
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Sam;: What?
13/10/2019, 17:49 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
13/10/2019, 17:49 - Rob;: Is that a specific Batman page?
13/10/2019, 17:50 - Paul;: https://screenrant.com/joker-movie-year-set-1981/
13/10/2019, 17:50 - Paul;: Specific non generic source
13/10/2019, 17:52 - Sam;: The fact that people needed to write articles about it says enough. If I was enjoying the film I probably wouldn‚Äôt have been thinking about when it‚Äôs supposed to be set
13/10/2019, 17:52 - Paul;: So Sam if you‚Äôre watching a film set now but they show a film from the 1930‚Äôs in a scene that would overrule the use of technology in the film and place it‚Äôs time period to the film they‚Äôre watching?
13/10/2019, 17:54 - Sam;: There‚Äôs other factors than the two I pointed out.
13/10/2019, 17:54 - Sam;: Cunt
13/10/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: From watching it, the time period of the film isn't obvious. The Chaplin film is made to feel current, and clashes with lots of other little moments
13/10/2019, 17:55 - Sam;: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/mbmxpa/this-joker-parody-about-a-gritty-oscar-the-grouch-is-perfect?utm_source=dmfb

13/10/2019, 18:31 - David;: So Sam when we were listening to the white album in Wales were you convinced we were actually in the 1960s?
13/10/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Film definitely make the Chaplin showing seem contemporary
13/10/2019, 18:36 - David;: What year was the dark Knight set?
13/10/2019, 18:37 - Sam;: It was set in the same era it was released. 21st century
13/10/2019, 22:57 - Stefan;: Wasn't the joker film made specially for/about incels?

14/10/2019, 20:00 - David;: Is Southgate aware of a team called Liverpool?
14/10/2019, 20:00 - David;: Trent, Gomez - not interested
14/10/2019, 20:01 - Jack G;: Keane and Trippier though, honking on that
14/10/2019, 21:38 - Sam;: Was anyone else aware that Cheick Tiot√© died in 2017?
14/10/2019, 21:39 - Paul;: Tiote cheick you mean

17/10/2019, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: A deal the
17/10/2019, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: Then
17/10/2019, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: A shitty little deal
17/10/2019, 11:09 - Rob;: A deal the then?
17/10/2019, 11:10 - David;: Don't get your hopes DUP
17/10/2019, 11:11 - Rob;: How different truly is this deal from the one Boris said would turn us into a vassal state?
17/10/2019, 11:12 - David;: Key point is it just applies to NI which he doesnt give a fuck about
17/10/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: Could make Belfast into an interesting place. Potential financial refuge for UK-facing companies that ‚ù§ EU/Petrol?
17/10/2019, 11:15 - David;: Also we can strike our own trade deals, which I know for you in particular Rob was a key concern
17/10/2019, 11:15 - Rob;: ‚ù§ trade deals
17/10/2019, 11:15 - David;: I ‚ù§ non-tariff barriers to trade
17/10/2019, 11:17 - Rob;: ‚ù§ custom checks in the Irish Sea
17/10/2019, 11:18 - David;: we should have a froust on the ferry over with lots of contraband and highly regulated commercial goods in our possession
17/10/2019, 11:18 - David;: The phytosanitary froust
17/10/2019, 11:19 - Rob;: I would love that
17/10/2019, 11:21 - Rob;: Have loads of animals with us that were raised to higher welfare standards
17/10/2019, 11:22 - David;: 'I'm sorry officer but this small rucksack is in fact entirely filled with nematicides that I intend on re-exporting to a third country via an intermediary in Dublin'.
17/10/2019, 12:13 - Paul;: So they should have gone for Mays deal? They created Boris and now he‚Äôs trolling
17/10/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: He's just turned up late and tweaked the work of someone less popular than him, then passed it off as his own good idea
17/10/2019, 12:15 - / James Ball: Very Tory
17/10/2019, 12:15 - Rob;: Like those confident people who just say your joke louder than you did and make the whole room laugh
17/10/2019, 12:15 - Paul;: But everyone saying this is worse than mays deal?
17/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: So he‚Äôs actually made it shitter
17/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: Not a better good idea
17/10/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: I think the Brexity people like it more
17/10/2019, 12:20 - David;: Don't see how it gets through parly still
17/10/2019, 12:20 - Jack G;: Maybe if they attach a reffy
17/10/2019, 12:21 - Rob;: Yeah, it's heading towards another delay, isn't it?
17/10/2019, 12:21 - David;: Because he's gone harder Brexit - the remain-leaning Tories who he kicked out are unlikely to go for it and without them he doesnt have a Majy even with the DUP
17/10/2019, 12:22 - David;: I suppose labour rebels might tip it through
17/10/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: There's that sect of unionist-supporting Tories who won't vote for it if the DUP don't, so it could be quite a lot less popular in parliament than May's deal
17/10/2019, 12:24 - David;: I think in practice they won't give a fuck now they've got their cunt in Downing street
17/10/2019, 12:24 - Jack G;: I think Boris is probably hoping it fails anyway. Plays into his Parliament vs people ploy
17/10/2019, 12:26 - David;: True, heading for a large Boris majy because he's consolidated the cunt vote.
17/10/2019, 12:28 - Jack G;: Farage hating this deal is a spanner in the works though
17/10/2019, 12:29 - Jack G;: Think Boris would have to campaign on no deal to get the cunt vote
17/10/2019, 12:36 - Rob;: Could be great if Nigel splits the cunt vote
17/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: Question is if it's rejected does he campaign on no deal or on this deal
17/10/2019, 12:53 - Jack G;: Yeah that‚Äôs a tricky one because if he gets a majy campaigning on this deal you‚Äôd assume he‚Äôd be able to get it through Parliament. He can‚Äôt say he‚Äôd go no deal if the deal doesn‚Äôt pass so no dealers will gravitate towards Farage
17/10/2019, 12:55 - David;: yes campaigning on this deal risks splitting cunt vote again while campaigning on no deal risks pushing moderate tories towards the lib dems

17/10/2019, 17:53 - Damian Rumble: Just got power back on my phone. Feeling pretty nervous about this whole brexit thing. Junker saying he will not give a brexit extension might just scare enough labour MPs into backing the deal for it to squeek  through
17/10/2019, 17:54 - Damian Rumble: Even if it doesn't Johnson will be able to go to the country to see. This is my deal. Vote for me to see it done. Can't see labour bearing that...
17/10/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: The worst thing is if Boris gets brexit done everyone will love him and we‚Äôll all be eating Tory shit for the next 10 years
17/10/2019, 18:04 - David;: Yeah exactly
17/10/2019, 18:05 - Phill: Can't wait.
17/10/2019, 18:05 - David;: Labour should have voted for Mays deal and argued over the shape of the future relationship without handing them their little betrayal narrative
17/10/2019, 18:06 - Damian Rumble: I mean that would have been the ultimate betrayal for many labour voters and driven them into the arms of the lib dems
17/10/2019, 18:07 - Damian Rumble: But by not voting for it Boris will paint them as enemies of the people

17/10/2019, 19:16 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs the modern way. Sporting director to manage scouts, decide what kind of players you want and how the team should play. Coach to implement the vision and motivate the team

18/10/2019, 08:44 - Rob;: I have literally just finished months of working on Christmas projects
18/10/2019, 08:45 - Rob;: Up for binning if off from here
18/10/2019, 08:45 - David;: But now you have to live it all again in real life
18/10/2019, 08:46 - David;: So you get about 6 months of Christmas?
18/10/2019, 08:47 - Rob;: Roughly
18/10/2019, 08:48 - Rob;: From now to November 1st are my least christmassy weeks of the period
18/10/2019, 08:49 - Rob;: Obviously the corporate, tacky elements of Christmas are worth avoiding, but in its basic form it's good: an increased chance of seeing friends, fires, over-eating and over-drinking become the norm, time off
18/10/2019, 08:49 - Rob;: It's the natural season of froust, if you want it
18/10/2019, 08:49 - Rob;: I believe John Lennon said that

18/10/2019, 09:12 - David;: The 5th dynasty ruler of Egypt King Sahure recorded the earliest attested expedition to the land of Punt, modern day Horn of Africa particularly Somalia which brought back large quantities of myrrh, frankincense, malachite and electrum. Other products that were also brought back included wild animals, particularly cheetahs, the secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius), giraffes and Hamadryas baboons (which was sacred to the Ancient Egyptians), ebony, ivory and animal skins.
18/10/2019, 09:13 - David;: >the secretary bird
18/10/2019, 09:28 - Rob;: My secretary bird will call you with the details
18/10/2019, 09:29 - Paul;: Ah that‚Äôs ruined me
18/10/2019, 09:30 - Paul;: I‚Äôll have my secretary bird book it for us
18/10/2019, 09:43 - Rob;: >having an affair with your secretary bird
18/10/2019, 09:54 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 09:55 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 10:04 - Rob;: Legs up to her arse
18/10/2019, 10:07 - Paul;: Very female Damian bird
18/10/2019, 10:09 - Rob;: A lot more chic that I imagine Damian as a bird
18/10/2019, 10:52 - Damian Rumble: I can only aspire to this bird...
18/10/2019, 11:13 - David;: Gyimah's out. Grievesy's out
18/10/2019, 11:15 - David;: DUP lobbying against
18/10/2019, 11:19 - Damian Rumble: Gyimah is a LD of course he is out
18/10/2019, 11:20 - Damian Rumble: It's the yellow bellyed labour MPs you've got to watch out for
18/10/2019, 11:21 - Jack G;: A lot of MPs realising this deal can just be used as a stepping stone to no deal
18/10/2019, 11:22 - Hamish Sinclair: With predominantly leave voting constituencies
18/10/2019, 11:24 - David;: Although even within leave seats labour voters are majority remain
18/10/2019, 11:26 - Damian Rumble: How so?
18/10/2019, 11:26 - Jack G;: The transition period I believe is only 6 months and needs to be extended if we haven‚Äôt agreed a new deal. This is just the withdrawal agreement
18/10/2019, 11:27 - Paul;: 2 years transition period
18/10/2019, 11:27 - Damian Rumble: Wasn't it until the end of 2020?
18/10/2019, 11:28 - Jack G;: Think it runs out 31/12/2020
18/10/2019, 11:28 - Jack G;: And if we want to extend that has to be done by July
18/10/2019, 11:29 - Paul;: One you have deal agreed you get 2 years before it becomes permanent so you can sort out all the infrastructure etc
18/10/2019, 11:30 - Paul;: Think that 2020 one relates to the original date in March
18/10/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: Really? I thought the 2020 date stood despite the extension
18/10/2019, 11:32 - Paul;: Hmmm dunno
18/10/2019, 12:27 - Paul;: YouGov snap poll
18/10/2019, 14:02 - Jack G;: Big day tomorrow. Rugby quarter finals, premier league is back, then a showdown in the commons
18/10/2019, 14:11 - Damian Rumble: I'm going to the march to parliament tomorrow. Will be literally outside ready to kick off if it goes through.
18/10/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: If they vote no deal then he has to extend no?
18/10/2019, 14:13 - David;: He has to ask for one
18/10/2019, 14:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Would love to see it passed providing it goes back to a referendum
18/10/2019, 14:13 - Rob;: Election at the same time as extension request, right?
18/10/2019, 14:13 - David;: Juncker has indicated the EU will not approve it. However that may be simply political to put more pressure on mps and increase likelihood of it passing
18/10/2019, 14:13 - Rob;: Otherwise what cganges
18/10/2019, 14:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Gagging for a confirmatory referendum
18/10/2019, 14:15 - Jack G;: I think that has been taken out of context by the media. He simply said why would we need an extension, we have a deal
18/10/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: Yeah, it was a response to a question in a press scrum, rather than a formal statement
18/10/2019, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: Yeah it's not Junker's choice anyway. I'm sure messers Macron and Merkel would prefer an extension over a no deal
18/10/2019, 14:41 - David;: No he ruled it out quite explicitly - but yes not his choice it's the Council

18/10/2019, 15:09 - David;: Would be a great troll for Sinn Fein to suddenly take seats and vote it down then quit again.
18/10/2019, 15:09 - Jack G;: Surely they‚Äôd vote for it though as it makes Irish reunification more likely
18/10/2019, 19:48 - Paul;: His wife was furious when she found out he had been having an affair with his secretary bird
18/10/2019, 23:46 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50103450
18/10/2019, 23:47 - David;: Hib
19/10/2019, 08:15 - Damian Rumble: Just a small amount of rugby today then..
19/10/2019, 08:16 - Jack G;: Need to get off to a decent start and stop any thoughts of an Aussie win in their tracks
19/10/2019, 10:49 - Paul;: Liking the win then?
19/10/2019, 11:00 - David;: Make the ball round then get back to me
19/10/2019, 11:22 - Damian Rumble: Cracking win. Looking like we could be in with a chance for the world cup if we keep playing like that
19/10/2019, 12:17 - David;: All the people with yarmolenko getting trolled
19/10/2019, 12:18 - Jack G;: Could have predicted it. Played both matches for Ukraine
19/10/2019, 12:42 - Damian Rumble: Ireland looking really bad
19/10/2019, 12:43 - Phill: >all those smelly remainers outside parliament
19/10/2019, 12:44 - Damian Rumble: Heading down there after the match
19/10/2019, 12:44 - Damian Rumble: Remain or no deal
19/10/2019, 12:45 - Phill: Says a lot that you prioritised the Ireland New Zealand match above your politics
19/10/2019, 12:45 - Phill: Smelly fickle remainer
19/10/2019, 12:47 - Damian Rumble: Don't worry Phil. I'll be there for the votes later on.
19/10/2019, 12:48 - David;: Jaaack
19/10/2019, 12:55 - David;: Lanzini appears to be a heap of shit
19/10/2019, 12:55 - Paul;: I blame you entirely for that jack
19/10/2019, 12:56 - Paul;: Once more I listened to your advice and it yielded nothing but complete shit
19/10/2019, 12:59 - David;: Could just have fish and chips for lunch
19/10/2019, 13:02 - David;: 'feet are an important part of football' - Chris Sutton

19/10/2019, 14:55 - Phill: Lol Boris just saying he's not even going to bother seeking an extension
19/10/2019, 14:56 - Jack G;: Admitting he‚Äôs going to break the law, great move Boris
19/10/2019, 15:06 - Paul;: Why do they want a delay? What are they hoping to gain after so many other delays?
19/10/2019, 15:14 - David;: On the ball a lot, looking dangerous
19/10/2019, 15:15 - David;: This has just confirmed my opinion
19/10/2019, 15:16 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I'm entirely sure what this achieves. Just more time for Boris to win over support with possible ramifications for not send a letter
19/10/2019, 15:18 - David;: Hib. Spurs
19/10/2019, 15:19 - David;: They really have become a heap of shit
19/10/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: Just the universe being restored to normal order
19/10/2019, 15:20 - David;: Yeah with west ham losing again as well
19/10/2019, 15:21 - Jack G;: Exactly
19/10/2019, 15:32 - David;: What's Webster?
19/10/2019, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Webster, 20m from bristol city I think. Better than Duffy, worse than dunk
19/10/2019, 15:37 - David;: Lol the centre back index
19/10/2019, 15:38 - David;: Ah. Moy
19/10/2019, 15:38 - David;: Oh Mooy god
19/10/2019, 16:23 - Phill: Does Swinson realise she's wearing union jack earrings?
19/10/2019, 18:28 - Paul;: Bets on with what boris does re sending a letter?
19/10/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Writes it, but in his own shit
19/10/2019, 18:34 - Jack G;: He‚Äôll get someone else to write it on his behalf

19/10/2019, 18:54 - Phill: Yeah looks great

19/10/2019, 19:01 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
19/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Very rare not to have the ingredients in
19/10/2019, 22:29 - David;: Lol watching the Diego maradonna film.
19/10/2019, 22:29 - David;: He was completely absurd
19/10/2019, 23:44 - David;: Dat Watford goal. The quintessential 4-4-2 goals
20/10/2019, 09:00 - Phill: Big game today

20/10/2019, 17:12 - Paul;: Man U bribed the ref again
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Jack G;: Currently the equivalent of us getting hyped up for a match against spurs
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: I üíì VAR
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: Obvious hand ball
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Obvious foul. Obvious handball
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: Exactly what VAR is there for
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Sam;: Never a foul
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Sure sure
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Sam;: Irrelevant anyway as his first touch was so heavy
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Hamish Sinclair: üßê
20/10/2019, 17:15 - David;: Football ruined. Next
20/10/2019, 17:16 - Paul;: Liverpool 0 VAR 2
20/10/2019, 17:16 - Hamish Sinclair: No issue with VAR, just terrible refereeing
20/10/2019, 17:16 - Hamish Sinclair: An old school gripe if you will
20/10/2019, 18:20 - David;: Brandon Williams
20/10/2019, 18:20 - David;: Obviousky
20/10/2019, 18:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Great point that
20/10/2019, 18:24 - David;: Yeah. Great result given the performance and context
20/10/2019, 18:24 - David;: Could be crucial
20/10/2019, 19:15 - David;: https://youtu.be/zcNM0mph_b0
20/10/2019, 19:18 - David;: Refs got a couple of yellows to be giving out there. A caution or two
20/10/2019, 19:21 - Paul;: That knockout kick
20/10/2019, 19:22 - David;: Yeah lol at the ends, studs up full into the back

21/10/2019, 15:55 - Damian Rumble: The ultimate troll
21/10/2019, 15:58 - Jack G;: Don‚Äôt know what the government were expecting, he‚Äôs just following normal parliamentary procedure

21/10/2019, 20:16 - David;: How far were you off the Isthmian south east at Chippy Sam?
21/10/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: The pinotphiles - a group of light wine lovers
21/10/2019, 20:30 - David;: Lol
21/10/2019, 20:30 - David;: The speedophiles
21/10/2019, 20:30 - David;: Men's swimwear association
21/10/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: The pedophiles. We're just really into feet
21/10/2019, 20:32 - David;: Ah, Robert. That's for mousset that
21/10/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: Not a fan of that
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: That looked very penno
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: The pennophiles
21/10/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Hi I‚Äôm a pennophile
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: Probably what the VAT team refer to themselves as
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: *VAR
21/10/2019, 20:38 - David;: What's the point of Xhaka really?
21/10/2019, 21:17 - David;: Basham, Baldock, Egan and Fleck
21/10/2019, 21:18 - David;: Very Rohl Dahl defence
21/10/2019, 21:26 - David;: Hmm Rob the Aubameyang hat trick I've been counting doesn't look imminent
21/10/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: I'm in need of that too
21/10/2019, 21:29 - David;: I'm mean you'd want a little mesut in this scenario
21/10/2019, 21:30 - David;: A world class playmaker who can unlock a defence
21/10/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: Best to let him rot
21/10/2019, 21:31 - David;: This is very Phil football manager strategy. Benching your best player out of spite
21/10/2019, 21:33 - Rob;: It's been a long road to get to this point, with Ozil contributing massively with his lack of application, but yeah, Emery has made it much worse than it needs to be
21/10/2019, 21:34 - Rob;: Not even putting him the squad is mad
21/10/2019, 21:34 - Rob;: Guess he would have been sold had anyone been interested
21/10/2019, 21:36 - David;: Yeah if you don't sell him you have to at least try to reintegrate even as a bench option surely
21/10/2019, 21:36 - David;: You're paying his wages either way
21/10/2019, 21:37 - Rob;: It's not like he wouldn't add something late on, even if he's not in your plans from the start
21/10/2019, 21:38 - Sam;: Isthmian top devision is level 8 on the pyramid, Witney and district premier division is level 13.
21/10/2019, 21:41 - David;: They could be there in 5 promotions
21/10/2019, 21:41 - David;: It galls me that my current team aren't on the pyramid. I just want to be at the bottom of a pyramid gazing up at the stars
21/10/2019, 21:42 - Paul;: You should sweep in and become manager. Your real life footy man
21/10/2019, 21:43 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/10/2019, 21:44 - David;: Our manager is a fat piece of shit. Temmy.
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Temmy
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Old tem
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Tembo
21/10/2019, 21:44 - David;: Tembo
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Mr tembo
21/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: He's from the dark ages. His management is mainly based around shouting
21/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: And dying for the 3 points
21/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Does that not get you motivated to die?
21/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Are they suspicious of you as part of the intelligentsia?
21/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: We won 5-1 at the weekend when he wasn't there. Not a coincidence
21/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: Nah I'm the silky wide forward they've been craving. 2 assists at the weekend
21/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: You do the maths
21/10/2019, 21:56 - Paul;: Silky
21/10/2019, 21:57 - Paul;: Which footballer do they compare you to?
21/10/2019, 22:09 - David;: I would compare myself to a young xerdan shaqiri. Haven't seen anyone else making the comparison
21/10/2019, 22:16 - Rob;: Are you therefore the Messi of the Alps of the Cotswolds?
21/10/2019, 22:18 - David;: Yeah but playing in the Lothian east league
21/10/2019, 22:19 - David;: So the Messi of the Alps of the Cotswolds of east lothian
22/10/2019, 09:13 - Rob;: Bag of bags, king of kings
22/10/2019, 09:15 - Damian Rumble: Can't remember the last game week where my highest scoring player was a mid field clean sheet. What a cluster fuck
22/10/2019, 14:16 - Paul;: Could get a genny
22/10/2019, 14:16 - Paul;: A lovely Christmas genny
22/10/2019, 14:16 - Jack G;: Yeah seems inevitable now
22/10/2019, 15:11 - Damian Rumble: Yeah this vote today on timings has become a proxy for the meaningful vote
22/10/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: Who‚Äôs hoping for a genny
22/10/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: Get my genny ready
22/10/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
22/10/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: Like the world cup for politics
22/10/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Doesn't come round enough, even in recent times
22/10/2019, 17:10 - Damian Rumble: The biggest unknown is how the public will react to having brexit delayed. Will they punish to pm breaking his promise or will they go with his line that parliament has betrayed the 'will of the people'
22/10/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: I bet things come out even more divided that at present
22/10/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: 5 parties with identical numbers of MPs. You heard it here first
22/10/2019, 17:13 - Rob;: Leaving Plaid Cymru as the kingmakers
22/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: Fuck em. We‚Äôve just got to battle the leave voters and get a 2nd ref. The people are the enemy of the people. Brown vs Brown.
22/10/2019, 17:18 - Rob;: Labour need to be brave and go for referendum in a direct and unqualified way, or the chance of that is nothing
22/10/2019, 17:18 - Jack G;: A single issue genny is such a shitstorm
22/10/2019, 17:19 - Jack G;: Would be great to have a genny and reffy at the same time
22/10/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: You could probably sweep some controversial shit underneath a big brexit promise
22/10/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: *WE'LL REMAIN IN THE EU*
*but Corbyn gets a crack on your missus
22/10/2019, 17:29 - David;: Like how the will of the people is used to justify stopping the people expressing their will again
22/10/2019, 17:30 - David;: That's essentially exactly what Johnson will do though. "Get Brexit Done". (By the way we're now Singapore.)
22/10/2019, 17:31 - Jack G;: Don‚Äôt forget selling the NHS to America
22/10/2019, 17:32 - Damian Rumble: Being an autocratic, highly deregulated, serviced based single party state has got to be a Tories wet dream...
22/10/2019, 17:34 - David;: Dont think tories are aware that Singapore's political economy revolves around state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds. Haven't seen that detail mentioned very much.
22/10/2019, 17:34 - David;: And yes single party rule and cronyism
22/10/2019, 19:18 - Phill: D-d-d-dealll

22/10/2019, 19:20 - Jack G;: Next vote is the important one
22/10/2019, 19:21 - Phill: Why tho? This vote now means there will be this deal at some point, be it the 31st or later
22/10/2019, 19:21 - Jack G;: Boris has said he‚Äôll pull the bill if they vote down the programme motion (next vote)
22/10/2019, 19:21 - Paul;: Majjy
22/10/2019, 19:22 - Phill: Nah he won't
22/10/2019, 19:22 - Paul;: Who‚Äôs suffering from the most butthurt in the thread at the moment?
22/10/2019, 19:22 - Phill: Damo is probably dead from it
22/10/2019, 19:23 - Phill: There's not enough sudocreme in the world
22/10/2019, 19:24 - Phill: I just realised that I have sustained a troll leave position for over 3 years now
22/10/2019, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Oh I actually had just assumed you were vote leave
22/10/2019, 19:25 - Phill: Lol I voted remain and labour last 2 votes
22/10/2019, 19:26 - Jack G;: Phil the Corbynista
22/10/2019, 19:26 - Phill: It's just been a great little troll niche
22/10/2019, 19:27 - Paul;: Am I unlikely to get my genny now?
22/10/2019, 19:27 - Phill: No Genny. Full Boris term if he delivers Brexit.
22/10/2019, 19:29 - Phill: Would just vote green in the next Genny anyway unless Kier Starmer was labour leader.
22/10/2019, 19:34 - Jack G;: Government loss on programme motion then
22/10/2019, 19:34 - Jack G;: Boris will be butthurt he can‚Äôt ram the deal through in 3 days
22/10/2019, 19:37 - Paul;: No deal incoming
22/10/2019, 19:41 - Jack G;: Nah eu will give us an extension then a genny
22/10/2019, 19:42 - Paul;: Nah cliff edge imminent
22/10/2019, 19:47 - Paul;: Main point is everyone is loving the deal so that‚Äôs what we get now? Or they can still chuck it after debating it
22/10/2019, 19:48 - Jack G;: I think they don‚Äôt mind it but the want parliament to have a larger say in shaping the future relationship
22/10/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: What would happen in a genny? Labour destroyed?
22/10/2019, 20:04 - David;: Most likely
22/10/2019, 20:06 - David;: Surely they'll just go for short extension now 10-15 days to get the legy passes
22/10/2019, 20:06 - David;: *passed
22/10/2019, 20:07 - Paul;: The leggy
22/10/2019, 20:07 - David;: Yeah get legy passed ahead of genny to secure majy
22/10/2019, 20:07 - Damian Rumble: Butt levels remain nominal. Good to see a solid 322 MPs resisting the pm brexit tom-foolery
22/10/2019, 20:09 - Phill: Ju lost doe.
22/10/2019, 20:10 - Damian Rumble: A short technical extension would be most sensible for boris. Want but he will have to fight MPs every step of the way. It would be easier to get a long delay. Crush labour and then sail through any Brexit he wants with a large majority
22/10/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: Chances of EU trolling us and saying no extension?
22/10/2019, 20:15 - Jack G;: Highly unlikely. They wouldn‚Äôt want to be blamed for no deal
22/10/2019, 20:22 - Paul;: Why would they care
22/10/2019, 20:23 - David;: Dat German export industry to answer to
22/10/2019, 20:23 - David;: Dem interest groups
22/10/2019, 20:25 - David;: Dat domestic euroscepticism
22/10/2019, 20:25 - Paul;: If I was eu I‚Äôd be trolling
22/10/2019, 20:26 - David;: Are EU having a laugh?
22/10/2019, 21:04 - Paul;: Exit my brexit
22/10/2019, 21:06 - Phill: He's got a foot like an opposition amendment
23/10/2019, 14:09 - Damian Rumble: @447540496004 how butt hurt will be if the cliff edge gets pushed back until the end of Jan?
23/10/2019, 14:10 - David;: >'@447540496004'
23/10/2019, 14:25 - Rob;: How butt hurt will be
23/10/2019, 14:27 - Paul;: @447969894197 are you asking @447854020575 re @447770604623 re @447540496004 or just @447540496004 or via @447854020575 c/o @447540496004 ?
23/10/2019, 15:27 - Jack G;: He already let the cat out the bag. A three year troll so doubt he‚Äôd be butthurt

24/10/2019, 19:19 - Rob;: Apparently the reason he gets it cut like that even though he's a billionaire is because he's obsessed with Julius Caesar

24/10/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: So there you go, looks like a weird little McLovin gremlin because he styles himself on a Roman emperor

25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: Seems so
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: So he still doesn't have a goal from open play
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: The second kick is brilliant
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: The first more him taking advance of bad keeping
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: But it will do the boy no end of good to have won the game for us
25/10/2019, 12:13 - David;: The boy pepe

25/10/2019, 20:06 - Rob;: Found out with 15 mins to spare
25/10/2019, 20:19 - David;: Lol Southampton fans leaving. 17 minutes played
25/10/2019, 20:27 - Phill: Tfw no goals or assists in a rout
25/10/2019, 20:28 - David;: Yeah maddison managing to stay well away from any goal involvement
25/10/2019, 20:28 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/10/2019, 20:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Fuck!
25/10/2019, 20:42 - Rob;: Like McGinn when Villa won 5-1
25/10/2019, 20:42 - Rob;: Impossible not to get more than 2 points as an attacker in that scenario
25/10/2019, 20:43 - David;: Still nothing on the grapevine from Maddison
25/10/2019, 20:43 - David;: No goals no assists
25/10/2019, 21:21 - David;: Southamptons next 2 games both against City
25/10/2019, 21:21 - David;: Good way to get your confidence back
25/10/2019, 21:22 - Paul;: Buy city bonds
25/10/2019, 21:26 - David;: Jack with his little Tielemans
25/10/2019, 21:37 - Jack G;: Just seen the result (seven). Quite the right Tielemans
25/10/2019, 21:39 - David;: Maddison still no assists no goals
25/10/2019, 21:40 - Paul;: Good to get the clean sheet though
25/10/2019, 21:40 - David;: Still not a result
25/10/2019, 21:41 - Jack G;: Surely losing by 7 at home should be automatic relegation
25/10/2019, 21:42 - Jack G;: Madison goal Dave
25/10/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Madison's square garden
25/10/2019, 21:43 - David;: Ah there he is
25/10/2019, 21:43 - David;: Just as I stopped watching I disgust
25/10/2019, 21:43 - Jack G;: Who assisted

25/10/2019, 22:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, so the friday game stopped me making my sub which was going to be getting rid of jamie vardy
25/10/2019, 22:18 - David;: You've done well out of that
25/10/2019, 22:18 - David;: One paltry goal from a 9-0 win.

27/10/2019, 13:55 - Rob;: Where are you getting your bureaucratic edits of the Phantom Menace?
27/10/2019, 13:56 - David;: Does Facebook still exist or has everyone finally got bored of it

27/10/2019, 18:16 - Hamish Sinclair: VAR OUT
27/10/2019, 18:16 - Paul;: Var
27/10/2019, 18:19 - Jack G;: No idea how they‚Äôve overturned that
27/10/2019, 18:24 - David;: It was a dangerous scoreline to get into
27/10/2019, 18:29 - David;: Lol guendouzi
27/10/2019, 18:29 - David;: No red for that
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: Seems lik goals are now presumed disallowed until proven innocent
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: This could be Emery gone perhaps
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Surely not midseason though?
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Paul;: Is moyes looking for a new job?
27/10/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: I do think our board are particularly passive and worried about change, but it seems like a situation that just won't get better. Hard to see what Emery's trying to do.
27/10/2019, 18:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Other than play as many young players as possible
27/10/2019, 18:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Who's out there as a replacement though?
27/10/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Which has been about the only posistive
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Well Moyes is free, as Paul suggested
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Yeah I don't think it's a good time to find a good manager, which probably means they won't do it
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: But this less fun than I think any point under Wenger
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Paul;: Would you like a moyes?
27/10/2019, 18:58 - Paul;: A cheeky moyes
27/10/2019, 18:58 - David;: Big Sam's out of work still
27/10/2019, 18:58 - Rob;: Warnock. He'd make them all die for three points
27/10/2019, 18:58 - Jack G;: Do a Man U/Chelsea and give it to Ljungberg
27/10/2019, 18:58 - Rob;: Caretaker Freddie
27/10/2019, 18:58 - David;: You've got to die for three points
27/10/2019, 18:59 - David;: No survivors should remain after any game
27/10/2019, 18:59 - David;: Henry? Just for a laugh
27/10/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: Perfect premier League record, 38 wins, 418 played used. No survivors
27/10/2019, 19:00 - Rob;: I think Henry burn his bridges a bit when he turn down a coaching role because he didn't want to stop doing sky sports
27/10/2019, 19:01 - David;: Also his only managerial stint being a catastrophe?
27/10/2019, 19:01 - Rob;: We said 'whiel you work for us, could you not go on TV and slag us off' and he said, 'nah, the slagging off is very important to me'
27/10/2019, 19:01 - Rob;: Yes, that too
27/10/2019, 19:01 - David;: Where is your Lampard?
27/10/2019, 19:01 - David;: What's viera up to
27/10/2019, 19:01 - Rob;: Where's Vieira now, new York?
27/10/2019, 19:02 - David;: Bergkamp?
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Bergkamp
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Yeh
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Big brain on him
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: But flightless
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: The penguin
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Paul;: ?
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Ljungberg or Arteta probably the mostly likely ex players
27/10/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: He's the non-flying Dutchman Paul
27/10/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: Won't get on a plane

27/10/2019, 19:15 - David;: I'd love to see Pulis work with this group of players
27/10/2019, 19:18 - David;: You're still 5th somehow
27/10/2019, 19:18 - David;: Maybe everything's fine
27/10/2019, 19:30 - Rob;: Yeah nothing's lost, Emery is just very hard to like
27/10/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: But you really want Wenger back
27/10/2019, 19:43 - David;: Is Wenger in work?
27/10/2019, 19:43 - David;: Didn't he get a big gig in japan
27/10/2019, 19:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Arteta surely your best bet
27/10/2019, 19:45 - David;: Wenger's groundbreaking contribution to the English game was telling the players not to gorge on chips and pies
27/10/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: Would everyone be on chips and pies still if not for him?
27/10/2019, 19:46 - David;: Yeah, they would never have been advised otherwise
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Rob;: Wenger has been writing his book and not managing
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Rob;: Japan or France if he gets another job I guess
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Paul;: Is it coming out on audible ?
27/10/2019, 19:47 - David;: Does he explain the no chip philosophy?
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Paul;: Read by him
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Rob;: I imagine it's all about Mars bars start to finish
27/10/2019, 19:48 - David;: I want massive detail about diet and habits of Parlour et al circa 1994
27/10/2019, 19:49 - David;: Volume of chips consumed etc.
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: I mean the shitty books by the players of that era have all that
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: What‚Äôs the shittest footy book you‚Äôve read?
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: The Perry Groves book is where that 'I shagged her, then Merse shagged her, then I shagged her again, then Tony shagged' anecdote
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: Probably that one
27/10/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: I tried to read Jamie Vardy's after I got a free copy, but butter my arse it was shit
27/10/2019, 19:50 - David;: And the British Library and bodleon have to store a copy of that
27/10/2019, 19:50 - David;: By law
27/10/2019, 19:51 - Paul;: Lol the volume of other shit books they‚Äôll have as well
27/10/2019, 19:51 - David;: Yeah all the Katie price books
27/10/2019, 19:51 - David;: More celeb bios than Plato and Aristotle combined, by far
27/10/2019, 19:52 - Rob;: There'll be a point of impossibility though surely, unless they dig down into the Earth's core to keep storing
27/10/2019, 19:52 - Rob;: Celeb books at the top, Greek philosophy at the bottom
27/10/2019, 19:52 - David;: They pretty much are they store it in a massive underground vault
27/10/2019, 19:54 - David;: Be good if the philosophy and science sections got wiped out in the nuclear war so we were left to rebuild only with the knowledge from celeb bios
27/10/2019, 19:54 - David;: The only section that was left intact
27/10/2019, 19:55 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
27/10/2019, 19:58 - Rob;: Learning to farm again from Paul Burrell's A ROYAL DUTY
27/10/2019, 20:10 - David;: Divining the principles of cosmology from Lee Howey's "Massively Violent and Decidedly Average"
28/10/2019, 08:57 - Paul;: Mark Lacey at the Star Trek convention
28/10/2019, 08:57 - Paul;: One thing I notice is they still use the same horrible background boards for the pictures that were used in the 80s
28/10/2019, 10:03 - Damian Rumble: Pics or it didn't happen
28/10/2019, 10:19 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 14:35 - / James Ball: I don't know who half of those people are
28/10/2019, 14:36 - Rob;: One of them is Mark Lacey in every photo so I know exactly 50%
28/10/2019, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: I am considering it to be very life affirming that I don't know these people
28/10/2019, 14:43 - Phill: He's definitely a pedo
28/10/2019, 15:06 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 15:07 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 15:14 - Paul;: Rob what abusing did you do to Ramsay and his family?
28/10/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: Never gave them a minute's rest
28/10/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: I personally called his mum a berk
28/10/2019, 15:15 - Paul;: Would you agree you‚Äôve become toxic?
28/10/2019, 15:16 - Rob;: To an extent, yes. There are a lot of wankers in the crowd who get on players' backs too easily
28/10/2019, 15:17 - Rob;: I haven't been to a league game yet this season, only to cup wins, and those have been pretty laid back and fun, but the league games were often a bit edgy last season
28/10/2019, 15:18 - Jack G;: Sack Emery, Rafa in
28/10/2019, 15:22 - Paul;: You need the banana shirt if you‚Äôre to fix this
28/10/2019, 15:27 - David;: The bruised banana could have been a unifying moment
28/10/2019, 15:43 - Paul;: Also generating cash
28/10/2019, 20:31 - Paul;: What happens now
28/10/2019, 20:31 - Paul;: My genny
28/10/2019, 22:41 - / James Ball: Bojo finds a ditch and a razor blade?
29/10/2019, 07:16 - Rob;: Delicious https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/u-k-to-destroy-commemorative-50p-coins-in-brexit-meltdown
29/10/2019, 07:36 - Damian Rumble: Hubris
29/10/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Your little genny, Paul
29/10/2019, 11:44 - Jack G;: Christmas genny
29/10/2019, 11:45 - Paul;: Is it certain?
29/10/2019, 11:46 - Paul;: Labour want EU citizens to vote?!
29/10/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: Labour, Lib Dems, SNPs and Tories all want one and the next motion being tabled only needs 50% support not two thirds
29/10/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: EU citizens in Britain only obvs
29/10/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Not all 500,000
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Damian Rumble: Time to start planning the election night blootfest
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: *500,000,000
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Jack G;: Also they want 16 year olds to vote
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: It's the day after my work Christmas party. Going to be quite a gritty little vote
29/10/2019, 11:50 - Stefan;: The guardian is reporting that none of Labour's conditions are actually red lines for them
29/10/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Do 16 year olds actually have time to get registered, realistically
29/10/2019, 11:51 - Jack G;: Need about 3 weeks for registration? So they‚Äôd have to sort it soonish
29/10/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: Looks to be about 1.5 million of them. That is a lot of work
29/10/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: Surely it‚Äôs a mental idea?
29/10/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: How is that even a realistic idea to have EU people voting in the uk?
29/10/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: Do you just turn up on the day
29/10/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: A quick Google suggests it's about 3.5 million people (Incl children), which seems like quite a lot
29/10/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: So potential 5 million more votes than normal
29/10/2019, 11:59 - Paul;: They‚Äôve run out of ideas
29/10/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: I think it's sensible to let this demographics have a say in Brexit, but the referendum would have been a much better time to introduce, when there was time to implement it
29/10/2019, 12:15 - Paul;: Why does everyone say December is complete madness?
29/10/2019, 12:15 - Paul;: What month do they want
29/10/2019, 12:19 - Damian Rumble: It's cold init
29/10/2019, 12:19 - Rob;: Normally they are held in late spring with the idea that favourable weather will boost turn out
29/10/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: And everyone's doing endless nativity plays in all of the village halls and primary schools that get used for poll stations
29/10/2019, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: The bodies of old, grey Tory voters will like up in the streets after they die from exposure whilst trying to vote
29/10/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: So many school plays you can't elect a government
29/10/2019, 12:21 - Stefan;: There's so many practical problems with a winter election
29/10/2019, 12:22 - Stefan;: Like polling staff having to sit for 16 hours in unheated churches and village halls
29/10/2019, 12:22 - Stefan;: Transporting ballot boxes across rural constituencies at night in ice/snow
29/10/2019, 12:23 - Stefan;: Also it'll lower turnout, which is more likely to hurt labour
29/10/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: And the school plays, Stefan
29/10/2019, 12:24 - Phill: Why is everyone so butthurt about the 12th of December but thirsting for the 9th?
29/10/2019, 12:24 - Damian Rumble: Throw the children bout on the cold winter streets I say. If you don't eat your meat how can you have your democracy?
29/10/2019, 12:27 - Rob;: Student vote. Apparently the 12 is just after they all go home, and they're more likely to be registered at uni
29/10/2019, 12:27 - Rob;: Which obviously doesn't worry the Tories at all
29/10/2019, 12:30 - Rob;: But why the students are apparently there on a Monday and gone by Thursday, I don't know
29/10/2019, 12:30 - Rob;: Term ends on a Friday, surely
29/10/2019, 12:36 - Stefan;: Some say the student vote would help Labour more in their parents' marginal constituencies than in university towns, which are mostly safe Labour seats already
29/10/2019, 12:37 - Stefan;: (That's if they're registered at home and actually vote)
29/10/2019, 12:37 - David;: Depends on demographics. If it's Al the frail old racists put off by the cold won't it weaken Tory vote?
29/10/2019, 12:37 - Sam;: Such fake news rob. Its to do with the 25 days of prorogument required in the run up to a genny.
29/10/2019, 12:39 - Damian Rumble: I imagine that when the students leave their campuses they will probably just retreat into thier parents houses for the winter and not bother voting at all
29/10/2019, 12:42 - David;: Genny is a perfect defroust though
29/10/2019, 12:42 - Stefan;: I think it's more than old people vote reliably out of habit, whereas younger people are more casual/less committed (so more likely not to bother if it's cold and dark)
29/10/2019, 12:43 - Stefan;: I'll be doing an all-night froust at the Hackney count in some cold sports hall
29/10/2019, 12:44 - David;: Go with a duvet and lots of Pringles and doughnuts
29/10/2019, 12:44 - David;: Just bed down
29/10/2019, 12:45 - Phill: This argument is so bullshit. If a party can't inspire people to go and vote then they don't deserve the vote. You can't be butthurt if Tory voters are more engaged in politics. Fucking engage if you so mad.
29/10/2019, 12:46 - David;: It's not lack of engagement it's that people that age have jobs, children, commitments vs retired people who sit on their arse all day just waiting for a genny. Election is a nice little outing for diedrie.
29/10/2019, 12:47 - David;: And have all day to do it, not rushing to get it in after work/school run etc.
29/10/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Which bit is fake news?
29/10/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Not the bit about nativity plays
29/10/2019, 12:58 - Phill: This is fake news. Polling stations open into the evening. If they bother to vote then don't moan.
29/10/2019, 12:58 - Phill: Don't bother*
29/10/2019, 13:00 - Sam;: The choice between the 9th or  12th of Dec that Phil asked about
29/10/2019, 13:04 - Damian Rumble: The irony of Phil willing people to engage in politics and simultaneously trolling anyone and everyone who publicly expresses and engagement in politics
29/10/2019, 13:08 - Rob;: I see. About the 9th not giving the government time to bring it's brexit deal back. I hadn't read that. Had conflated the choice with the general objection to that week of December as it's end of uni terms
29/10/2019, 13:10 - Sam;: Unacceptable
29/10/2019, 13:10 - Stefan;: Yeah they don't trust Johnson not to reintroduce his Brexit bill if parliament is prorogued a few days later
29/10/2019, 13:16 - Paul;: Still not a confirmed genny though
29/10/2019, 13:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Playing the youth team
29/10/2019, 13:36 - Hamish Sinclair: You dont win anything with kids
29/10/2019, 14:39 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 14:40 - Rob;: Islamic State loves Ed
29/10/2019, 14:58 - Paul;: Now the genny is in doubt?
29/10/2019, 14:58 - Paul;: Surely kill off parliament and bring in Damian‚Äôs utopian computer
29/10/2019, 15:29 - Damian Rumble: All hail Colossus
29/10/2019, 15:40 - Paul;: Is that still your dream for a perfect system of government?
29/10/2019, 15:41 - Rob;: Who programs the computer? Right-wingers, left-wingers or centralists?
29/10/2019, 15:41 - Jack G;: We need to build a computer that will programme the computer
29/10/2019, 15:42 - Damian Rumble: Ideally yes
29/10/2019, 15:42 - Paul;: Have you not heard this explained before. Damian programmes it
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Paul;: In his fair society he‚Äôs actually a dictator
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Rob;: Oh ok then. I see no problems. Go ahead Damian
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Damian Rumble: A benevolent dictator
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Paul;: Damo is the closet dictator hiding as a liberal dem
29/10/2019, 15:44 - Damian Rumble: The catch is that I capture my conciousness in a computer but have any the emotion removed in the process
29/10/2019, 15:45 - Rob;: Isn't that the concept of a Dalek?
29/10/2019, 16:38 - / James Ball: Lord Rumble shows no empathy. Lord Rumble knows only pain
29/10/2019, 16:41 - David;: So you are arguing working age families do not have any additional commitments than retirees?
29/10/2019, 16:44 - David;: E.g. you have a 9-5.30 job and a commute, you then have to cook dinner for 2 children and get them into bed. You then have an event in the evening, or have booked in a dinner or film, or are just knackered. That is going to make a differenc at the margin to your willingness to
29/10/2019, 16:46 - David;: rush to a polling station by 9.30 or whenever they close. So that disproportionately lowers turnout for those voters vs retired people with an identical level of political knowledge/commitment/engagement.
29/10/2019, 17:07 - Rob;: Why is voting never considered for a Saturday? Because people are more likely to be away from their constituency?
29/10/2019, 17:07 - Paul;: Votey via posty?
29/10/2019, 17:08 - Paul;: Surely that‚Äôs a solution
29/10/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: Yeah, but it's the people who were definitely going to find a vote anyway that benefits
29/10/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: I've organised a vote via proxy twice, which was pretty easy, but you've got to be quite politically motivated in the first place
29/10/2019, 17:13 - Paul;: So how would you do it to make it fair?
29/10/2019, 17:14 - Jack G;: Offer online voting
29/10/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: Or a morning off/late start to allow people to vote
29/10/2019, 17:15 - Paul;: But jack all the old people who can‚Äôt use computers or people who don‚Äôt have them
29/10/2019, 17:16 - Jack G;: Yes but they vote in person already. Online is an easier option for people that can‚Äôt do that for whatever reason
29/10/2019, 17:16 - / James Ball: Online voting a terrible idea. Ripe for abuse
29/10/2019, 17:16 - Jack G;: Would probably also increase voter turnout
29/10/2019, 17:16 - / James Ball: Russians
29/10/2019, 17:16 - David;: Banky on the genny?
29/10/2019, 17:17 - Paul;: All the people with their holidays booked though
29/10/2019, 17:17 - David;: Schedule it really late so they don't have time to book anything up. Last minute genny banky
29/10/2019, 17:18 - Paul;: If they‚Äôre not cancelling their film night they‚Äôre not cancelling their banky holly
29/10/2019, 17:19 - David;: You're not cancelling a cinny visit to trudge to a polling station. National banky only option
29/10/2019, 17:20 - Paul;: 16yr olds too busy playing compy games don‚Äôt know what the libs are hoping for
29/10/2019, 17:21 - / James Ball: Not sure opening up to 16 year olds will make much difference
29/10/2019, 17:22 - David;: 1.5m 16-18s though
29/10/2019, 17:22 - / James Ball: Best to cap it instead. If you're likely to die within the next two terms you can't vote
29/10/2019, 17:23 - David;: Vote weighting by years left to death
29/10/2019, 17:23 - David;: I.e. you're going to be effected less over your remaining life course by the decisions taken
29/10/2019, 17:23 - / James Ball: Will they be motivated enough to register and turn out in time? At best a few hundred k teens
29/10/2019, 17:23 - / James Ball: Exactly
29/10/2019, 17:24 - / James Ball: Use UK average life expectancy. Set some median year as central point. Say 35? Everything scales from there
29/10/2019, 17:25 - / James Ball: If your current age exceeds UK average life expectancy then your vote weight tends to 0
29/10/2019, 17:26 - David;: JS mill proposed you get an extra vote if you have a degree.
29/10/2019, 17:29 - / James Ball: He obviously foresaw the brexit deadlock
29/10/2019, 17:29 - Rob;: The person of the median age gets to decide on their own
29/10/2019, 17:31 - / James Ball: The perfect median election. Decided by one man in Clitheroe who happened to be the exact median age of everyone in the country.
29/10/2019, 17:31 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
29/10/2019, 17:31 - Rob;: Maybe The Independent Party for Change will get in that way
29/10/2019, 17:49 - David;: >the mace
29/10/2019, 19:12 - Phill: If you cared about these so called children, you would get your arse down the polly
29/10/2019, 20:08 - Paul;: Oh no love island is on. Can‚Äôt cancel. Couldn‚Äôt possibly vote. - these are also the people you wouldn‚Äôt want voting anyway
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: Not sure if anyone has watched bake off this year. I've only seen about 3 episodes. My take home is that the fridge girl has an incredible aura of parental oppression
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: No detectable personality beyond fringe
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Ah fringe girl
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Not fridge girl
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Fridge girl is all personality
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: Forced to be an athlete, and now seemingly forced to be in bake off
29/10/2019, 20:20 - Rob;: Ah yeah, WhatsApp though I couldn't mean fringe
29/10/2019, 20:20 - Paul;: Great British wank off
29/10/2019, 20:20 - Rob;: That's on after 9
29/10/2019, 20:22 - Phill: There was a long group discussion at work today about men pissing on women for kicks
29/10/2019, 20:22 - Phill: Simon in the corner goes "my Mrs prefers the brown"
29/10/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: Ah
29/10/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: Just ventures that
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Rob;: Were other people admitting giving golden showers?
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Phill: This is the same guy that once regailed us the story of the time his wife tried to rape him with a dildo
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Phill: No.
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Rob;: Right, so no one had laid any ground work for his to say it
29/10/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Nah it was just piss banter flying around
29/10/2019, 20:26 - Rob;: The old I was raped banter
29/10/2019, 20:27 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 20:27 - Paul;: >looks set
29/10/2019, 20:28 - Phill: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 20:28 - Rob;: 438 votes to 20
29/10/2019, 20:29 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt wait for this genny
29/10/2019, 20:29 - Paul;: Going to destroy labour
29/10/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: I think it could prove hilariously inconclusive
29/10/2019, 20:31 - Phill: I bet ¬£10 on conservative majority
29/10/2019, 20:32 - Paul;: Conny majjy

29/10/2019, 20:33 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Con BXP coalition. I like my brexits hard and fast.
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Stefan;: Tory lead isn't nearly as big as it was then
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Stefan;: That said, it's not a given that Labour will pull off the same turnaround as in 2017
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Paul;: Everyone‚Äôs done with labour
29/10/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: And Boris will do better than May
29/10/2019, 20:35 - David;: Destroy a party already out of office? Pretty weak already.
29/10/2019, 20:35 - David;: They are famously not the government
29/10/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Just whinging little pricks though
29/10/2019, 20:39 - Paul;: Crimbo genny
29/10/2019, 20:40 - Paul;: Couldn‚Äôt be better
29/10/2019, 20:40 - David;: Boring. Predictable.

29/10/2019, 21:21 - Paul;: Nah. Where does that hit
29/10/2019, 21:21 - David;: Not a goal
29/10/2019, 21:21 - Rob;: Lol, the huge troll of the opposition scoring directly from it too
29/10/2019, 21:27 - Damian Rumble: Best odds for Tory majjy is 10/11

https://www.oddschecker.com/politics/british-politics/next-uk-general-election/overall-majority?selectionName=conservative-majority

29/10/2019, 21:31 - Damian Rumble: yeah that ¬£10 is not going to stretch far
29/10/2019, 21:33 - Phill: My face when the Tories win and we get an immediate hard brexit and Jo Swinson has a breakdown in the house of commons when the liberal elite realises they did this to themselves

30/10/2019, 12:29 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50229350
30/10/2019, 12:29 - David;: Lol this captaincy appointment
30/10/2019, 12:29 - David;: Very choice
30/10/2019, 12:39 - Rob;: Yeah, in juts a couple of weeks it went wrong in exactly the way that seemed obvious
30/10/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Don't appoint an unpopular player who suffers from lapses in concentration and moments of stupid aggression to be be your model of good judgement and commitment
30/10/2019, 12:44 - David;: Yeah just great how predictable it was and how instantly it has unravelled
30/10/2019, 12:44 - Rob;: Emery just not really getting things
30/10/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: Delaying the announcement of the captain, then saying he let the players vote on it
30/10/2019, 12:45 - David;: He seems somehow to be both very agressive and an extremely sensitive wallflower
30/10/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: Yeah
30/10/2019, 12:45 - David;: An unusual combination - thinned skinned agression
30/10/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: And it's not his fault he's picked every week and got made captain, but he just doesn't have the right qualities for either job
30/10/2019, 12:47 - Rob;: Apparently Emery doesn't fancy Torreira as he's not the 6ft hulk he'd preferred to has signed, but you'd have to think Guendouzi and Torreira would be better
30/10/2019, 12:48 - David;: Wasn't Torreira doing great last season? Why the sudden shunning
30/10/2019, 12:48 - David;: Thought he was the sucess story
30/10/2019, 12:49 - Rob;: Yep, loved him. Form dipped a bit later on, but everyone loves him
30/10/2019, 12:49 - Rob;: Mr Committment
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: Mr Dynamo
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: Mr Snappy Snap
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: But he's now exiled?
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: Yep, best to bench that
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: Get rid of that.
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: Along with Ozil
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: The Dynamo and the Butterfly
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: I half think Phil is managing Arsenal in the style of that Liverpool season he had on FM where he was making Torres rot
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: Ozil's reputation is possibly benefiting from not playing
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: In that he's become the answer
30/10/2019, 12:52 - David;: What's the logic behind not playing Torreira?
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Whereas if he was coming on as sub or starting cup games, he might just be putting in the same ineffectual perfomances as before
30/10/2019, 12:53 - David;: Good to have as an option though. Unlike anyone else in your squad. Can unlock a defence
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Most people don't understand it. All I've read is that Emery has always used a really tall and dominant defensive midfielder and Torreira was scouted before Emery came in, so he doesn't like him much
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Exat
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Exactly
30/10/2019, 12:54 - David;: Can't Guendouzi the galloping foal fulfil that role though - quite tall?
30/10/2019, 12:54 - David;: plus that hair is adding another few inches
30/10/2019, 13:06 - Rob;: Yes, and he has been our best player after Auba this year
30/10/2019, 13:06 - Rob;: So I would play him and Torreira
30/10/2019, 13:06 - Rob;: But Emery is a mad joke that has been sent to fuck shit up
30/10/2019, 13:18 - David;: Still can't speak English
30/10/2019, 13:25 - Damian Rumble: So trump is basically the captain of your team. Can't see that possibly going wrong...
30/10/2019, 13:32 - Rob;: But without the element of his use of shithouse techniques being in anyway effective
30/10/2019, 20:31 - Phill: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7629757/Woman-31-identified-CAT-teenage-years.html
30/10/2019, 20:49 - David;: Little game on Rob
30/10/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Is Emery just trolling ozil by playing him in this team
30/10/2019, 20:54 - David;: How worried about Herby Kane's impact?
30/10/2019, 20:57 - Rob;: Harry Typo
30/10/2019, 20:57 - Paul;: Herby Kane
30/10/2019, 21:23 - Damian Rumble: 5-5
30/10/2019, 21:23 - Damian Rumble: What is football
30/10/2019, 21:26 - David;: 5‚É£5‚É£
30/10/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
30/10/2019, 21:44 - David;: I'd 5-5 (5-4 on pens) be an Arsenal fan right now
30/10/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: Thanks for winning by neither, Unai
30/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: Lol - quite a good prediction though to be fair. He was 2 mins out
30/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Rob are you butt devastated you scored 5 at anfield and still didn‚Äôt win
30/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Has your butt experienced much worse frustration
30/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: Last time that happened to a team - must be talking decades
30/10/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Specifically Anfield or away?
30/10/2019, 21:46 - Paul;: Is your butt in fact hurting
30/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: Any team scoring 5 at anfield and not winning
30/10/2019, 21:46 - Rob;: As Reading scored 5 against us but lost to 7 goals exactly 7 years ago
30/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: A fairly rare occurance
30/10/2019, 21:46 - Rob;: Perhaps that has never happened yes
30/10/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: I am not overly butthurt - league cup, second teams and pens
30/10/2019, 21:47 - Paul;: If only you bought the banana shirt. None of this would have happened
30/10/2019, 21:47 - David;: Yeah was a great game. I would have been annoyed but understated to lose that
30/10/2019, 21:47 - David;: *undevestated
30/10/2019, 21:48 - Paul;: Good to get a little win though
30/10/2019, 21:49 - David;: Yeah yeah a great troll
30/10/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: I think losing the league cup final is the only point at which it feels as bad as losing a prem game really
30/10/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: Worse then, really
30/10/2019, 21:51 - Rob;: Martinelli 7 goals in 4 starts. Better than Messi and Ronaldo. Seems obvious now
30/10/2019, 21:53 - David;: But Dr pepe keeping him out of the team
30/10/2019, 21:53 - Rob;: Play on opposite wings
30/10/2019, 21:54 - Rob;: He's the Messi of the marginal cup fixtures
30/10/2019, 21:54 - David;: Good to have that messi
30/10/2019, 21:54 - David;: Not the actual one. I'd prefer that
30/10/2019, 21:54 - Rob;: /a flan
30/10/2019, 21:55 - David;: Would be good if Messi was awful I marginal cups. Couldn't buy a goal
30/10/2019, 21:55 - Rob;: I would love to see him go to an incredibly small club next, just to see if he could get them serial promotions
30/10/2019, 21:56 - Rob;: Off to Dulwich Hamlet
30/10/2019, 21:57 - David;: I always used to sign a washed up rivaldo on FM on a free for championship sides

30/10/2019, 22:13 - Damian Rumble: Old news. That was announced about 6 months ago
30/10/2019, 22:13 - Damian Rumble: Shame alot of the moderate Tories are going. Going to miss Kenneth
30/10/2019, 22:21 - Stefan;: Damo why are they parachuting Sam Gymiah into Kensington where the pro-remain Labour MP has a majority of 20 votes over the Tories?
30/10/2019, 22:22 - David;: Yeah cunts
30/10/2019, 22:23 - David;: You're the reason we're going to get a hard brexit, as long as you accept that
30/10/2019, 22:23 - David;: and therefore dont moan when it happens
30/10/2019, 22:27 - Phill: Because they're thick as pick shit. Read: libtard.
30/10/2019, 22:27 - Phill: Pig shit*
30/10/2019, 22:28 - Phill: Damo explain why if quantum mechanics was real, and physics wasn't a lie, we can't have leave and remain at the same time?
30/10/2019, 22:37 - Damian Rumble: Yeah that one is a mystery to me. They have done that for a number of our other converts and I have seen some polling that suggests we would win well in a few specific places. I suspect the labour vote in Kensington has collapsed and that the pro remain Tories will happily vote for one of thier own even if he is actually running for another party.
30/10/2019, 22:41 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure I can tbh. I think to explain that I would first need to be able to explain how you can  simultaneously be a pro leave daily mail loving gammon and life time labour supporter who voted remain...
30/10/2019, 22:43 - David;: Schrodinger's troll

31/10/2019, 08:42 - David;: It was between the wars of course
31/10/2019, 08:44 - David;: Ah we're actually too busy to play the quarter final Rob. Sorry about that. Something more important's come up.
31/10/2019, 08:48 - Rob;: Would the team you draw go into the semis, or would be get to play in your place if it can't be rearranged?
31/10/2019, 08:49 - Hamish Sinclair: I think the team we would play get a bye
31/10/2019, 09:08 - David;: Would make more sense for arsenal to play it surely?
31/10/2019, 09:08 - David;: Get the tie, tv revenues etc.
31/10/2019, 09:09 - Hamish Sinclair: But arsenal are no longer in the competition
31/10/2019, 09:09 - David;: But couldn't you read that as us forfeiting the match
31/10/2019, 09:10 - Hamish Sinclair: No we technically forfeit the next match.
31/10/2019, 09:10 - David;: I suppose
31/10/2019, 09:10 - Hamish Sinclair: We just played arsenal, we have a result for that game
31/10/2019, 09:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Next
31/10/2019, 09:19 - Rob;: Yeah I think it will be a bye for the next side
31/10/2019, 09:19 - Rob;: It would be problematic otherwise, say if we won and denied a team a European place
31/10/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: Phil are you looking forward to your socialist life under labour?
31/10/2019, 12:28 - David;: The 4 day week, more time to froust and play WoW
31/10/2019, 12:29 - Rob;: 4 day week would be amazing, I won't hear otherwise
31/10/2019, 12:30 - Paul;: Comrade Hastings
31/10/2019, 12:31 - Sam;: Yeah. The only debate should be which day to loose. Monday? Friday? The more controversial Wednesday to split the week up?
31/10/2019, 12:31 - David;: Got to Monday
31/10/2019, 12:31 - David;: So can really bed down into deep grot on saturday/sunday and still time to recover
31/10/2019, 12:32 - Sam;: Yeah. A reset day
31/10/2019, 12:32 - David;: Just to get back onto an even keel
31/10/2019, 12:32 - Sam;: Yeah, can‚Äôt tamper with the ‚Äòfriday feeling‚Äô
31/10/2019, 12:33 - David;: Then again, never facing more than a 2-day stint at a time would be appealing
31/10/2019, 12:33 - David;: The big Tuesday night
31/10/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: Agree, although wouldn't Thursday become the new Friday, in a more real sense than how people say it now
31/10/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: I'd vote to hill Monday though and everyone has to agree that day is just for chilling out. Don't be coming at me with plans
31/10/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: *kill
31/10/2019, 12:36 - David;: Would be good to be able to have a weekend away somewhere and then have a day to recover rather than straight into the week and not had time for the weekend reset
31/10/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Yeah, and rather than just increasing the weekend away to include of Monday so you feel just as tired
31/10/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Respect the extra day
31/10/2019, 12:38 - Damian Rumble: The problem is that you need some good sport on a proper rest day. Monday is limited
31/10/2019, 12:38 - Damian Rumble: Wednesday day off exclusively for champions League
31/10/2019, 12:38 - Rob;: Damo, it's not like media companies wouldn't respond
31/10/2019, 12:39 - Rob;: We don't have a weekend because fun things happen then, the fun things were scheduled to happen at the weekend
31/10/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Sorry, it's just endless repeats of homes under the hammer on the new third day if the weekend. Nothing we can do
31/10/2019, 12:40 - Sam;: Lol.
31/10/2019, 12:41 - Sam;: The weekend being created second. Hib
31/10/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: You know the fish and chip shop in chippy would remain closed, for sure
31/10/2019, 13:11 - Damian Rumble: Sorry guys. Bargain hunt have got a contract for Monday prime time slots up to 2026. No choice but to stick with that until
31/10/2019, 13:27 - David;: Lol. This got me
31/10/2019, 13:28 - David;: 'We can't work it out but all of the entertainment seems to always fall on these same two days, is there any way we can schedule public holidays to reflect this?'
31/10/2019, 13:31 - David;: 'Millions of people keep calling off sick, we're linking it to all of the great television and sport that is packed into Saturday and Sunday. But the formal days off are still falling on Monday and Tuesday can we just move this?'
31/10/2019, 13:43 - Rob;: A whole league system of football has developed, staffed and attended exclusively by people pulling sickies
31/10/2019, 13:43 - Rob;: It's ruining the economy
31/10/2019, 14:01 - Sam;: They don‚Äôt care if they loose their jobs! What do we do?!
31/10/2019, 14:01 - David;: Also the papers are producing bumper editions just on those weekdays.

02/11/2019, 08:36 - Jack G;: It does have basis in truth though. Look at the amount of respect the refs get from players. No drama
02/11/2019, 08:37 - Phill: Yeah football is a cunts sport.
02/11/2019, 08:37 - Phill: Love it, but it is for cunts.
02/11/2019, 08:38 - Phill: If Nigel Owens was a football ref he'd be abused relentlessly all match
02/11/2019, 08:39 - Rob;: Yeah, but there are other factors at play there. One goal is huge in football, a try isn't much in rugby, hence not as much incentive to bend rules. Rugby fans just don't need to be constantly projecting superiority because their sport is nicer to refs.
02/11/2019, 08:39 - Jack G;: >a try isn‚Äôt much in rugby
02/11/2019, 08:39 - Paul;: Not enough people care about the try
02/11/2019, 08:41 - Jack G;: South Africa have won their last 2 world cups without conceding or scoring a try in the final. Would have made a huge difference on either side
02/11/2019, 08:41 - Paul;: If anyone was watching
02/11/2019, 08:45 - Rob;: Only five matches in the whole world cup settled by a single try, they're worth less than goals in football
02/11/2019, 08:53 - David;: I prefer a flan
02/11/2019, 08:53 - Paul;: All agreed there‚Äôs no excuse for ever watching F1 at least
02/11/2019, 08:54 - David;: I'd only be interested I watching an interview with one of the engineers who built the car
02/11/2019, 08:54 - Jack G;: Yes, pointless
02/11/2019, 08:54 - Damian Rumble: > not watching your team compete in a world cup final because you think a try is worth too much
02/11/2019, 08:54 - David;: That determines who wins so the actual racing irrelevant
02/11/2019, 08:56 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
02/11/2019, 09:03 - Paul;: Anything on worth watching?
02/11/2019, 09:05 - David;: Robot wars at 10?
02/11/2019, 09:05 - Paul;: Now that was a programme
02/11/2019, 09:05 - Phill: Paul you go to live six Nations games
02/11/2019, 09:07 - Paul;: Never seen a live six nations game
02/11/2019, 09:07 - David;: Cricket, now that's a sport
02/11/2019, 09:07 - Phill: I went to watch a Wales game with you and Derek
02/11/2019, 09:08 - Paul;: Versus New Zealand
02/11/2019, 09:08 - Rob;: If England were in the robot wars final I would watch
02/11/2019, 09:08 - Phill: Runs not important.
02/11/2019, 09:09 - Damian Rumble: Sitting down for fives days and the result still being a draw. Now that's sport for you...
02/11/2019, 09:10 - Phill: >sitting down at the start of the F1 season knowing who's won already
02/11/2019, 09:10 - Paul;: >watching egg ball

02/11/2019, 09:38 - David;: Thankfully you're not missing anything because of it
02/11/2019, 09:38 - David;: Should be back up for the Bournemouth United game
02/11/2019, 09:39 - Rob;: One Christmas day at Rollright I'd just put the beef rib in to slow cook and got a call to say they would need to turn the power off until 3pm
02/11/2019, 09:39 - Damian Rumble: You should be able to stream the final one your phone I reckon
02/11/2019, 09:43 - Phill: >on my phone
02/11/2019, 09:43 - Phill: >not even 3g here
02/11/2019, 09:56 - Damian Rumble: First half over. No tries. Seems like the kind of game a single try might be decisive....
02/11/2019, 09:56 - David;: I imagine staring at a blank screen is more enjoyable than the match
02/11/2019, 10:52 - David;: Lol >England
02/11/2019, 10:53 - Jack G;: Thought you weren‚Äôt watching
02/11/2019, 10:53 - Damian Rumble: Fuck off
02/11/2019, 10:53 - Jack G;: üëç
02/11/2019, 10:54 - David;: Caught the second half. A shambles as expected.
02/11/2019, 10:55 - David;: What's the point of scrums and line  outs when they just throw it directly to their team.
02/11/2019, 10:56 - Phill: Like throw-ins?
02/11/2019, 10:57 - David;: You can contest a throw in.
02/11/2019, 10:57 - Phill: You can contest a line out
02/11/2019, 10:57 - David;: No, you stand vaguely alongside them as it is thrown directly to their player
02/11/2019, 10:58 - David;: Scrums. Go directly back toward your side. They never get turned over. Pointless.
02/11/2019, 10:58 - Phill: Contesting line outs and turning over scrums is how we beat new Zealand
02/11/2019, 10:58 - David;: Try and win the ball back you say? Penalty against you for that.
02/11/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: We're just leaving now
02/11/2019, 11:10 - Paul;: >
02/11/2019, 11:13 - David;: Thanks for letting us know we'll meet you there
02/11/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: Ah
02/11/2019, 11:34 - / James Ball: Just watched tomorrow's world from December 1979. A recap of the predictions from the 70s. One of the things that they were all surprised by was female presenters of the programme. No one could have guessed that happening. Flying cars - no problem.
02/11/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: Would you let my parents know?
02/11/2019, 11:37 - David;: What was the thing they got most wrong? Something they were very confident was just around the corner
02/11/2019, 11:38 - / James Ball: A lot of coverage of transport events. Concord, channel tunnel which, when built, would carry 50,000 passengers a day to France from the new "London Central" station.
02/11/2019, 11:39 - / James Ball: On mile long trains.
02/11/2019, 11:39 - / James Ball: Not totally wrong but different
02/11/2019, 11:40 - Paul;: Good to build a train so long it can‚Äôt actually move due to length so you just have to walk down it anyway to reach France
02/11/2019, 11:41 - Rob;: Yeah, a train simultaneously in London and Paris
02/11/2019, 11:41 - Paul;: In order to fit all those people they kept lengthening the train
02/11/2019, 11:42 - / James Ball: https://youtu.be/pYbRZmKsZsQ
02/11/2019, 11:43 - / James Ball: A lot of old fashioned numbers "a thousand million"
02/11/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: You could do that on the circle line and connect the front of the train with the back and just keep it moving around
02/11/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Incredibly slowly
02/11/2019, 11:44 - Rob;: So before the American billion got adopted?
02/11/2019, 11:44 - Stefan;: So basically a massive circular version of an airport travelator
02/11/2019, 11:44 - / James Ball: yeah, they use the old long billion a few times as well
02/11/2019, 11:45 - / James Ball: 20:30 is basically the first use of the internet
02/11/2019, 11:46 - Rob;: Yes, but it takes you to work and makes you depressed instead of taking you to a holiday
02/11/2019, 11:50 - David;: Always on time though
02/11/2019, 11:52 - David;: After the Apollo missions everyone was confident a permanent moon base was a sure thing

02/11/2019, 20:19 - Paul;: All pallets?
02/11/2019, 20:30 - David;: You appear to be standing next to the buncefield pil depot
02/11/2019, 20:41 - / James Ball: Yeh
02/11/2019, 20:43 - / James Ball: Much burning. Local forest firework display. Guy next to me lit up a phat blunt when the fireworks went off
03/11/2019, 08:33 - Paul;: Just realised how disgusting the Man U away kit is. That‚Äôs why you lose games. If you don‚Äôt have a strong kit it demotivates the team
03/11/2019, 10:29 - Sam;: I hate it. Worse than the pink one last season
03/11/2019, 10:53 - Paul;: Need to change that if you‚Äôre to win
03/11/2019, 10:54 - David;: Solskjaer out?
03/11/2019, 10:56 - Phill: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 11:02 - Sam;: Nah solkjaer in. We‚Äôre not arsenal fans.
03/11/2019, 11:05 - David;: True you've sacked 3 managers in the time they've sacked 1.
03/11/2019, 11:10 - Sam;: Woah woah woah. The board sack them, not the fans. I said we‚Äôre not like the arsenal fans.

03/11/2019, 19:27 - Paul;: You watching the F1?
03/11/2019, 20:01 - Sam;: His dark materials then
03/11/2019, 20:01 - Sam;: Starting now
03/11/2019, 20:01 - Paul;: Channel?
03/11/2019, 20:02 - David;: What?
03/11/2019, 20:02 - David;: Where?
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: I‚Äôm on it
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: Watching
03/11/2019, 20:03 - David;: You can't spring this on us out of the blue
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: Scope
03/11/2019, 20:03 - David;: Which channel?
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: Huge
03/11/2019, 20:05 - David;: Have they finally got it right not fucked it like the film
03/11/2019, 20:09 - Damian Rumble: What I time for my internet connection to go down...
03/11/2019, 20:11 - Sam;: BBC one
03/11/2019, 20:11 - Sam;: It‚Äôll iPlayer as well though
03/11/2019, 20:12 - Sam;: 8 part series
03/11/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: Yeah I‚Äôm banging it through iplayer
03/11/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: The weasel looks like my cat
03/11/2019, 20:15 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
03/11/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: Longform works so much better for books
03/11/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: Should be good

03/11/2019, 20:24 - Paul;: Damians daemon = goose
03/11/2019, 20:25 - Jack G;: Ah this could be big. Definitely will be watching
03/11/2019, 20:28 - Damian Rumble: Obviously
03/11/2019, 20:29 - Rob;: Dave = owl
03/11/2019, 20:47 - Paul;: Why‚Äôs that weasel changing colour?
03/11/2019, 20:50 - Rob;: Children's daemons can change form
03/11/2019, 20:51 - Paul;: Form?
03/11/2019, 20:51 - Paul;: A bit of colour?
03/11/2019, 20:55 - Paul;: 10/10 for dark mattys
03/11/2019, 20:58 - Rob;: In the book he takes lots of weasel like forms: pine marten, stoat etc. Basically the same thing
03/11/2019, 20:58 - Paul;: Ah right
03/11/2019, 20:58 - Paul;: Weasels about
03/11/2019, 21:00 - David;: What's the point?
03/11/2019, 21:00 - David;: May as well stay a weasel rather than morph into almost identical animals
03/11/2019, 21:14 - Sam;: He can do what he wants mate
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Paul;: With the goose you‚Äôd get the option of a duck?
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Paul;: But not a swan?
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Paul;: Can never upgrade?
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Rob;: They can literally be anything they want, but they tend to take forms that represent their child's character at most times
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Paul;: Well why not go lion all the time
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Rob;: Then settle on the thing that sort of represents them most
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Paul;: Poor daemon management
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Rob;: It's not really a choice
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Paul;: Thought you said can just become anything. Upgrade that weasel
03/11/2019, 21:17 - Paul;: Now get that weasel out of my sight
03/11/2019, 21:17 - Rob;: You'll probably see it become something better when required
03/11/2019, 21:17 - Rob;: I think if you really wanted it to settle as a lion you'd end up with something really shit
03/11/2019, 21:18 - Rob;: Ask for lion get wood louse
03/11/2019, 21:18 - Paul;: Jack asks for lion gets nematode
03/11/2019, 21:19 - Stefan;: This isn't like buying a pet or an attack dog
03/11/2019, 21:20 - Paul;: Very similar
03/11/2019, 21:21 - Damian Rumble: I remember in the book there are sailors for whom thier demons end up being fish so they can essentially never leave the sea
03/11/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: You'd think a stallion would be great until you buy a 3rd floor flat
03/11/2019, 21:23 - Paul;: A basking shark
03/11/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: A mole. Always needing to be near soil
03/11/2019, 21:32 - Damian Rumble: Sea anemone. Like what the hell would you do with that...
03/11/2019, 21:32 - Paul;: Lol
03/11/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Permanently stuck in shallow waters
03/11/2019, 21:35 - Rob;: Get a little tank for it
03/11/2019, 21:35 - Rob;: One of those gross stinking sloths would be shit
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Rob;: That's there on your wedding night
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Paul;: Lol a constant waft of shit
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Rob;: Someone in that world has had to take a flamingo to a funeral
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Paul;: Or an animal that goes into heat in a bad way
03/11/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: I don't think they'd copy a genuine animal's life cycle. They are just a facet of you
03/11/2019, 21:41 - Paul;: Do they know they‚Äôre a daemon or do they think humans are their things?
03/11/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: They know
03/11/2019, 22:05 - Sam;: Does he know?
04/11/2019, 11:52 - David;: https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10269880/lukaku-inter-scoring-record-ronaldo-serie-a/
04/11/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: Sambo, don‚Äôt you need a goal scorer?
04/11/2019, 11:55 - David;: Seem like they could really use a ronaldo- grade forward
04/11/2019, 12:15 - Sam;: Italian league is an easy league and he doesn‚Äôt fit the new style of football. He was never shit, hence his transfer fee to inter
04/11/2019, 12:19 - Jack G;: So United are shit?
04/11/2019, 12:20 - David;: Yeah I think that's the takeaway
04/11/2019, 12:20 - David;: Leves, instantly becomes world class
04/11/2019, 12:26 - David;: So Ronaldo is no good either? Can't be as currently playing in Italy. In fact does this mean Daniel James is better than Ronaldo?
04/11/2019, 12:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Famously difficult league to score in
04/11/2019, 12:27 - David;: "Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the most tactical national league.[2] Serie A was the world's second-strongest national league in 2014 according to IFFHS.[3] Serie A is ranked third among European leagues according to UEFA's league coefficient, behind La Liga and the Premier League, and ahead of the Bundesliga"
04/11/2019, 12:37 - Sam;: 2014 Dave. Great data üëçüèª
04/11/2019, 12:38 - Sam;: Straw man me all you want. Serie A is inferior to the premier league
04/11/2019, 15:05 - David;: Damian why haven't you investigated what's going on on Europa yet?
04/11/2019, 15:23 - Damian Rumble: Are you asking about the EU or the football league?
04/11/2019, 15:52 - David;: The jovian moon
04/11/2019, 16:17 - / James Ball: Which one?
04/11/2019, 16:18 - Rob;: Europa...
04/11/2019, 16:18 - Damian Rumble: Technically very difficult to land a probe on Europa. The moon orbits in the 'van Allen radiation belt' of Jupiter. Essentially ba region of space around the planet where damaging solar radiation particles get trapped. As a result anything electronic that spends more than hour or so on the surface will get fried. Flybe missions [of the moon] are the only one that are practical at the moment
04/11/2019, 16:20 - Damian Rumble: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt
04/11/2019, 16:46 - David;: pop up a little shield
04/11/2019, 16:48 - Rob;: Great autocorrect. I didn't realise British commercial airline Flybe were running missions to Jupiter's moons
04/11/2019, 16:49 - Jack G;: No wonder so many airlines are going bust
04/11/2019, 16:50 - David;: Given that they can't get me from Birmingham to Edinburgh sucessfully I doubt they are going to Europa on the regular
04/11/2019, 16:51 - Stefan;: Fly Be To The Moon(s of Jupiter)

04/11/2019, 17:43 - Damian Rumble: this guy... so much regrets
04/11/2019, 17:50 - Damian Rumble: Damo why are they parachuting Sam Gymiah into Kensington where the pro-remain Labour MP has a majority of 20 votes over the Tories?
04/11/2019, 17:51 - Damian Rumble: "We [https://www.bestforbritain.org/] have tried, wherever possible, to back the sitting MP with a strong voting record on Remain. One place we haven‚Äôt done this, Kensington, is because Labour is so far behind the Lib Dems that backing them could give the seat back to the Tories"

04/11/2019, 17:52 - Damian Rumble: In answer to your query @447752458076
04/11/2019, 17:55 - Damian Rumble: "There are London seats that the Conservatives won in 2017, and where the Labour party came second. But our polling shows clearly that in such places as the Cities of London and Westminster, Chelsea and Fulham, and Wimbledon, the Liberal Democrats are now the party best placed to unite an anti-Conservative vote with a clear Remain message. That analysis may be inconvenient to Labour but it is the product of cold, hard, recent data. "
04/11/2019, 18:20 - Jack G;: Gutted Bercow is going
04/11/2019, 18:21 - Hamish Sinclair: The polls so often predict so well
04/11/2019, 18:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Far back by what metric?
04/11/2019, 18:23 - Damian Rumble: I remember that time we all thought Hillary was going to become a president
04/11/2019, 18:24 - Hamish Sinclair: That is my point
04/11/2019, 18:25 - Damian Rumble: "Polls exist for the purpose of influencing public opinion, not informing it"
04/11/2019, 18:28 - David;: They have not understood encumbancy effects, campaign effects, membership numbers, how FPTP works basically
04/11/2019, 18:29 - David;: To say lib Dems have better chance of winning a seat labour lost by 20 than labour based on recent polling is mental
04/11/2019, 19:02 - / James Ball: Oldest known British joke found in a book of Anglo Saxon poetry from the 10th century:

What hangs at a man's thigh and wants to poke the hole that it's oft poked before?

A key.
04/11/2019, 19:04 - Paul;: Lol that joke
04/11/2019, 19:07 - / James Ball: The oldest known joke in the world is Sumerian and dates to 1900BC

Something which has never occurred since time immemorial; a young woman did not fart in her husband's lap
04/11/2019, 19:10 - Rob;: He tells it like it was
04/11/2019, 20:09 - David;: Knobs and shit, the core themes haven't changed
04/11/2019, 20:10 - Paul;: This lacks a stunning punch line like the Anglo Saxon one
04/11/2019, 20:12 - David;: The Sumerians had a real turn

She had long been enduring acute pain, and the midwife, candle in hand, inspected her secret area, in order to ascertain if the child was coming. ‚ÄúLook also on the other side,‚Äù said the poor creature, ‚Äúmy husband has sometimes taken that road.‚Äù

04/11/2019, 20:46 - David;: Instructions: Heat sheep fat in a pot wide enough for the diced lamb to spread in one layer. Add lamb and sear on high heat until all moisture evaporates. Fold in the onion and keep cooking until it is almost transparent. Fold in salt, beetroot, rocket, fresh coriander, Persian shallot and cumin. Keep on folding until the moisture evaporates. Pour in beer, and then add water. Give the mixture a light stir and then bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add leek and garlic. Allow to simmer for about an hour until the sauce thickens.

Pound kurrat and remaining fresh coriander into a paste using a mortar and pestle. Ladle the stew into bowls and sprinkle with coriander seeds and kurrat and fresh coriander paste. The dish can be served with steamed bulgur, boiled chickpeas and bread.

The bones burn very well, and the paunch easily contains all the meat once it has been stripped off. In this way an ox, or any other sacrificial beast, is ingeniously made to boil itself."

13/11/2019, 16:08 - Damian Rumble: ... I think HQ are working on the basis that most of our votes to be won are from labour whilst ignoring the unfortunate side effect of that is the Tories wining power

13/11/2019, 16:26 - Damian Rumble: There is no chance. Partially I don't think we want to open the door to a mass stand down like the brexit party did as that means less votes overall which means less press coverage and money for the next 5 years

13/11/2019, 16:42 - Jack G;: This whole situation could be avoided if we had a proper voting system
13/11/2019, 16:43 - Stefan;: Where did you hear this?
13/11/2019, 16:43 - Rob;: Imagine if people had cared as much about the AV referendum as the Brexit one
13/11/2019, 16:46 - Rob;: 'I'd rather be dead in a ditch than not have AV, but if no one votes for that my second vote is to be fine and in a pub'
13/11/2019, 16:47 - Jack G;: Local labour campaigner so could be fake news
13/11/2019, 16:56 - Damian Rumble: Which makes it all the more annoying that they won't budge. If labour withdrew 10 of our tory marginals and we from 10 of there's that would be Rob 20 seats from the Tories and any chance of them getting a majority
13/11/2019, 16:56 - Damian Rumble: *would rob them of 20 seats
13/11/2019, 16:57 - Damian Rumble: >Rob
13/11/2019, 16:57 - David;: Agree
13/11/2019, 16:57 - David;: But still reacting to that not happening in this way only has the practical effect of delivering a Tory majority
13/11/2019, 16:58 - Jack G;: Thing is though that gives the tories an easy attack line of ‚ÄúLib Dems working with Corbyn‚Äù and con/lib swingers would run back to tories
13/11/2019, 16:59 - David;: Lol con/lib swingers
13/11/2019, 17:00 - Damian Rumble: This is a concern forsure
13/11/2019, 17:01 - David;: Yes it's true that there are lib Dem voters who would switch to cons rather than labour if a lib Dem stood down. Would need to decompose the lib vote to understand fully, which there is no data on at constituency level
13/11/2019, 17:05 - Damian Rumble: Personally I think such decisions should be taken at a local level based on local feelings for a local candidate and not reflect the national leadership (which is millstone round the labour parties neck)
13/11/2019, 17:16 - Paul;: Are there any labour supporters left in the north?
13/11/2019, 17:19 - David;: You can still find them
13/11/2019, 17:19 - David;: A handful
13/11/2019, 17:20 - Stefan;: YouGov found that of voters currently intending to vote LibDem, many more voted Labour in 2017 than Con
13/11/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: Let's just do away with all parties and MPs and instead hold a referendum on every single issue. Stop denying the will of the people
13/11/2019, 17:23 - Jack G;: Or the all powerful damo bot
13/11/2019, 17:23 - David;: So become Switzerland
13/11/2019, 17:24 - Rob;: Have a 4pm referendum every day. NHS yes. War no. Back in time for tea
13/11/2019, 17:25 - Paul;: The rumbletron. Just make it happen. I think it‚Äôs inevitable
13/11/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: I like that of all the humans we chose Damo
13/11/2019, 17:26 - Paul;: Choose the dictator
13/11/2019, 17:27 - David;: What if the rumbletrons algorithms choose a policy of abolishing itself?
13/11/2019, 17:27 - Rob;: I don't think Damo would ever give up power would he?
13/11/2019, 17:28 - Jack G;: It would just turn itself off and on again, pretend it never happened
13/11/2019, 17:28 - Paul;: No of course not
13/11/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: Would you, Damo?
13/11/2019, 17:29 - Paul;: The Lib Dem facade is a ruse
13/11/2019, 17:29 - Rob;: Or is their facade a ruse?
13/11/2019, 17:30 - Paul;: He‚Äôs slowly gathering data on us so he can start controlling the thread before uk wide roll out
13/11/2019, 17:30 - David;: A very shit ineffective ruse
13/11/2019, 17:31 - David;: Full voting rights for geese I assume
13/11/2019, 17:32 - Jack G;: Is voting required with the rumbletron in power?
13/11/2019, 17:32 - Paul;: No it makes decisions for you
13/11/2019, 17:33 - Paul;: It‚Äôs programmed by Damian
13/11/2019, 17:33 - Paul;: People are too stupid and don‚Äôt deserve to vote he argues, so instead he is left in charge of programming an algorithm that makes choices and that‚Äôs your vote
13/11/2019, 17:34 - Damian Rumble: I just willing and peacefully gave up control of my frisbee team... Does that count
13/11/2019, 17:35 - Damian Rumble: It's like the Chinese system. You can vote so we can call it a democracy but you can only vote for rumbletron
13/11/2019, 17:35 - David;: But the politburo of geese really pull the strings
13/11/2019, 18:06 - Paul;: Would rumbletron pick from the entire population of who best to ‚Äúrun‚Äù the country
13/11/2019, 18:06 - Paul;: From harvesting personality data
13/11/2019, 18:07 - Jack G;: Why have anyone? Just the supercomputer telling us what to do
13/11/2019, 18:07 - Jack G;: Skynet style
13/11/2019, 18:07 - Paul;: How do we communicate with rumbletron?
13/11/2019, 18:08 - David;: All you can do is pollute your data trail
13/11/2019, 18:08 - David;: In patterns which may point the algorithm I different directions
13/11/2019, 18:11 - Jack G;: Develop a rival supercomputer that outputs constructed data patterns to influence rumbletrons decisions
13/11/2019, 18:30 - Damian Rumble: Jeremy Corbyn, "no indyref2 in Labour's first term"... You have to wonder if this guys can hear himself speak some times...

18/11/2019, 19:17 - David;: He'll probs pull out lots of Beatles classics etc. but still
18/11/2019, 19:18 - David;: Only so many times you can hear the hey Jude outro extended to 10 minutes
18/11/2019, 19:19 - Stefan;: The Hey Jude cycle will go on forever until he dies or the festival closes (whichever is earlier)
18/11/2019, 19:20 - David;: Lol he does like to flog that particular horse
18/11/2019, 19:21 - David;: I don't know how it's attained the status of a huge classic - not even in top 10 Beatles tracks for me
18/11/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Is not the point of this article that You were "on point with your policies" 10 years ago, yet alienated a generation by going back on your biggest pledge. Digging up something from 10 years ago very relevant when the effects still felt today (wasnt jo swinson in the coalition government?)

18/11/2019, 21:24 - David;: Also their little tantrum over the debate. Like a child demanding to stay up past bed time when the adults have started talking.
18/11/2019, 21:27 - Paul;: >@447854020575
18/11/2019, 22:17 - Damian Rumble: I will happily put ¬£100 on the lib Dems taking more seats off of the Tories (net) than Labour do.
19/11/2019, 01:18 - David;: Ammend this to include a) all of the additional seats they cause labour to lose that they would otherwise have held and b) the vulnerable Tory seats that are held by them due to splitting the anti-Tory vote - then yes I would take that. Otherwise it misses the point.
19/11/2019, 09:44 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
19/11/2019, 09:47 - Rob;: And that's Stefan throwing that United shade
19/11/2019, 09:47 - Stefan;: Lol
19/11/2019, 09:47 - Stefan;: Just got it from a friend
19/11/2019, 09:48 - Hamish Sinclair: I had to google the black eyed pea reference, imagine stefan had to do the same with the utd one?
19/11/2019, 09:52 - Stefan;: The Ferguson story was so much in the news that even I got it
19/11/2019, 09:54 - Rob;: Yeah a quarter of a century at the top gets you into popular culture
19/11/2019, 11:07 - David;: Lol. Et tu Stefan
19/11/2019, 14:32 - Damian Rumble: So I was curious to exactly how much of an effect this would be and to cut a long story short I got her ls of the data from 2017 and determined that in a) there are 7 seats at risk and b) there are 11 seats
19/11/2019, 14:34 - David;: Based on which assumptions?
19/11/2019, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: Of those I know we think we can win (or are at least trying hard to win) Southport, Kensington, Wimbledon, Westminster, Finchley/Folders green. There is also Canterbury which I believe we will field a paper candidate.

That leaves Portsmouth south, Bedford, Warwick and Warrington as your a) and Colchester, Truro, Putney, Watford, chipping Barnett, Camborne and reading west as your b)
19/11/2019, 14:43 - Damian Rumble: Firstly I look for constituencies where the total lib Dem vote is greater than the difference between labour and Tory vote. I dismiss any constituency where Lab or Con are not trying to win (vote percentage <25%) and any constituency where we are completely uncompetitive as we wouldn't ever bother campaigning (<5%)
19/11/2019, 14:43 - Damian Rumble: Finally I look at constituencies where the difference between lab/con is less than 15pts
19/11/2019, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: So total 11 constituencies where the lib Dems could potentially split the vote pointlessly leading to the Tories staying on. Not many
19/11/2019, 14:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Tories had a 10 seat majority last time round
19/11/2019, 14:45 - Rob;: But enough to more than replace the loss of the DUP as supply partners
19/11/2019, 14:46 - Damian Rumble: In this assumption I assumed we would win our high target seats off of the Tories so that 11 is not a net gain
19/11/2019, 14:48 - Hamish Sinclair: But the more people see of swinson the less they like her
19/11/2019, 15:09 - David;: I don't think this works. 2017 was a historic low lib Dem vote. So basing it on 2017 data doesn't map the phenomena under examination which is the effect of an increase in the lib dem vote. You'd have adjust that by e.g. applying a nation-wide swing based on current polling. Also cons could well be targeting constituencies with c.20% vote share last time around, under first past the post, precisely because they anticipate lib Dem remainers making them competitive I unlikely places.
19/11/2019, 15:09 - David;: And turnout dynamics
19/11/2019, 15:19 - Damian Rumble: Agreed. I am looking for somewhere I can get an up to date constituency by constituency dataset and revise this. Quite a lot of individual constituency pools show a big swing from labour to the lib Dems in some of our target seats but I'm not sure across the country
19/11/2019, 15:29 - David;: Yeah that's the problem with this election it's very constituency-specific which is hard to get good data on, hence all these MRPs. But they are also flawed based on which variables are included/excluded and given that the relationships between parameters are based on historical data so can change/break down
19/11/2019, 15:29 - David;: So no one knows essentially
19/11/2019, 15:31 - Jack G;: Who‚Äôs Raoul Moat

19/11/2019, 19:14 - Damian Rumble: So I dug up some MRP data from early November 2019. Under the same conditions this shows 156 seats at risk. 18% are predicted as a Tory hold (b) and 36% are predicted as a labour loss (a). (This does not include Scotland)

That being said this is just a model and I feel it is spreading support out rather widely where as the reality is a lot more constituency specific as you say.
19/11/2019, 19:23 - Phill: What makes you think labour and Tory are not fighting for every seat? What makes you think this is a normal election? What makes you think this a party election and not a Brexit election?
19/11/2019, 19:25 - Phill: What makes you think you can apply any sort of informed statistical analysis to an election that is unique within its context?
19/11/2019, 19:50 - Damian Rumble: Pochettino ded

19/11/2019, 20:39 - Paul;: They‚Äôll write him off straight away?
19/11/2019, 20:40 - Rob;: Hard to see another outcome
19/11/2019, 20:41 - Paul;: Because of the phrase Kane is not able?
19/11/2019, 20:42 - Paul;: They‚Äôre unlikely to have heard of him before so will base it off that
19/11/2019, 20:43 - Rob;: Yeah. They'll just see him as a Poch loyalist promoted above his station under the old regime, I'd imagine

19/11/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: During the debate the Tory press office Twitter account rebranded itself as 'FactcheckUK' then just said everything Corbyn said was a lie and that Boris was telling the truth. Seems like quite a childish strategy

20/11/2019, 07:46 - Jack G;: I wonder how Levy persuaded Mourinho to join consider how tight he is with spending.
20/11/2019, 08:03 - Paul;: Why would it kill spurs? Too frail and weak for it? Likely to make son cry?
20/11/2019, 08:06 - Jack G;: Just seen their next game is at our place, spicey
20/11/2019, 08:07 - Damian Rumble: But I thought that everyone knew mourinho was shit now ..
20/11/2019, 08:09 - Rob;: I am guessing she means he will kill the ideals she sees Spurs as having - playing nice football and not being managed by a human shaped cunt
20/11/2019, 08:09 - Rob;: Basically the same problem every club except Chelsea has had with Mourinho
20/11/2019, 08:09 - Paul;: He got Man U to 2nd. His greatest achievement. He‚Äôs excellent but people are too afraid of him
20/11/2019, 08:10 - Rob;: Mourinho would try to take the ring
20/11/2019, 08:10 - Rob;: Not someone you want in the fellowship
20/11/2019, 08:12 - Jack G;: His underdog seige mentality style suits spurs well though
20/11/2019, 08:12 - David;: Ah this is great
20/11/2019, 08:12 - David;: Can't wait to watch it all unravel
20/11/2019, 08:13 - Jack G;: Would love it if we can beat them on Saturday, not confident though
20/11/2019, 08:13 - Jack G;: Mourinho instantly on the back foot
20/11/2019, 08:15 - Rob;: The bounce though Jack
20/11/2019, 08:17 - Jack G;: Yeah that‚Äôs a concern. If there‚Äôs ever a game for us to turn our form around though it‚Äôs this

20/11/2019, 08:53 - Paul;: Pot to Arsenal. What then
20/11/2019, 08:57 - Paul;: Mourinho‚Äôs reputation definitely declined while at Man Utd. However, Utd‚Äôs plight since he left has shown how good a job he really did there. Genuinely still believe he‚Äòs one of the best managers in the world and this could be an great bit of business by Spurs.
20/11/2019, 09:04 - Sam;: clearly your opinion there lol..

20/11/2019, 09:50 - Paul;: Last season, Spurs didn't spend and Poch got them a Top 4 in the PL and the CL Final. He's had a rough start to the season, but on what planet do you bin a boss who can do that?! Mourinho is yesterday's man in football who only wins if he spends money. Spurs don't.
20/11/2019, 09:51 - Jack G;: Spot on. Poch has done miracles at spurs, had turn overachieving for 4 seasons straight and got them to a bloody champions league final

21/11/2019, 11:20 - / James Ball: Stanley knife and willpower
21/11/2019, 13:04 - David;: Is it a big problem people mistaking their pancreas for their penis?
21/11/2019, 13:05 - David;: Wasn't aware this was the battle we faced
21/11/2019, 13:35 - Paul;: Alex salmond ded

21/11/2019, 13:56 - Rob;: I think there's probably some context that would shed a different light on Salmond's thigh touching to yours, Paul
21/11/2019, 13:56 - Rob;: At least I hope so
21/11/2019, 14:06 - Paul;: Like a very vigorous touch

21/11/2019, 18:51 - Paul;: Jack who you voting for?
21/11/2019, 18:52 - Jack G;: Reluctantly labour. Ideal scenario they get enough seats for a well hung parliament but Corbyn has to resign
21/11/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Well hung.
21/11/2019, 18:53 - Jack G;: But expecting massive conservative majority tbh

21/11/2019, 21:19 - David;: Was going on about how it was the new town heritage area. Pretty sure democracy extends to streets with Georgian architecture? Last time I checked
21/11/2019, 21:20 - Stefan;: Just throw some venerable-sounding laws at him, even though they have nothing to do with your right to put up posters

22/11/2019, 08:29 - Jack G;: But what about your banana milkshake, you‚Äôd banoffee pie, your banana bread
22/11/2019, 08:30 - Paul;: No one eats them. It‚Äôs a front for the banana board
22/11/2019, 08:30 - Rob;: I could make do without those things
22/11/2019, 08:30 - Paul;: Jack how often are you smashing through a banana milkshake and banoffee pie?
22/11/2019, 08:31 - Rob;: The plantain though, the savoury non-manky banana. Can get on board with that
22/11/2019, 08:33 - Jack G;: A couple of times a year maybe. Strong options to have though, I‚Äôm on board with banana
22/11/2019, 08:34 - Paul;: But you‚Äôd rather keep the strawberry?
22/11/2019, 08:34 - Paul;: If one had to go

22/11/2019, 08:34 - Jack G;: Obvious choice
22/11/2019, 08:34 - Paul;: Exactly. Bananas out. Get rid. Done
22/11/2019, 08:34 - Paul;: You‚Äôll make do with strawberries
22/11/2019, 08:35 - Paul;: And be thankful
22/11/2019, 08:35 - Rob;: Strawberry probably a much less important fruit economically and in terms of feeding people worldwide, but yeah. Fuck that banana

22/11/2019, 09:19 - Paul;: It‚Äôs a guarantee
22/11/2019, 09:20 - Paul;: For some reason they love faux Japanese styling designed in Cheltenham
22/11/2019, 09:21 - Rob;: It's just so brash and weird. It doesn't fit at a with the otherwise thoroughly normal and tired look of the wearer
22/11/2019, 09:22 - / James Ball: But they're expensive so they must be good. I've met the superdry owner in Cheltenham. He's a bit of a toff

23/11/2019, 11:23 - David;: Would rather wreck his own career than validate the poch sacking
23/11/2019, 11:24 - David;: Quite a change of dressing room culture. Straight to shouty autist
23/11/2019, 11:24 - David;: From mild mannered boy who lived
23/11/2019, 11:33 - Jack G;: Will either be a Mourinho troll or he gets sent to the stands. No middle ground

23/11/2019, 13:07 - David;: Do I need a Son?
23/11/2019, 13:08 - David;: He's potentially a little mourinho terrier. Will turn his bullshit into motivation somehow
23/11/2019, 13:08 - Paul;: West Ham have statistically the worst keeper
23/11/2019, 13:08 - Paul;: Raw shit
23/11/2019, 13:08 - David;: I enjoyed the time Claudio bravo was letting I every single shot on target he faced

23/11/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: Injury to the hip
23/11/2019, 13:13 - David;: Ah so this would suddenly put Spurs 6th. Everything fine

23/11/2019, 16:34 - Paul;: Rob, you‚Äôve got to blame yourself
23/11/2019, 16:34 - David;: So arsenal 11-1 worse than Leicester on aggregate
23/11/2019, 16:35 - David;: That's how we've got to interpret this
23/11/2019, 16:35 - Jack G;: Their 2-0 loss to Leicester a few weeks back obviously the worse indicator
23/11/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Well we lost 2-0 to Leicester, so perhaps 13-1 worse
23/11/2019, 16:35 - Phill: Lol arsenal
23/11/2019, 16:36 - Jack G;: If the board don‚Äôt sack Emery after this they‚Äôre mental

23/11/2019, 16:40 - David;: How the VAR in-stadium experience working for you?
23/11/2019, 16:40 - Hamish Sinclair: We celebrated the retaking of the pen, which in hindsight was a mistake
23/11/2019, 16:40 - Sam;: Must have just had a mad 5 minutes
23/11/2019, 16:40 - Sam;: 2 pens
23/11/2019, 16:41 - Sam;: Ah, sky sports trolled and said it was 3 nil
23/11/2019, 16:41 - Rob;: VAR stole my Maddison goal
23/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: VAR gave me my vardy goal
23/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Captained
23/11/2019, 16:42 - Rob;: And took away the missed pen minus points
23/11/2019, 16:42 - Rob;: Big swing there

23/11/2019, 16:48 - Paul;: Rob will you get poch?
23/11/2019, 16:49 - Rob;: Who knows. He might not want the job, and I'm sure somehow Emery will remain for months and months
23/11/2019, 16:49 - Paul;: Are you a fan of the gunnersaurus?
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Oh huge
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Paul;: Would you take wenger back now?
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Excellent naff cultural icon
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: No
23/11/2019, 16:51 - Paul;: If it was either he came back or went to Tottenham?
23/11/2019, 16:51 - Paul;: And Henry joins him as the kit man
23/11/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Only as kit man?
23/11/2019, 16:52 - Paul;: He‚Äôd do other talisman functions
23/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: You couldn't let Henry just be a kit man, he's got a daughter to put through ancient history lessons at Highgate school
23/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: (my mate teaches her)
23/11/2019, 16:54 - Paul;: Well I‚Äôm afraid this is the scenario
23/11/2019, 16:55 - Paul;: Primarily kit man but available for talisman things but he has to be with wenger
23/11/2019, 16:55 - Rob;: Well yeah, in your unlikely scenario I'd rather have them both back than both at Spurs
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: But you have him for 10 years
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: That‚Äôs another thing I forgot to mention
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: So he's 80 before he finally retires? Christ
23/11/2019, 16:56 - David;: Emery in
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: Little goal then
23/11/2019, 16:57 - Jack G;: Still should go
23/11/2019, 16:57 - Jack G;: Southampton should have been 3 or 4 up

24/11/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: Did people find out who that guy was who didn‚Äôt believe he was in the top 50% of earners despite earning 80k?
24/11/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Someone did find his name I think, yeah
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Rob;: Not sure he needs to be personally embarrassed any more than he's already done himself
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Paul;: He was so angry earning 80k
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Rob;: Yeah
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Paul;: Couldn‚Äôt believe his misfortune
24/11/2019, 15:33 - Rob;: I think basically mixing up income with wealth
24/11/2019, 15:33 - Paul;: Was his point he tried to make that the richest people have no income so won‚Äôt be effected by it and need a different way to tax the super rich  or something
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: Just managed to confuse it all
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Rob;: No, not at all
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: I‚Äôm sure he said something to that effect
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Rob;: He thought a lot of people, doctors and solicitors namely, earned more than him
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: Or was about to
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Paul;: So is he not surprised by what he can afford?
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: He felt half of people earned more than him
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: It never got into that
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Paul;: Thinks of himself as poor. Classic northern mentality
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Stefan;: He just had a completely warped and self-pitying view of what others earn
24/11/2019, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: This would ha e actually been a good point
24/11/2019, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: But no I think he just thought 80k wasnt a lot and that all lawyers and doctors earn shit loads
24/11/2019, 15:36 - Rob;: He basically seemed to identify as low-income and not one of the fortunate, despite earning enough to be in the top 5%
24/11/2019, 15:38 - Paul;: So assumed lawyers are on at least 160k?
24/11/2019, 15:38 - Stefan;: Yeah, which is why income from wealth needs to be taxed the same as earned income
24/11/2019, 15:38 - Rob;: I think he probably hadn't thought of it in terms of percentiles, and couldn't deal with the idea that 80k+ is top 5% because it's nowhere near ¬£1 million
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Paul;: I wonder who‚Äôs paying him 80k. He seems quite clueless
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Hamish Sinclair: I had this thought aswell
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Think he works in IT
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Stefan;: This is it - the top 5% contains a huge range of incomes - top 1% and 0.1% are each massively different
24/11/2019, 15:40 - Paul;: https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/uk-news/bbc-question-time-debate-salary-17304576
24/11/2019, 15:42 - Paul;: Not even a real job
24/11/2019, 15:43 - Paul;: Very finchy

24/11/2019, 16:13 - David;: üëç
24/11/2019, 16:13 - Rob;: Lol, Bullet
24/11/2019, 16:16 - David;: Also don't even think he is one of the people labour will tax more? Thought they wanted a 50% rate above 100k
24/11/2019, 16:16 - David;: Plus changes to capital gains and corporation tax
24/11/2019, 16:17 - David;: Don't think he would pay any more income tax
24/11/2019, 16:25 - Sam;: On the labour calculator it‚Äôs about 80k at which you‚Äôd pay more under Corbin than the current, but it‚Äôs like a ¬£100 more. Irrelevant
24/11/2019, 16:26 - Sam;: https://calculate.forlabour.com
24/11/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: He's probably one of those people that thinks higher tax bands apply to your whole salary. The amount of people you meet who think that
24/11/2019, 16:30 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah, classic misconception
24/11/2019, 16:30 - David;: Ah yeah it will be this idiocy
24/11/2019, 16:33 - Rob;: They often then say something like 'I'd ask to earn ¬£1 under the threshold, then I'd earn 20% more'
24/11/2019, 16:34 - Paul;: Like arshavin
24/11/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: A conservative party worker actually wrote something to this affect on twitter, then had to delete her account in shame
24/11/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: Effect*
24/11/2019, 16:34 - David;: Another thing people famously misunderstand is that if you get something funded through taxation you have less of a drain on the income. E.g. he would have free  broadband so ¬£30 less every month he is not finding from disposable income. Just shifts how it is paid for.
24/11/2019, 16:34 - David;: *funding
24/11/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Yeah. Poor little meerkat. Hadn't factored in the difference in corruption here
24/11/2019, 16:35 - David;: If we had no NHS you would need health insurance so would have a bit more income but would just spend it on thay. People seem to have real trouble grasping this
24/11/2019, 16:39 - Paul;: There was a guy on the train who was speaking very loudly (assume on purpose) about how he was on Corbyns ‚Äòlist‚Äô and he was ready to move to Portugal to live tax free for 10 years. Buy to let person. Always full of shit usually anyway
24/11/2019, 16:40 - Paul;: Came across a complete cunt
24/11/2019, 16:41 - David;: There's a lot about
24/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Hate the buy to let people
24/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Your Jessica chai‚Äôs
24/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Always self promoting
24/11/2019, 16:43 - David;: Think Portugal charges tax last time I checked
24/11/2019, 16:44 - Paul;: Lol
24/11/2019, 16:44 - Paul;: 10 years free mate
24/11/2019, 16:44 - Paul;: Just go live there
24/11/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: That great show I found where the woman actually spent all her money going to financial freedom / get rich conferences and went bankrupt
24/11/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: From the expense of it
24/11/2019, 16:49 - Hamish Sinclair: This sounds great what was it called?
24/11/2019, 16:49 - David;: Nice irony there
24/11/2019, 16:49 - Hamish Sinclair: My favourite type of person is the one who owns multiple buy to let properties yet still cant understand how it's so dificult for their own kids to get on the property ladder
24/11/2019, 16:51 - Paul;: Trying to find the episode
24/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: I like all those painful 'We're 27 and we've managed to buy a house' articles, where they say they always buy the cheaper brand of biscuits etc for most of it, then casually slip in that they've been living with parents for five years, or received a large gift towards a deposit, without twigging that that is how, essentially that alone.
24/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: Rosie Newman was in one

24/11/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: Ah yeah the fucking avocado. ¬£1 for two servings.
24/11/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Meals not being an avoidable expensive
24/11/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Rent: probably worthy 300-700 avocados a month
24/11/2019, 16:58 - David;: Lol
24/11/2019, 17:00 - David;: Housing affordability mainly an issue of indulgent biscuit selection
24/11/2019, 17:01 - Paul;: What was she saying
24/11/2019, 17:01 - David;: Nothing to do with 30 years of financialisation
24/11/2019, 17:03 - Stefan;: Fiat 500 is the defining symbol of people like Rosie Newman
24/11/2019, 17:03 - Stefan;: Morons who think the economy is purely about individual effort and who don't understand marginal tax rates
24/11/2019, 17:03 - Rob;: I've been trying to find it but can't. We definitely shared it on the thread. I think basically the usual guff: we're careful, but also I lived rent free with parents for ages
24/11/2019, 17:05 - Paul;: So Midlands
24/11/2019, 17:05 - Paul;: Very super dry wearing

24/11/2019, 17:07 - Hamish Sinclair: I didnt know either and came up with this
24/11/2019, 17:08 - Stefan;: It's become shorthand for  un-self-aware young people who are outraged by higher taxes on over ¬£80K
24/11/2019, 17:08 - Paul;: >using Twitter

24/11/2019, 17:16 - Stefan;: Definitely Rosie Newman
24/11/2019, 17:16 - Rob;: I like how the love of Tango Ice Blast  that article talks about seemed like a randomly plucked specific to illustrate something general, but then crops up again and again in genuine tweets
24/11/2019, 17:16 - Rob;: I'd never even heard of Tango Ice Blast
24/11/2019, 17:17 - Rob;: Would Jodie Marie Brain be too stupid, rural and unfashionable to really be Fiat 500?
24/11/2019, 17:17 - David;: Is it just people who whole existence is geared towards the purchase of cheap tat essentially?
24/11/2019, 17:18 - David;: Bott wouldn't have the purchasing power to be fiat500
24/11/2019, 17:18 - Paul;: I think it‚Äôs a middle manager , super dry , midlands mentality
24/11/2019, 17:19 - Paul;: Likes F1
24/11/2019, 17:19 - Paul;: And lads holidays

24/11/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: Yeah, she's like Fiat500 grown up
24/11/2019, 17:20 - Paul;: People who wear super dry is your best example. People who like to think they‚Äôre salt of the earth or righteous but just aren‚Äôt quite
24/11/2019, 17:21 - Paul;: Will holiday in Dubai or go to Essex for a night out
24/11/2019, 17:21 - David;: Lol yeah yeah
24/11/2019, 17:21 - David;: Huge demographic. More of those than actual working class
24/11/2019, 17:22 - Phill: >holidaying in Dubai
24/11/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: Basically huge life focus on materialistic things. Really into affordable luxury. Not into anything mentally taxing, provocative, or odd. Happy to be in the mainstream and sees things outside that as weird, which is bad.
24/11/2019, 17:23 - David;: Schedule their lives around TV series - love island, I'm a celebrity etc.
24/11/2019, 17:23 - Paul;: Yeah yeah. Will often go to the cinema as a big weekend activity. Likely to have a membership to cineworld

24/11/2019, 17:29 - Rob;: I don't know how I'd begin to draw all these abstract things
24/11/2019, 17:29 - Paul;: The inbetweeners are a classic example. Those types of people
24/11/2019, 17:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah yeah. Probably still buys DVD and blurays
24/11/2019, 17:30 - David;: Will always be ordering whatever on the menu symbolises expense over what they actually want to eat. Oysters whenever offered

24/11/2019, 18:24 - David;: Hell of a 10 minutes though
24/11/2019, 18:24 - David;: At least the emergence of Williams. You can take that
24/11/2019, 18:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah you called it
24/11/2019, 18:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Who is William's?
24/11/2019, 18:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Not even on fantasy football
24/11/2019, 18:28 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/11/2019, 18:33 - Rob;: Very nice
24/11/2019, 18:33 - Rob;: Too much cold weather shit in Seven worlds, one planet
24/11/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: 'We're in Asia, where it's cold'
24/11/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: 'Welcome to freezing South America'
24/11/2019, 18:35 - David;: One of the best live sets ive ever seen. See them if you get the chance
24/11/2019, 18:35 - David;: Buy Blanco bonds
24/11/2019, 18:35 - Rob;: 'deep in the freezing oceans of... southern Australia'
24/11/2019, 18:36 - David;: 'one planet, all of it fucking freezing'
24/11/2019, 18:37 - David;: 'seven world all with a distinctive nip in the air'
24/11/2019, 18:37 - David;: *worlds
24/11/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Nothing but cold, white desert landscapes
24/11/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Billed as entirely different worlds
24/11/2019, 18:39 - David;: Is this not just the cold episode?
24/11/2019, 18:42 - David;: Seven worlds one nip
24/11/2019, 18:46 - Rob;: Nah every one so far has had a cold bit
24/11/2019, 18:46 - Paul;: Haven‚Äôt watched any of them. Any good? As good as planet earth?
24/11/2019, 18:48 - Rob;: No it's a step down from Planet Earth or Blue Planet
24/11/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Bit still good. Just maybe lacking variety, despite suggesting it's full of variety
24/11/2019, 18:49 - Paul;: I won‚Äôt be investing
24/11/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Big on seals, walruses, and prey Vs Hunter chases
24/11/2019, 18:50 - David;: Never like any wildlife shows set in urban environments
24/11/2019, 18:50 - David;: Stop trying to ruined my nature/culture distinction
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Yeah they're shit
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Koalas are fucked then
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Paul;: I‚Äôve never watched the human planet urban episode
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Functionally extinct
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Can't come back from that
24/11/2019, 18:52 - David;: Ah what?
24/11/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: Nah mate
24/11/2019, 18:53 - David;: How did we drop the ball on the koala so hard?
24/11/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: Yeah, they were fucked already, then this year's huge wildfires have wiped out 80% of their habitat
24/11/2019, 18:53 - Phill: My adrenal gland gets too fatigued watching seven world's 1 cup. Too my peril.
24/11/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Too much peril"
24/11/2019, 18:54 - David;: Nah they'll be fine
24/11/2019, 18:54 - David;: 20% you can make do with that
24/11/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: But the 100% we had before was already shit
24/11/2019, 18:54 - David;: If someone only left me one of the 5 rooms I the flat i would be annoyed but deal with it
24/11/2019, 18:55 - David;: Wouldn't kill me
24/11/2019, 18:55 - Phill: The koala looks like the kind of thing that's due for extinction.
24/11/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: Basically it's the point now where there's not enough genetic diversity left. And the trends that are destroying their habit are intensifying not lessening
24/11/2019, 18:55 - Phill: Your dodos. Your kakapos.
24/11/2019, 18:56 - David;: Expose them to radiation to force mutations and expend the gene pool again?
24/11/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: That wouldn't help you have non-inbred kids, but it would help you get cancer
24/11/2019, 18:58 - Rob;: Hard to make a population more disease resistant by upping their rate of cancer
24/11/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: That said, the Chernobyl exclusion zone has been brilliant for nature.
24/11/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: Humans worse than cancer
24/11/2019, 19:03 - Paul;: I want the koala. Very wizened. Should work on bringing them back
24/11/2019, 19:07 - David;: >the lynx
24/11/2019, 19:07 - David;: Not big enough to be a proper big cat but not small enough to be a house cat
24/11/2019, 19:10 - Rob;: I prefer an ocelot

24/11/2019, 20:23 - David;: In just 20 years' time, the average office worker will have a hunched back, protruding stomach and sore eyes, according to a life-sized doll developed as part of a report into workplace health.
24/11/2019, 20:23 - David;: Makes it seem like the doll was making the prediction
24/11/2019, 20:24 - Paul;: They developed the doll to make the prediction but in turn it predicted itself
24/11/2019, 20:26 - Paul;: Do some people not have daemons? Or does everyone get one?
24/11/2019, 20:34 - Damian Rumble: Everyone
24/11/2019, 20:34 - Damian Rumble: But they seem a bit inconsistent whether they show them or not
24/11/2019, 20:35 - Paul;: Yeah re the bar fight
24/11/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: I think for cost reasons they are just pretending everyone has a mouse in their pocket
24/11/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Lol
24/11/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: That guy has a little lizard
24/11/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: So shit small animals
24/11/2019, 20:38 - Stefan;: Always good when there's a dramatic shot of  powerful people marching along a corridor, but there's a bird, dog, weasel and butterfly following them
24/11/2019, 20:38 - David;: Naturally he had a vole behind his neck at the time
24/11/2019, 20:38 - Rob;: Yeah, I think using them sparingly
24/11/2019, 20:38 - Rob;: ...is best
24/11/2019, 20:39 - Paul;: You‚Äôre daemon is actually the parasitic fish that lives in the urethra
24/11/2019, 20:39 - Rob;: Welcome to the boardroom everyone, please is more this rhino
24/11/2019, 20:39 - Rob;: *excuse this
24/11/2019, 20:41 - Paul;: What‚Äôs the max size on a daemon ?
24/11/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: There's no rule in the book against having a blue whale
24/11/2019, 20:42 - Stefan;: Depends what the latest Daemon Regulations say
24/11/2019, 20:42 - Stefan;: Must be a lot of micro-regulation by the Magisterium
24/11/2019, 20:42 - Damian Rumble: I've got no idea who this guy who occasionally travels to our universe is. He wasn't in the books right?
24/11/2019, 20:44 - Rob;: Lord Boreal, he is
24/11/2019, 20:44 - Rob;: I think he's the man stalking them in the mufela world in Amber Spyglass
24/11/2019, 20:44 - Stefan;: Yeah he's mainly in the second book but they've brought a lot of that forward in the series
24/11/2019, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Ah... Useful info
24/11/2019, 20:46 - Paul;: I don‚Äôt like this link to the real world
24/11/2019, 20:56 - Rob;: Looking him up, he's not. That's another magisterium guy with a snake daemon
24/11/2019, 20:57 - David;: I'm just going to let all the epis come out and then watch them back to back
24/11/2019, 20:58 - Rob;: Assuming they're splitting into 3 series
24/11/2019, 20:59 - David;: Can't be dealing with it too much to take on
24/11/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: If not it'll go on for ages
24/11/2019, 20:59 - David;: How are Wolves suddenly 5th - has anyone audited this? They were ded
24/11/2019, 21:03 - Damian Rumble: I can't really remember too much about that last two couple of books but there's alot of content there. Three hopefully they don't cancel after the first part like they did with the movie version
24/11/2019, 21:03 - Paul;: The movie was shit though
24/11/2019, 21:04 - Paul;: They johnned it
24/11/2019, 21:05 - Damian Rumble: Straight into war of the worlds now ... Yaaas
24/11/2019, 21:06 - Damian Rumble: It's just the way it was too long so they opted not to bother finish the first book. Ending right before the climax
24/11/2019, 21:28 - David;: And it was raw shit
24/11/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Yeah it was dump
24/11/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: They removed all the religious elements
24/11/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: Just don't let Americans near our books

Some LibDem drama from my neighbourhood
25/11/2019, 18:38 - Stefan;: He made references to ‚Äúhot young boys‚Äù and ‚Äúwhiny bitches‚Äù
25/11/2019, 18:39 - Stefan;: His choice PR response when this all came to light: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on Grindr too, you know. I bet if you find something good on there you‚Äôll make the nationals"
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Damian Rumble: I've meet that guy. He was the hackney campaign coordinator for us for quite a few years
25/11/2019, 18:43 - Damian Rumble: Really stupid thing to tweet
25/11/2019, 19:22 - Phill: Lol just catching up on QT
25/11/2019, 19:23 - Paul;: People seem to be incredibly retarded when using social media

25/11/2019, 19:36 - Phill: That's where she stores her hypocrisy.
25/11/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: According to Damian everything is going perfectly because people are criticising the past which means their current strategy couldn‚Äôt be better

25/11/2019, 20:04 - Paul;: Both but more so Michael mccintyre
25/11/2019, 20:04 - Paul;: Peter Kay as well back in the day
25/11/2019, 21:14 - David;: Yeah Mccintye

25/11/2019, 21:17 - David;: Russell Howard

25/11/2019, 21:23 - Paul;: Who was that little gnome like guy from mock the week who is completely shit
25/11/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: Never said anything funny
25/11/2019, 21:26 - David;: andy parsons?
25/11/2019, 21:26 - Paul;: Yeah
25/11/2019, 21:27 - David;: Russell Howard annoyed me more
25/11/2019, 21:27 - David;: The relentless blandness and inanity
25/11/2019, 22:50 - David;: Ah, the newsnight thing on trans. Knob cut out of your arm and grafted on. Then wants to go back to female
25/11/2019, 23:05 - Stefan;: Are they reporting on people who detransition? It's a miniscule proportion. And used by some to make transition look like some kind of superficial fad
25/11/2019, 23:27 - David;: Yes although they pointed that out
25/11/2019, 23:28 - David;: They were going into the ethics of transitioning before puberty, adolescence etc.
25/11/2019, 23:30 - David;: Saying should you give people talking therapy first before they can access hormone therapy, as it can be entangled with other mental health issues, or is that stigmatising it
25/11/2019, 23:33 - David;: But the main thing I took away was the knob cut from the arm
25/11/2019, 23:36 - Stefan;: Yeah that's an area of legit debate. Problem is all the anti-trans bullshit in the media that politicises what's essentially a healthcare issue. Might watch to see how the bbc deal with it
25/11/2019, 23:37 - Stefan;: Didn't know they could make one from an arm - genius. thought it had to be the belly fat
26/11/2019, 00:18 - Damian Rumble: Pelicans. What a load of pricks. (Ref. Seven worlds)

26/11/2019, 07:30 - Rob;: Yeah I thought that. Like having a feeding strategy that involved waiting for someone to buy crisps, then pinching each individual crisp from their hand
26/11/2019, 07:30 - Rob;: Just get your own crisps you big beaked cunts
26/11/2019, 07:31 - Rob;: Do they hook it up with appropriate blood flow so you get an erection?
26/11/2019, 07:41 - Paul;: Can you opt for using your entire arm as the transplant?

26/11/2019, 14:53 - / James Ball: I was at London zoo once, looking at the pelicans. There happened to be a heron that had also flown into the enclosure. The very Essex mum talking to her young daughter next to me: "awww look at them pelicans, they's nice burds ain't they? Aww an look at the baby one there"

 herons are now forever baby pelicans in my head...
26/11/2019, 14:54 - Paul;: Ball ball
26/11/2019, 14:55 - / James Ball: And on that note, I was working in shoreditch this past weekend and went past a bar called ballie ballerson. It's a very hipster bar full of ball pits. I felt like going in and claiming I was the owner
26/11/2019, 14:56 - Paul;: Hi, Ball Ball of Ballie Ballerson
26/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: A mate had their birthday there
26/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: The novelty wears off extremely quickly and you realise it's just very inconvenient
26/11/2019, 14:58 - Rob;: Balls everywhere
26/11/2019, 14:58 - / James Ball: And presumably very grotty. I can't believe they clean the balls very often

26/11/2019, 15:00 - Damian Rumble: Too hipster
26/11/2019, 15:15 - David;: Lol Everton might get Moyes back again
26/11/2019, 15:16 - David;: Can't wean themselves off the Moyes teat
26/11/2019, 15:25 - Jack G;: Surprised he still has football manager career prospects

27/11/2019, 08:43 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
27/11/2019, 14:49 - David;: Why does Emery never unclench his teeth?
27/11/2019, 14:53 - Rob;: Why does he play such terrible football?
27/11/2019, 14:54 - David;: He opens his mouth without opening his teeth
27/11/2019, 14:54 - David;: Just worked out that's why he looks so odd
27/11/2019, 14:55 - Rob;: Good ebening
27/11/2019, 14:56 - David;: Arsenal could really do with Poch - but that will never happen?
27/11/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: It's probably unlikely for the rivalry reason
27/11/2019, 14:57 - David;: Would actually ironically fit the club brilliantly
27/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: But you'd have said that about Sol Campbell
27/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: Yeah I think so
27/11/2019, 14:58 - Rob;: He's a good defensive coach and good on a second rate budget
27/11/2019, 14:58 - Jack G;: Doesn‚Äôt Poch have a clause where he gets paid off ¬£12 million by Spurs for the sacking, but if he gets another job within 6 months then he has to forfeit it?
27/11/2019, 15:01 - David;: Not sure Poch would go there as a respect to spurs thing
27/11/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: Yeah, to go directly is a bit of a fuck you
27/11/2019, 16:26 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
27/11/2019, 16:26 - Rob;: And we employed him looking to improve
27/11/2019, 16:31 - Jack G;: That‚Äôs pretty poor. Not surprising though when he sets up with a back 5 at home against a Southampton side in the relegation zone
27/11/2019, 16:31 - Rob;: Yeah it makes no sense
27/11/2019, 16:31 - Rob;: He invites pressure onto a weak defence
27/11/2019, 16:32 - Rob;: And leaves quality attacking players isolated
27/11/2019, 16:32 - Rob;: Plays completely to his squad's weaknesses
27/11/2019, 16:43 - David;: Although he might say you have a shit defence and good forwards so try to bolster the defence and hope the forwards put away the few chances you do create?
27/11/2019, 16:44 - David;: The shot difference thing could be a result of trying to keep things tighter knowing you have clinical strikers?
27/11/2019, 16:47 - Rob;: Yes, and 5 at the back if the full backs go forward a lot could do that, but it never seems to work on the pitch how you would hope
27/11/2019, 16:48 - Rob;: This is actually our highest ever number of shots given away per game since those stats started being collected, so it's not actually keeping things tight at all
27/11/2019, 16:49 - David;: Yeah, it's obviously not working but could be the squad balance and players as well as tactics
27/11/2019, 16:49 - Jack G;: Emery‚Äôs tactics seem to want to play everything from wide though, nothing through the middle. Very easy to defend against
27/11/2019, 16:49 - David;: I don't think David Luiz was the answer to any of your problems
27/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Yeah, so the one difference to the summer I would behave made would have been a better cemtrehalf, but I think that was meant to be Saliba and we have to wait until next season for him
27/11/2019, 16:50 - David;: I think if he's going to play the way he is it's baffling they haven't prioritised full backs/wing backs
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Jack G;: A better manager could get far more from this squad.
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Bellerin and Tierney are both good, but have been unlikely both have been injured until recently
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: *unlucky
27/11/2019, 16:52 - David;: Is Tierney that good? Been playing in the SPL, hard to know yet
27/11/2019, 16:52 - David;: Bit yeah true unlucky with bellerin
27/11/2019, 16:53 - Rob;: He's been a long term target for sure. Not a stop gap
27/11/2019, 16:54 - David;: Havent seen enough of him. It's a big step up from spl to prem will probably take him at least a season to adjust
27/11/2019, 16:55 - David;: What's theoretically your best defence - Bellerin, Sokratis, Luiz, Tierney?
27/11/2019, 17:00 - Rob;: I think Rob Holding is better than one of those centre halves, but that would be Emery's choice I think, yeah
27/11/2019, 17:00 - Rob;: Chambers also looks good when he plays
27/11/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: I'd imagine Holding and Saliba are the long-term plan from next season
27/11/2019, 17:09 - Jack G;: You should be in for doucour√©, sure he‚Äôd fancy moving on from Watford

27/11/2019, 20:17 - David;: It's the vaping bollocks all over again
27/11/2019, 20:18 - David;: People taking up vaping without a prior nicotine addiction. Then find it's potentially more dangerous than smoking.
27/11/2019, 20:18 - / James Ball: That's big tobacco talking
27/11/2019, 20:19 - David;: But weren't big tobacco also selling the vapes?
27/11/2019, 20:19 - / James Ball: They were slow to market
27/11/2019, 20:19 - / James Ball: Missed the main vape hype
27/11/2019, 20:19 - David;: Pretty sure tobacco stocks fell with all the health scares
27/11/2019, 20:19 - Paul;: Yes, invested a few billion over the summer in juul then it fucked them
27/11/2019, 20:20 - Paul;: They also already owned other brands
27/11/2019, 20:20 - David;: It is rather amusing that

27/11/2019, 20:25 - David;: Would be good to roll that out en masse to test
27/11/2019, 20:25 - David;: Market it as the safe alternative to vaping
27/11/2019, 20:26 - David;: The smell always takes me back to laser quest in oxford

27/11/2019, 20:26 - David;: Fine, sounds lovely
27/11/2019, 20:26 - Paul;: To the alternatives
27/11/2019, 20:27 - Paul;: Until you‚Äôre back to smoking tobacco
27/11/2019, 20:27 - / James Ball: Vaping = smoke machines
27/11/2019, 20:28 - / James Ball: I still think it's ridiculous to start vaping nicotine when you don't smoke
27/11/2019, 20:28 - David;: Yeah that's what I don't understand. Completely on board with people using it to quit smoking
27/11/2019, 20:29 - David;: But they've created an addiction where none existed. Would be funny if lots of those people now transition to smoking in response to the health scare
27/11/2019, 20:29 - David;: Huge self-troll
27/11/2019, 20:29 - / James Ball: I know people that have done that

27/11/2019, 20:32 - Rob;: The huge troll
27/11/2019, 20:33 - Damian Rumble: I was under the impression that some US manufacturers were exploiting poor regulations to use some shitty oil instead of glycine, and it killed a bunch of people, hence the "vaping is worse than smoking" rumour came about
27/11/2019, 20:33 - Damian Rumble: (note vaping probably still not a good idea)
27/11/2019, 20:35 - Paul;: There‚Äôs no regulation around ingredients
27/11/2019, 20:35 - Paul;: And it‚Äôs vitamin e or something they used that is binding to the lungs
27/11/2019, 20:37 - Damian Rumble: I really love having my lungs bound
27/11/2019, 20:38 - David;: Lol, something I really seek out in a product
27/11/2019, 20:40 - Damian Rumble: the freer the market, the more gunk in my lungs
27/11/2019, 20:41 - David;: I'll just stick to established psychedelics and moderate boozing

27/11/2019, 20:45 - David;: 1917 then

27/11/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: Googled it and the release date said jan
27/11/2019, 20:47 - David;: Yeah yeah but the trailer
27/11/2019, 20:47 - Rob;: Ah ok
27/11/2019, 20:47 - David;: And already being ripped for an oscar
27/11/2019, 20:47 - David;: Rave reviews
27/11/2019, 20:47 - Rob;: An everyone loves a war
27/11/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: We can all watch and imagine we're there, which would be better than being in the EU
27/11/2019, 20:48 - David;: Yeah we want to get back to the good old days of trench warfare
27/11/2019, 20:49 - David;: Before all the health and safety regulation kicked in
27/11/2019, 20:50 - Rob;: When I was young I died at the Somme. Better, simpler time.
27/11/2019, 20:57 - Stefan;: These days you can't even lead a doomed generation of men to their mechanical slaughter
27/11/2019, 20:57 - Stefan;: Political correctness gone mad
27/11/2019, 21:01 - David;: Just read Siegfried Sassoon memoirs of an infantry officer. Huge book

27/11/2019, 22:00 - Phill: Lol just thinking that
27/11/2019, 22:01 - David;: How is he famous enough to dominate the BBC headlines for hours
27/11/2019, 22:01 - David;: Born Vivian James in 1939, he moved to England in 1961 and rose to prominence as a literary critic and TV columnist. He went on to deliver wry commentary on international programming in such shows as Clive James On Television.

27/11/2019, 22:19 - Hamish Sinclair: What happened to the lib dem surge?
27/11/2019, 22:19 - Phill: They did surge. Backwards.
27/11/2019, 22:19 - Damian Rumble: Nigel Farage.
27/11/2019, 22:20 - Damian Rumble: Personally said he feared the lib dems would take Tory seats so pulled he men out to give conservatives a free run
27/11/2019, 22:21 - Phill: >dodging the fact that they're actually a piece of shit
27/11/2019, 22:22 - Stefan;: This is a "nowcast" rather than a forecast, there's still 2 weeks for the polls to move. But it's not looking great
27/11/2019, 22:26 - Damian Rumble: If the Tories get a majority and drive off a cliff at the end of 2020 then I'm moving to Singapore
27/11/2019, 22:26 - Damian Rumble: *drive us off
27/11/2019, 22:27 - Rob;: Why chose the place they want to turn us into?
27/11/2019, 22:27 - Phill: üòÜ
27/11/2019, 22:28 - Damian Rumble: I can get a job there easily and spend a couple of years earning a tonne of money and lounge on a beach in Bali to ride out the storm
27/11/2019, 22:28 - Phill: So why not do it anyway?
27/11/2019, 22:31 - Phill: Isn't is a tax haven? Thought you hated the idea of tax havens?
27/11/2019, 22:32 - Rob;: 2500 km between Singapore and bali. That's a bit like saying you love living in London because you can lounge on a beach in Italy
27/11/2019, 22:34 - Damian Rumble: That's what weekends are for
27/11/2019, 22:37 - Rob;: Oh I seeee, you're ok with ruining the environment too
27/11/2019, 22:38 - Phill: Reeks of liberal elite hypocricy in here
27/11/2019, 22:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Dat carbon footprint doh
27/11/2019, 23:13 - David;: This does rather demonstrate the fact the lib Dems = tories
27/11/2019, 23:22 - David;: BBC News - Ketamine may reduce heavy drinkers' craving
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50548103
27/11/2019, 23:22 - David;: 'When the sedative was used to disrupt people's memories of why they wanted to drink, they drank less'
27/11/2019, 23:23 - David;: Seems medically sound
28/11/2019, 00:06 - Damian Rumble: er how?
28/11/2019, 06:18 - Paul;: Damo just vote Tory and do yourself a favour
28/11/2019, 08:14 - Rob;: Saying at least I'll be ok because I can move to a tax haven and earn lots of money while enjoying polluting the planet at weekend then not seeing how it could sound rather Tory like is definitely the most Tory thing I've heard this election
28/11/2019, 09:06 - / James Ball: Damian "I'm alright jack" rumble
28/11/2019, 09:12 - / James Ball: I'm staying in chippy this week as I'm needing to commute into Oxford everyday for work. Big vape has hit chippy - there's now a vape shop on the high street
28/11/2019, 09:17 - Phill: Spot on.
28/11/2019, 09:31 - Damian Rumble: 1) me potentially to Singapore is not lib Dem policy. Those two things are unrelated.
2) I am going out canvasing this evening to win seats off of Tories in areas labour cannot win. What are you doing?
3) if Boris is returned with a massive majority it will be due to Labour collapsing in the north/west midlands, areas the lib Dems have traditionally been weak. 

Rather than berating me for trying to save the country why don't you get out there and do something about it
28/11/2019, 10:04 - / James Ball: I would argue that none of the political parties at the moment are capable of saving the country. All current options are viewed as very bad by large proportions of the country. All the campaigning in the world is not going to get the lib dems near to government this time around. Sadly the vast majority of people vote blindly, short sightedly or are misled. The best hope of dethroning the Tories is to vote labour and not dilute the anti-tory vote any more.
28/11/2019, 10:10 - Hamish Sinclair: We're all fucked
28/11/2019, 10:11 - Hamish Sinclair: I ended up diving into a far right/Britain first twitter hole yesterday and now I'm totally depressed
28/11/2019, 10:11 - Rob;: The system is not built for having both major parties severely fuck it at the same time
28/11/2019, 10:18 - David;: Xhaka's back for the Europa league game though Rob - not all bad news.
28/11/2019, 10:18 - Rob;: That'll be an interesting atmosphere for sure. Reduced crowd capacity and no away fans due to Frankfurt being cunts
28/11/2019, 10:21 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/snooker/50584388
28/11/2019, 10:22 - David;: I prefer a flan
28/11/2019, 10:50 - Paul;: Damo the tax exile. Tories not lenient enough for him. Demands better tax rates and more pollution to reach a baseline of satisfaction
28/11/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Tammy Abraham injured
28/11/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: I'll get taxed a huge 0.5 points to sell
28/11/2019, 11:52 - Paul;: Fuck
28/11/2019, 11:53 - David;: Heard it is more minor than originally thought?
28/11/2019, 11:53 - Rob;: Rated as 50% chance, which might just mean a game or two
28/11/2019, 11:53 - Rob;: Yeah he's playing it down
28/11/2019, 11:54 - David;: Wow, Johnson actually refusing to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, well known Tory journalist. üêì
28/11/2019, 11:55 - David;: If Corbyn had done that you'd never hear the end of it.
28/11/2019, 12:01 - David;: Lol and this column that has come to light: '[Johnson] suggested it was ‚Äúfeeble‚Äù for a man to be unable or unwilling to ‚Äútake control of his woman‚Äù, arguing Britain needed to ‚Äúrestore women‚Äôs desire to be married‚Äù. BBC obviously not even picking up on that.
28/11/2019, 12:09 - Stefan;: Even worse, they assured Labour that Johnson would do an interview too  - Corbyn wouldn't have agreed to it otherwise
28/11/2019, 12:10 - Stefan;: Doesn't really matter whether it's bias or incompetence, the end result is the same - they're failing to hold the Tories to account
28/11/2019, 12:15 - David;: BBC have been woeful
28/11/2019, 12:15 - David;: Also the prominence given to anti-semitism claims vs barely reporting the Muslim Council statement.
28/11/2019, 12:17 - Rob;: They should just do an amazing empty chair interview and ask incredibly loaded questions of it
28/11/2019, 12:17 - David;: Yeah - 'So you're refusing to apologise?' over and over again at the chair
28/11/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: 'So empty chair, please stay silent if you admit your policies led directly to the Grenfell fire'
28/11/2019, 12:18 - Hamish Sinclair: It baffles me how the tories decision to duck debates on all of the last 3 elections hasn't got them more critiscism
28/11/2019, 12:19 - Jack G;: People don‚Äôt care as long as they get brexit
28/11/2019, 12:19 - Rob;: I loved that there was that Sky panel where every party sent a man, then the greens, who have prominent women but also sent a man, boycotted it because bit was all male
28/11/2019, 12:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Hows Manchester voting jack?
28/11/2019, 12:21 - Hamish Sinclair: You're our man in the north
28/11/2019, 12:21 - David;: It also baffles me how the BBC report statements from faith leaders as disinterested. Clearly leading Jewish organisatios are more likely to have sympaties with Israel and so likely to oppose a more pro-palestine foreign policy.
28/11/2019, 12:22 - David;: They therefore have an interest in saying things that make Labour being elected less likely.
28/11/2019, 12:23 - Jack G;: Big on labour up in Manchester, lots of safe labour seats
28/11/2019, 12:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Are brexit party a big thing up there?
28/11/2019, 12:24 - David;: Think that would be more the grotty satellite towns wouldnt it?
28/11/2019, 12:24 - David;: your Bolton's etc.
28/11/2019, 12:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah yeah yeah. Should do an analysis for correlation between  brexit party support and local football club debt
28/11/2019, 12:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Bolton

28/11/2019, 12:27 - David;: <Media omitted>
28/11/2019, 12:27 - David;: Lol my google maps somehow made 'great britain' appear as a small town just west of Halifax
28/11/2019, 12:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Isnt Doncaster up for grabs? The guardian tells me so
28/11/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: Yeah it always does that
28/11/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: Always gets me
28/11/2019, 12:29 - David;: Must be a lot of grot in Huddersfield
28/11/2019, 12:29 - David;: and Preston
28/11/2019, 12:29 - David;: Edgy night out in Preston

28/11/2019, 12:33 - Rob;: It would be funny if that's how it went, with every remain city becoming a city state in the EU
28/11/2019, 12:33 - Rob;: Huge borders everywhere, goods having to travel in and out of the EU 100 times on the way through the country
28/11/2019, 12:35 - Stefan;: Yeah and the chief rabbi speaks only for a certain group of orthodox Jews, and even then only as a figurehead. Nothing like the pope. He's a personal friend of Johnson.
28/11/2019, 12:35 - Stefan;: Ha me and a friend talked about this - you'd have armoured road/rail corridors between the cities, like the one from West Germany to west Berlin
28/11/2019, 12:36 - Rob;: Oxfordshire was in though, we'd have that
28/11/2019, 12:36 - Stefan;: Except Cherwell, my home district
28/11/2019, 12:36 - David;: Yeah exactly.
28/11/2019, 12:38 - David;: How small a level do you take it down to?
28/11/2019, 12:38 - David;: Like does Chippy potentially have a border with over norton?
28/11/2019, 12:39 - Stefan;: Street level
28/11/2019, 12:40 - Stefan;: You have to cross 7 international borders to get milk from the shop
28/11/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: I would have just said constituencies, since we have that data, but fine. House by house.

28/11/2019, 13:38 - Stefan;: Which will sit in his place, slowly melting
28/11/2019, 13:39 - Paul;: Is he against climate change?

03/12/2019, 20:25 - Rob;: Could spy on what the old bird's got me for Christmas
03/12/2019, 20:26 - Phill: That's when you see a long history of sex toy buying
03/12/2019, 20:26 - David;: Yeah I'm using fay's prime
03/12/2019, 20:27 - Rob;: What can I say, she buys me what I ask for
03/12/2019, 20:28 - David;: strong player interface
03/12/2019, 20:29 - David;: Commentary team seems quite own brand
03/12/2019, 20:30 - Paul;: Is it like a mark lacy / joe hill duo?
03/12/2019, 20:30 - David;: I mean I can't see their faces so it could actually be them
03/12/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: Yes I think it is them
03/12/2019, 20:32 - David;: Surprised more eyebrows weren't raised when that was announced
03/12/2019, 20:34 - David;: How much did just these 2 gameweeks set Amazon back?
03/12/2019, 20:41 - David;: Angelino = Shia Labeouf
03/12/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: They'll avoid it back in tax, don't worry
03/12/2019, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Yet we have to pay more to watch the same amount if games
03/12/2019, 20:46 - David;: Competition purely negative for the consumer
03/12/2019, 20:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah. The sky monopoly better value
03/12/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: Yeah, nothing like normal competition where you can get the whole product from the  provider you want
03/12/2019, 20:49 - Rob;: You wouldn't want supermarket competition to mean you couldn't get a full meal at any one shop
03/12/2019, 20:50 - David;: 'fuck sake, waitrose has bought the right to carrots but onions are still with sainsbury's'
03/12/2019, 20:50 - Rob;: 'sorry, Aldi own the rights to potatoes, but we do have cling film and swede'
03/12/2019, 20:51 - Rob;: Sorry mate, we have salt but not pepper
03/12/2019, 20:51 - David;: 'But also we had to bid through the roof to retain the Swede rights and have passed the costs on, so they will now cost you what you used to spend getting both potato and swede'
03/12/2019, 20:52 - Rob;: Your only other option is to go to the pub, where you get a free swede if you buy a pint every 45 minutes
03/12/2019, 20:53 - Rob;: But the pub is likely to out out of business as it can't afford the swede rights that are bringing all the customers in
03/12/2019, 20:54 - David;: Bog roll would be a very strategic product to aquire the rights to. When you need it there's no negotiation.
03/12/2019, 20:55 - Rob;: So Waitrose get it, but they have very few stores in the north
03/12/2019, 20:55 - David;: Yeah lol everyone has to commute miles.
03/12/2019, 20:58 - David;: So the amazon deal is the equivalen to some stationary shop suddenly aquiring the right to one completely vital food ingriedient. 'Fuck sake, Staples is moving into the groceries market and has bought the rights to bread and milk'
03/12/2019, 20:59 - David;: Or a clothes shop - suddenly I have to go to H and M to get butter.
03/12/2019, 21:00 - Rob;: Cucumbers exclusively in Ann Summers
03/12/2019, 21:00 - David;: 'and they're only doing it to drive footfall into their dildo subscription service'

03/12/2019, 21:38 - David;: You must have scurvy by now
03/12/2019, 21:38 - Rob;: Ah Stefan, hard to come back from this
03/12/2019, 22:27 - Rob;: Apparently you can get an 'stadium atmosphere' audio mode on Amazon, where you lose the commentary
03/12/2019, 22:29 - David;: So at the Emirates that's just a mute button?
03/12/2019, 22:29 - David;: Hib
03/12/2019, 22:29 - Rob;: I did almost make that joke myself
03/12/2019, 22:30 - Rob;: But I think you'll find the away fans are very vocal, David
03/12/2019, 22:31 - David;: Do we know anything about ljungberg as a coach?
03/12/2019, 22:32 - David;: I saw Wenger was offering to help. The kiss of death
03/12/2019, 22:32 - Rob;: Not really, this is his first time as a head coach
03/12/2019, 22:33 - Rob;: People seem to like him, and quite a lot was made of his work moving through the ranks at Arsenal
03/12/2019, 22:33 - Rob;: But style wise, I think it might take a while to see
03/12/2019, 22:34 - Rob;: I think it's fairly unlikely he will be made permanent head coach unless he blows everyone's bollocks off
03/12/2019, 22:34 - David;: I've never seen a managerial short list with such disparate styles and directions
03/12/2019, 22:36 - David;: Allegri, Benitez, Poch, Vieira, Howe
03/12/2019, 22:36 - David;: All very different
03/12/2019, 22:36 - Rob;: I would take the lists of candidates with a pinch of salt
03/12/2019, 22:37 - David;: And arteta, don't know much about what he would be like
03/12/2019, 22:41 - David;: I'd just take a Nuno. Strong beard. What's the worst that can happen?

04/12/2019, 19:30 - David;: Games everywhere
04/12/2019, 19:31 - David;: Say what you like about Mourinho he does wear a strong coat
04/12/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: Time to drop salah I think
04/12/2019, 19:57 - Paul;: Fuck off is Abraham back

04/12/2019, 20:20 - Damian Rumble: Lol
04/12/2019, 20:21 - Damian Rumble: How much value did you loose transfering him?
04/12/2019, 20:36 - Rob;: How pink is Michael Keane?
04/12/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: Mild goal from Origi there
04/12/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: A quantum of goal
04/12/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Its filth
04/12/2019, 20:53 - David;: He only does huge goals
04/12/2019, 20:53 - David;: Derby's, champo league finals
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Definitely couldn't do it on  a windy wednesday in stoke
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Unless it was the chamions league final
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Rob;: He's the opposite of the guy who chooses 30 perineum goals a season
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Always looks suprised to have scored aswell
04/12/2019, 20:55 - Rob;: Haha, the Britannia wins the Champions League but insists it's moved to a Tuesday night in November
04/12/2019, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Its how they would want it
04/12/2019, 20:56 - Rob;: 'The match has been postponed. It's just to balmy out there'
04/12/2019, 20:57 - David;: I do miss the concept of Pulis's Stoke
04/12/2019, 21:05 - Damian Rumble: I don't. I hope they relegated to division 1 this year. I would love that.
04/12/2019, 21:06 - Paul;: Lol the hate of stoke
04/12/2019, 21:13 - David;: The Pukki party is back on
04/12/2019, 21:14 - Rob;: Could you get him now the initial hype has subsided?
04/12/2019, 21:15 - David;: Yeah it's an option now the buzz has subsided
04/12/2019, 21:22 - David;: Is great being able to stream all games like this. The prem should sell a direct package. Cut out all the middle men.
04/12/2019, 21:23 - David;: So ¬£30 a month or whatever to stream all games.
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Rob;: You'd still have the rules about 3pm games being ineligible for broadcast though
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Phill: Such a shit dated rule
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Rob;: Having all the fixtures now unique to midweek rounds like this
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: Change the rules
04/12/2019, 21:25 - Rob;: It's done to protect attendances
04/12/2019, 21:25 - Paul;: Why can‚Äôt they have regional variance
04/12/2019, 21:25 - David;: Yeah fuck that
04/12/2019, 21:26 - David;: Don't need it now
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: And not just at prem clubs - so people go out to support their local club at 3om
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Paul;: If stoke Everton is on I might want to watch. Would never attend
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Phill: Need evidence to show it actually does
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Phill: If they can throw a VAR in they can test the 3pm rule
04/12/2019, 21:26 - David;: Fair to believe people who go to lower league football would stop because a a streaming service was set up
04/12/2019, 21:27 - David;: *fail to
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Phill: >supporting your local club
04/12/2019, 21:28 - Paul;: How many Oxford United game‚Äôs did you all go to
04/12/2019, 21:28 - David;: If you bleed Barnsley you're not going to pie it off because Palace Wolves is now available to stream online
04/12/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: It's the small clubs that don't want it, for whom having 20% of the gate receipt staying at home to watch a televised game every week might send them bankrupt
04/12/2019, 21:30 - Paul;: Just give them 50 quid as part of the deal and be done with it
04/12/2019, 21:30 - Paul;: Next
04/12/2019, 21:30 - David;: Give them a cut of the rights
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Paul;: Do we even need these clubs. Surely time to unplug and let them die
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: Well yeah, they could do that, a football tax system for the many not the few
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Paul;: Keeping all these zombie clubs afloat
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: Cut off the roots and hope the tree survives
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Jack G;: I bet you love the idea of the European super league
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Paul;: Good to prune the weeds

04/12/2019, 21:32 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Sounds shite
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Logistically terrible
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Jack G;: But you don‚Äôt want small clubs
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Champ league is that anyway really
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Jack G;: So just take the richest
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: No, I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs probably time to let the right ones go and we get a streaming service
04/12/2019, 21:34 - David;: It's fair to say well you play a role in developing the players and teams that feed the prem so we'll give you 5% of the revenues to offset any attendence decline
04/12/2019, 21:34 - Paul;: They won‚Äôt be missed
04/12/2019, 21:35 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/12/2019, 21:35 - Jack G;: Lord Bob lord
04/12/2019, 21:37 - David;: Successfully convinced
04/12/2019, 21:38 - David;: So we've just been taking it as red all these years because old Bob Lord said it 60 years ago
04/12/2019, 21:39 - Paul;: Do you think it made a huge difference to the 30 die hards turning up at division 6 games in the deep winter
04/12/2019, 21:40 - Paul;: Always were going to be there. Fuck the small clubs
04/12/2019, 21:57 - Rob;: Everton were so heavily tipped to have a good start to the season
04/12/2019, 21:57 - Rob;: Wasted all their easy fixtures
05/12/2019, 09:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Dave is your election poster still in place?

05/12/2019, 21:13 - David;: You've stolen my bounce!
05/12/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, someone's got our fucking bounce
05/12/2019, 21:44 - David;: But that's your bounce. By right.
05/12/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. It's in the contract. Give us the bounce
05/12/2019, 21:48 - Jack G;: Don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll beat us easily on Monday. The bounce is coming
05/12/2019, 21:51 - David;: West Ham the one game universal bounce
05/12/2019, 21:51 - David;: Pellegrini must be ded surely
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Jack G;: He got some credit in the bank for beating Chelsea so not quite yet
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Rob;: Brighton shitting on the bounce
05/12/2019, 21:53 - David;: This is the opposite of a bounce
05/12/2019, 21:53 - David;: The sink
05/12/2019, 21:53 - David;: The sag
05/12/2019, 21:54 - Phill: Maupay, Maupay, Maupaycheck for a bounce
05/12/2019, 21:54 - Jack G;: The wilt
05/12/2019, 21:56 - Rob;: Maybe Pardew will get our bounce, wherever he is now
05/12/2019, 21:57 - David;: Unclear what Ljungberg is for
05/12/2019, 21:57 - Phill: He like a merlot
05/12/2019, 22:00 - David;: Yeah, you didn't have the spine to choose a grape with any distinctive characteristics so you ended up with it.
05/12/2019, 22:00 - Jack G;: Which managers are you rumoured to be looking at Rob?
05/12/2019, 22:01 - Rob;: Oh the rumours are everyone
05/12/2019, 22:01 - Jack G;: Big Sam? Always good for a relegation battle
05/12/2019, 22:01 - David;: Nuno have a shortlist yet?
05/12/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: I think truly the club is being run so poorly that they've sacked Emery without having thought about who next, despite there being more than a year of worrying form in during which to think
05/12/2019, 22:02 - Phill: <Media omitted>
05/12/2019, 22:07 - David;: Ljungberg really pisses me off

05/12/2019, 22:13 - Rob;: I am not a fan of him doing a Pardew and losing his free bounce

06/12/2019, 19:12 - Sam;: Lol. Season review DVD, just had to keep it together.
06/12/2019, 19:13 - David;: They'd escaped relegation against the odds as well. Just had to not say weird shit
06/12/2019, 19:14 - Sam;: Such a low bar for success
06/12/2019, 19:14 - Sam;: But they let it through? Or is it leaked?

06/12/2019, 19:17 - David;: Pinning a player down by the throat
06/12/2019, 19:19 - David;: "There's part of you that suspects Pearson was secretly delighted to be attacked by a pack of wild dogs. There's part of you that suspects he went on holiday with that express intention."
06/12/2019, 19:20 - Sam;: Speaking of fucking up easy situations. The Italian newspaper that went with the headline ‚ÄúBlack Friday‚Äù to preview the inter vs Roma match tonight

10/12/2019, 21:40 - David;: >Charizard. So mainstream
10/12/2019, 21:41 - David;: Remember Hamish swapping a shiny for a sycther for purely tactical deck building reasons
10/12/2019, 21:42 - Rob;: It was a good marketing thing really wasn't it, make something insanely desirable on both a collectible and to a lesser extent tactical level
10/12/2019, 21:43 - David;: Yeah, they really did marketting
10/12/2019, 21:44 - Phill: Just desirable to children proliferated via word of mouth rather than online was enough
10/12/2019, 21:44 - Phill: Perceptibaly collectible
10/12/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: Lots of levels to engage with it
10/12/2019, 21:44 - Phill: Nowadays you'd just buy a charizard online. Trade it for a FIFA card.

10/12/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Yeah, not a collectible in the sense of retaining any value, but very collectable in that there was something to complete
10/12/2019, 21:46 - Phill: Tfw you got shiny and unshiny dark charizard in 2 packs as part of the same pocket money purchase but no one cared.
10/12/2019, 21:46 - Stefan;: My greatest ever mistake in life was swapping a shiny Snorlax for a non-shiny Venomoth in year y

10/12/2019, 21:50 - Phill: Went to beanies galore in Witney on s regular basis
10/12/2019, 21:50 - David;: Why did he prioritise the fossil set?
10/12/2019, 21:51 - Phill: Because me and my brother were collecting the classic and rocket sets
10/12/2019, 21:51 - Phill: But he just trolled us by having money so owned us collecting
10/12/2019, 21:51 - Rob;: This is brilliant

12/12/2019, 23:47 - Hamish Sinclair: But they said their exit poll is from 20000 people. Which divided by 600 constuencys is like 30 per constineuncy
12/12/2019, 23:48 - David;: It's a few things. You're asking people right after voting so no undecideds etc. The sample is instantly correct to the turnout without any imputations or assumptions. You don't have to do demographic weighting.
12/12/2019, 23:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Dont understand how they make such an accurate poll per constituency
12/12/2019, 23:49 - David;: And you can do it for individual constituencies so don't have to model average swinga
12/12/2019, 23:49 - Phill: Indicates share of overall vote not seats
12/12/2019, 23:50 - Phill: Seat distribution can vary wildly with the same proportion of votes
12/12/2019, 23:50 - David;: We'll both the MRPs also said comfortable majority
12/12/2019, 23:51 - Phill: No poll indicated this level of butthurt
12/12/2019, 23:51 - Phill: McDonell was nursing visible anal wounds on screen
12/12/2019, 23:51 - David;: Yeah, MRP said 89
12/12/2019, 23:51 - Hamish Sinclair: But a majority has been on the card with a hung parliament just within the margin of error
12/12/2019, 23:52 - Phill: Ni
12/12/2019, 23:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Conservatives have been pumping out briefings about how close it is, but that's just to get the votes out
12/12/2019, 23:52 - Phill: No https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/10/general-election-swinson-says-johnsons-rhetoric-puts-eu-citizens-at-risk-of-hate-crimes-live
12/12/2019, 23:53 - David;: Yes, people were clinging on to outer end of margins of error for the few tightest polls
12/12/2019, 23:53 - David;: Very much predicted
12/12/2019, 23:53 - Rob;: I miss Theresa May. I liked that she was relatively ineffective at being a cunt
12/12/2019, 23:56 - Phill: Tory majy predicted. Nothing this large.
12/12/2019, 23:56 - David;: *68. But this was well within margin of error
12/12/2019, 23:57 - David;: And average poll lead was 10 points which translates to a big majority.
12/12/2019, 23:58 - Phill: Not necessarily in FPTP
12/12/2019, 23:58 - Phill: Either way I'm butthurt but going to revel in the trolling
12/12/2019, 23:58 - David;: Yes even in FPTP. When you get to around 5-7 then it depends on local spreads etc. But no one has ever failed to win a large majority with a +10% vote share
13/12/2019, 00:00 - Phill: Agree it points to a majority but the size of it is still on a largely unknown scale due to said local factors.
13/12/2019, 00:01 - Phill: There's no arguing that this is an significantly above average majority based on the pre election poll predictions
13/12/2019, 00:03 - David;: Only vs optimistic readings of the tightest polls. But whatever.
13/12/2019, 00:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, basically a hung parliament was as likely as this majority
13/12/2019, 00:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Opposite end of of the error margin
13/12/2019, 00:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Neither suprising
13/12/2019, 00:05 - Phill: But a hungy would have been surprising
13/12/2019, 00:06 - Hamish Sinclair: In hindsight yes.
13/12/2019, 00:06 - Phill: Are people honestly trying to tell me they weren't even a bit shocked at the scale of the majority on the exit poll.
13/12/2019, 00:06 - Phill: ?
13/12/2019, 00:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Disagree it would have been suprising. Anything within the error margins by definition not a suprise
13/12/2019, 00:23 - David;: 4-1
13/12/2019, 00:23 - David;: A hammering not sure what the fuss is about
13/12/2019, 00:24 - David;: Will be good to get some remain seats in
13/12/2019, 00:25 - Rob;: I'd 368-191 be a Labour fan right now
13/12/2019, 00:52 - Damian Rumble: Lol
13/12/2019, 00:52 - Damian Rumble: Need to get some real seats
13/12/2019, 00:53 - Damian Rumble: Announced
13/12/2019, 01:13 - Damian Rumble: >Workington man
13/12/2019, 07:07 - Rob;: >Swinson
13/12/2019, 07:09 - Phill: Bahahahahaha just woke up to Swineson losing her seat
13/12/2019, 07:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Chuka umunna also failed to take his seat
13/12/2019, 07:11 - Rob;: So many moderate Tories ded
13/12/2019, 07:11 - Hamish Sinclair: And the lib dems kindly split the vote in kensington
13/12/2019, 07:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Good to have them around
13/12/2019, 07:43 - Damian Rumble: Labour split the vote on the two seats I was campaigning in and let the Tories in ffs
13/12/2019, 07:44 - Damian Rumble: Love fptp. Improve your share of the vote by 50% Nationwide and get one less seat
13/12/2019, 08:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, would be interested to see how the results of elections would have changed if AV voting went through

13/12/2019, 09:17 - Damian Rumble: Turns out we lost 6 seats by less than 1,000 votes and Jo Swinson's by only 149. Its not going to stop Boris from fucking us all in the long term but its still a cruel blow...
13/12/2019, 09:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, impossible for SNP to now get 50 seats, we dont even get to see ruth Davidson swim naked. Shame
13/12/2019, 09:34 - Phill: Where get?
13/12/2019, 09:35 - Phill: It's a blue dawn, it's a blue day, it's a blue life for  me and I'm feeling gooood
13/12/2019, 09:49 - Rob;: You have to hand it to the Tories, taking an issue like Brexit that everyone though would destroy them, then using it to destroy 100-year labour strongholds
13/12/2019, 09:51 - Jack G;: Cameron has played a couple of blinders. IndyRef to take labour votes out of Scotland, now Brexit to take the northern strongholds off them too
13/12/2019, 10:11 - Paul;: Colleague brought them back from Finland
13/12/2019, 12:05 - Stefan;: And then to dismantle what's left of the NHS in a nice little US trade deal
13/12/2019, 12:06 - Stefan;: Can't wait to pay a few grand any time I need an ambulance
13/12/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Will they destroy the nhs?
13/12/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Is that a given?
13/12/2019, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: Probably the best time to ask these questions was before the election...

14/12/2019, 11:46 - Paul;: Corbyn not resigning straight away a sign of that?
14/12/2019, 11:46 - Rob;: Yeah, clearly an attempt to hold on and shape the leadership election
14/12/2019, 11:46 - Rob;: Momentum are mental
14/12/2019, 11:47 - Paul;: What is momentum exactly? Like a steering group within the party
14/12/2019, 11:47 - Paul;: But they‚Äôve taken over
14/12/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Yeah, a grassroots movement that's there to promote the leftwing of the labour party. Only been around since 2015
14/12/2019, 11:48 - Paul;: Ah so really they should just splinter off and become the momentum party then labour can finally get back to centre
14/12/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: It was so far left people found it easier to go right
14/12/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: Which is mad
14/12/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Well their aim is basically the opposite big that - to stop Labour moving central
14/12/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Yeah, fun thing about our politics at the moment. Can't quite vote for socialism, get relatively far right populism instead
14/12/2019, 11:51 - Paul;: Bishop Auckland unable to handle the left
14/12/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: What do. They need a northerner leading
14/12/2019, 11:57 - Paul;: What‚Äôs the guardian saying about it all
14/12/2019, 11:58 - Rob;: I've only read one 'what went wrong' post, and that didn't seem to be in denial
14/12/2019, 12:18 - Paul;: Bashing the beast of bolsover
14/12/2019, 12:21 - Hamish Sinclair: They need a working class leader not from a london constituency, ideally a woman
14/12/2019, 12:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Momentum are pretty fucking mental. I went to some meetings during the doctors strike and every single one ended in a vote for a general strike
14/12/2019, 12:22 - Rob;: Jess Phillips fits the bill, but I don't think a lot men aged 40+ would be able to deal with her being funnier than them
14/12/2019, 12:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Angela raynor
14/12/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: Can she eat a vindaloo and knock back 8 pints?
14/12/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: Phillips could
14/12/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: That should be the criteria
14/12/2019, 12:24 - Rob;: Get old cokehead Burnham back
14/12/2019, 12:24 - Rob;: (i don't actually want that)

14/12/2019, 13:24 - Damian Rumble: Would also be a very good option
14/12/2019, 13:24 - Damian Rumble: Are you going to join the labour party @447540496004 so you can vote for him?
14/12/2019, 13:25 - Hamish Sinclair: I think it highlights our ridiculous electoral system
14/12/2019, 13:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Similar to your point about lib dems upping their share of the vote by 50% and losing seats

14/12/2019, 13:27 - Paul;: If you didn‚Äôt have fptp do you eliminate constituencies?
14/12/2019, 13:27 - Damian Rumble: None of this would have happened if Labour had backed AV a few years back. Getting that referendum was the main reason to go into coalition with the tories
14/12/2019, 13:27 - Paul;: Doesn‚Äôt it work well for particularly local issues?
14/12/2019, 13:28 - Paul;: Ah
14/12/2019, 13:29 - Damian Rumble: The kind of PR they use in europe often has much larger constituencies, or regions, that you elect multiple people from a list of candidates provided by each party. Think of the system used for the EU elections
14/12/2019, 13:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah proportional representation would. But AV wouldn't
14/12/2019, 13:30 - Paul;: That would be fine. Just do that. Done. Next.
14/12/2019, 13:30 - Paul;: Can get a good blend of people in
14/12/2019, 13:31 - Paul;: A pick and mix of politicians
14/12/2019, 13:32 - Damian Rumble: It would be nice if we a system where enough people sign a petition, then it would force the government to hold an advisory referendum on an issue. It would allow people to express an opinion on an issue that the main political parties are never going to champion (like voting reform, legalising cannabis, etc)

18/12/2019, 12:50 - Stefan;: Lot of Labour people not getting that there are more options than just a repeat of Corbyn or Blair
18/12/2019, 12:52 - Jack G;: The problem is that there are multiple left leaning parties whereas the vast majority of the right leaning vote is concentrated on one party. Without taking some of those I don‚Äôt see how labour could get into power

18/12/2019, 13:52 - Damian Rumble: I heard the other day that there was a non aggression pact between labour and lib Dems in 1997 and it delivered a massive majority for labour and doubled the number of lib Dem seats. I think this needs to be the way to approach the 2024 election to avoid the splits in the left
18/12/2019, 14:02 - Hamish Sinclair: But now the lib dems are just yellow tories
18/12/2019, 14:05 - Jack G;: True. I still think they take much more potential labour votes than Tory. Difficult to quantify though

18/12/2019, 14:56 - Stefan;: Yeah but there's a lot more labour remainers than tory remainers, so the actual numbers the lib dems take are probably about equal
18/12/2019, 14:57 - Sam;: have you not fucked off to Singapore yet Damo?
18/12/2019, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: How the fraction is still small. I think this should put to bed the idea that the lib Dems are in anyway responsible for labour's humiliation.
18/12/2019, 15:00 - Jack G;: No. That‚Äôs down to momentum‚Äôs idiocy and Rupert Murdoch
18/12/2019, 15:01 - Rob;: I think that fact the lib dems did total shit removed that idea
18/12/2019, 15:01 - Stefan;: Agree with that, libdems could have helped labour win some seats but not enough to stop a tory majority, and labour never engaged in talks about a pact. Blair won 3 times with a much bigger libdem vote share
18/12/2019, 15:02 - Damian Rumble: Haha true
18/12/2019, 15:03 - Jack G;: I find it hilarious that Labour think the only way back is to elect a northern leader when they all just voted for Boris. A southern, Eton educated buffoon
18/12/2019, 16:30 - Paul;: Damo are you looking for a new party to support now?
18/12/2019, 21:32 - Paul;: https://youtu.be/rXjp8Eu1bXE
19/12/2019, 07:05 - Rob;: So Trump impeachment but will probably survive. What s cock tease
19/12/2019, 07:12 - Rob;: A real dry hump
19/12/2019, 07:22 - Jack G;: At least all the republican senators will have to go on record condoning his behaviour now
19/12/2019, 07:23 - Rob;: I think it will all just feed into his narrative of 'regular' guy attacked by the political establishment for tellin it like it is
19/12/2019, 08:01 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
19/12/2019, 08:01 - Rob;: Very throaty
19/12/2019, 08:02 - Jack G;: The cash in the jacket pocket
19/12/2019, 08:05 - Rob;: Lol yeah
19/12/2019, 08:05 - Rob;: The reviews of the Cats film are brilliant
19/12/2019, 08:05 - Rob;: Embargoed until release because the studio knew it was shit
19/12/2019, 08:06 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
19/12/2019, 08:06 - Rob;: My mate wasted a year of his life working on set for it
19/12/2019, 08:07 - Rob;: 'a computer-aided hellscape so off-putting you may suspect eye failure.'
19/12/2019, 08:07 - Rob;: 'Meanwhile, the Frankensteinian marriage of live performance, ‚Äúdigital fur technology‚Äù and human/cat anatomical splicing ‚Äì the boobs! they have boobs??!! ‚Äì has such endlessly sinister impact that the film's U certificate ought to be an 18.'
19/12/2019, 08:09 - Rob;: 'First contender Jennyandots is a lazy house tabby in the desperate, crotch-scratching shape of Rebel Wilson. Her big number has mice in a doll-house with human faces, and cockroaches in march formation, one of which she gobbles down in mad close-up. With its nightmare production design and nauseating lurches in scale and perspective, it might be the ugliest big-screen musical sequence ever mounted.'
19/12/2019, 08:25 - Paul;: It does look very shit
19/12/2019, 08:26 - Paul;: No one was asking for it
19/12/2019, 09:20 - Phill: <Media omitted>
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Rob;: I hadn't realised every single Independent Group MP lost their seat in the election
19/12/2019, 17:18 - Rob;: They had to inform everyone else
19/12/2019, 20:52 - Damian Rumble: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-50858811
19/12/2019, 20:56 - Sam;: Seriously Damian. This is not a politics shitposting sub reddit.
19/12/2019, 20:58 - Damian Rumble: Funny.... the number of times I thought that but replacing politics with football...
19/12/2019, 21:02 - Sam;: This is for football. In fact, if it could be only one thing. It would be  football
20/12/2019, 15:38 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
20/12/2019, 18:12 - Paul;: Rob, how come films can do review embargoes? What‚Äôs the punishment ?
20/12/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: Not being invited to an advance screening to another film by that studio again
20/12/2019, 18:39 - Paul;: But surely you wouldn‚Äôt want to be
20/12/2019, 18:39 - Rob;: So they're generally not broken, because for every Cats film there's a blockbuster / Oscar contender that publishers want to review
20/12/2019, 18:40 - Rob;: Cats is by Working Title
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Rob;: Who are owned by Universal
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Rob;: So that's like half the films you could get banned from
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Paul;: Is there big returns from publishing a review?
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Paul;: Kermode instantly out of work
20/12/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: Well not huge no, but generally embargoes at observed across every topic
20/12/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: No point needlessly breaking them for small gain
20/12/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: The fact that reviews get embargoed at all is usually a bad sign and tells people everything they need to know already
20/12/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: Has anyone embargoed a huge hit?
20/12/2019, 18:46 - Rob;: Marvel/Disney operate strict embargoes on films regardless of quality, to help generate extra anticipation among the fanbase who crave, above all else, just to know what happens
20/12/2019, 18:47 - Rob;: They are quite intense to deal with, getting images an copy approved to put out about Framestore films was pretty hard
20/12/2019, 18:48 - Rob;: But that's because they know people will see those films regardless of a good review
20/12/2019, 18:48 - Paul;: Cats hovering on 18% approval rating
20/12/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Non-franchise films that studios think are good get shown at film festivals months in advance of release to generate word of mouth hype
20/12/2019, 23:46 - Damian Rumble: Cats does look like utter tripe though

21/12/2019, 16:37 - Jack G;: Little goal for you then
21/12/2019, 16:38 - Rob;: A Christmas miracle

22/12/2019, 20:20 - / James Ball: Ah yeah. I just remember the long Damian sesh
23/12/2019, 08:23 - Rob;: This is one my favourite bit of Trump nonsense babbles https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1208881147867877377?s=19
23/12/2019, 08:25 - Rob;: "I never understood wind. I know windmills very much, I have studied it better than anybody. I know it is very expensive. They are made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here, almost none, but they are manufactured, tremendous - if you are into this - tremendous fumes and gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right?"

"So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right spewing, whether it is China or Germany, is going into the air."
23/12/2019, 08:25 - Rob;: "A windmill will kill many bald eagles. After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off, that is true. By the way, they make you turn it off. And yet, if you killed one, they put you in jail. That is OK. But why is it OK for windmills to destroy the bird population?"
23/12/2019, 09:17 - Damian Rumble: Lol. Realising that he is actually making the argument for climate change to a load of patriotic red necks, before Segwaying into a piece about killing bald eagles to win them back
23/12/2019, 09:19 - Rob;: Yeah, and that shit argument against wind turbines - that their creation creates co2 emmisions - as if power plants aren't built of concrete and metal too
23/12/2019, 09:21 - Rob;: Funny to hear it garbled up by trump's brain
23/12/2019, 09:30 - Paul;: Lol it says in the comments he got really against windmills due to his Scottish golf course and then building some offshore so it spoilt the view. Got a vendetta against them
23/12/2019, 16:04 - Paul;: Robbbbb they‚Äôve re cut cats already
23/12/2019, 16:06 - Rob;: Apparently they're resupplying it as they put it out without finishing the effects?
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: Forgot to make Judy Dench's hand a cat's
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: Not sure that will make it not terrible
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Paul;: Big move releasing the film before it‚Äôs done
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: I guess Christmas was their one chance to make their money back
23/12/2019, 16:10 - Paul;: They realised it would be complete shit anyway so just get it out there
23/12/2019, 16:10 - Paul;: ?
23/12/2019, 16:15 - Jack G;: Should have just cut it all together
23/12/2019, 16:16 - Jack G;: Altogether*
23/12/2019, 16:20 - Rob;: Well it's a sunk cost, you can't get the production money back, might as well screen it
23/12/2019, 16:21 - Rob;: Quite a lot of shit films end up making money because people are plebs
23/12/2019, 16:21 - Paul;: The chumscrubber
23/12/2019, 16:22 - Paul;: Weren‚Äôt a lot of films made as a tax dodge in the past? That‚Äôs why there‚Äôs so many that are complete shit
23/12/2019, 16:48 - Damian Rumble: Bold move going up against star wars with a piece of shit
24/12/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Damo, Paul, Ball Ball in for Chequers later?
24/12/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Jack and Stefan too?
24/12/2019, 12:24 - Paul;: Potentially
24/12/2019, 12:28 - Stefan;: Yep, just let me know when
24/12/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: Usually an early-ish kick off. I said 7:30 to Verity
24/12/2019, 12:32 - Rob;: Jaaacccckkkk
24/12/2019, 12:59 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm I no in Chippy

24/12/2019, 18:41 - / James Ball: 0 in my case
24/12/2019, 18:42 - / James Ball: I'm probably going to have some food first then come out. Probably a bit after 7:30
24/12/2019, 19:24 - Paul;: I‚Äôm here
24/12/2019, 19:25 - Rob;: On my way
24/12/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Be there now
24/12/2019, 20:13 - / James Ball: En route now

25/12/2019, 11:00 - Paul;: Rob please can you draw the colon thing as a Christmas gift to all
25/12/2019, 11:14 - / James Ball: My brother's colon?
25/12/2019, 11:15 - Paul;: No it‚Äôs this new concept I‚Äôve been working on
25/12/2019, 11:24 - Sam;: Good to get a little time lapse on the regrowth
25/12/2019, 12:21 - David;: The toe review

25/12/2019, 12:23 - David;: Was going to make this my card this year
25/12/2019, 12:48 - Paul;: Raaaabbbbbbb
25/12/2019, 12:50 - / James Ball: The snowflake and snowman really make this
25/12/2019, 12:50 - / James Ball: Very Microsoft Word 2003
25/12/2019, 12:50 - Paul;: Microsoft publisher
25/12/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Needs more word art
25/12/2019, 13:50 - Damian Rumble: These toes have really made my Xmas....
25/12/2019, 14:02 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
25/12/2019, 14:08 - / James Ball: Ah yes, the long colon
25/12/2019, 14:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Is this just a colon like tail?
25/12/2019, 14:11 - Paul;: Yes but that means you can direct it. It also sucks back up inside when not in use. The blue thing is the colon hook that everyone has so they don‚Äôt have to touch bare colon
25/12/2019, 14:12 - Paul;: As it‚Äôs a veiny slimy stinking mess
25/12/2019, 14:13 - Hamish Sinclair: What evolutionary advantage are we getting from this?
25/12/2019, 14:13 - Paul;: The colon hook is like one of those snake handling sticks
25/12/2019, 14:14 - Paul;: You can shit on the go. Direct it almost discretely into a plant pot etc
25/12/2019, 14:14 - Paul;: Shit standing up etc. Show me a disadvantage
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Should just have it built into a tail
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: So it has a skin/furry outer layer
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Paul;: Yeah but this colon does retract when no in use
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Ahh
25/12/2019, 14:16 - / James Ball: Retractable veiny colon
25/12/2019, 14:16 - / James Ball: A whole industry is colon care products springs up
25/12/2019, 14:16 - Paul;: But we need rob to draw it
25/12/2019, 14:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Raaaaab
25/12/2019, 14:17 - Hamish Sinclair: I love the idea of verity meeting you all for "xmas drinks" and she actually gets 4 hours of extendable colon
25/12/2019, 14:18 - Paul;: We kept that very quiet. Can‚Äôt unleash the colon talk in public
25/12/2019, 14:18 - Paul;: The masses aren‚Äôt ready for it
25/12/2019, 14:24 - Paul;: Raaaabbbbb
25/12/2019, 14:29 - David;: Is it like an elephants trunk but shit comes out rather than water going in
25/12/2019, 14:30 - David;: Has the chequers dealt with the mushroom infestation?
25/12/2019, 14:31 - Paul;: Yeah they did a ¬£1m renovation
25/12/2019, 14:31 - Paul;: Mushrooms vanquished with a milly
25/12/2019, 15:39 - Paul;: Raaaabbbb
25/12/2019, 16:13 - Phill: Where do we store the shitty colon hook? Seems like the convenience of shitting into plant pots is offset by carrying around a rotting, shitty baton
25/12/2019, 16:14 - Paul;: Telescopic isn‚Äôt it easy to store
25/12/2019, 16:15 - Phill: Still need somewhere to keep it. Don't want it in my pocket mingling with my wallet or phone. "Can I borrow your phone?" "Sure, excuse the mucus"
25/12/2019, 16:15 - Paul;: Has a carry case
25/12/2019, 16:15 - Phill: Nah.
25/12/2019, 16:19 - Phill: What stops the case getting shitty?
25/12/2019, 16:20 - Paul;: Shitty on the inside so not a problem
25/12/2019, 16:20 - Phill: There are holes on this theory.
25/12/2019, 16:21 - Phill: My grans colostomy bag honks so everyone just be walking round reeking of shit
25/12/2019, 16:34 - Paul;: Yeah there‚Äôs a huge market in masking scents and perfumes that‚Äôs sprang up
25/12/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: I would have thought it only reeks as much as a normal arse
25/12/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: Just a longer colon you can fondle
25/12/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: I'm not going to be taking time out from family Christmas day to draw it, but I wish it all the best
25/12/2019, 16:37 - Rob;: I'll illustrate sometime in the Christmas break
25/12/2019, 17:10 - Phill: Nah. As soon as shit is outside of the body for an extended period of time it takes on another level of stench.
25/12/2019, 17:13 - / James Ball: It will just see through the sack
25/12/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: But teh trunk is the body
25/12/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: It's like how your cock doesn't feel of piss and cum
25/12/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: *reek
25/12/2019, 17:21 - Paul;: Lol
25/12/2019, 17:23 - Paul;: The trunk
25/12/2019, 17:31 - / James Ball: Colonic trunk socks
25/12/2019, 17:31 - / James Ball: Aerated colon trousers
25/12/2019, 17:48 - David;: 4 types of meat on a plate
25/12/2019, 17:48 - David;: Very gouty
25/12/2019, 17:52 - Phill: I'm not talking about the trunk reeking, just the shitty hook you carry around
25/12/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: Ah yeah. I'm not sure about the hook. Paul you'll need to sell that too me
25/12/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: I would just keep my trunk clean and hold it slightly away from the orifice
25/12/2019, 17:55 - Paul;: I don‚Äôt know why the hook has so much opposition. It never touches any shit. The outer skin of the trunk does no have shit on it. That would be found inside the colonic trunk
25/12/2019, 17:56 - Paul;: It‚Äôs just unsightly. A tough skin covered in veins and lumps
25/12/2019, 18:03 - / James Ball: Just make it prehensile
25/12/2019, 18:06 - Rob;: Lol, so you can point and shoot hands-free
25/12/2019, 18:17 - David;: Need to know more about the muscle control you have over the shit trunk
25/12/2019, 18:17 - David;: If it's as dextrous as a tail then the hook seems defunct
25/12/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: I'm seeing it as a very thick limp cock
25/12/2019, 18:21 - Paul;: Could be very accurate
25/12/2019, 18:23 - Phill: Don't need a hook for my cock. Don't need one for my shit trunk.
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: Lol
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: What about a sling for the shit trunk
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: Like the ones you carry babies in
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: But it‚Äôs carrying your reeking shit trunk
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Phill: Does the trunk ooze a mucus pre shit?
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Phill: Like pre-cum?
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Phill: Pre-shit?
25/12/2019, 19:30 - / James Ball: Everyone going around leaving a snail like mucus trail

28/12/2019, 15:03 - David;: Also considered having a tail on the other side of the wall so looks as if he's stuck in the fabric of the house
28/12/2019, 15:03 - David;: Nah just been made by an illustrator friend they have
28/12/2019, 15:03 - David;: But I'm imagining it as a proper death mask

30/12/2019, 11:57 - Damian Rumble: "WE‚ÄôRE ALL GOING ON A CLASSY RURAL SESH" [Sounds very familiar]
AirBnBs are fast becoming the new nightclubs. Nobody wants to go out and get fucked any more. They want to book cottages in seaside towns, go on nice long walks, ruin cosy pubs for the locals and then get fucked. So, some of your mates have found some ten person mansion in the Hebrides and they are going to take a bunch of MDMA and laugh at sheep for a couple of days. Probably your well-off media mates, to be honest: nice opportunity for them to lock themselves in a cottage with a bucket of gear and chew each other‚Äôs ears off about search-engine optimisation and the state of online content.

31/12/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
31/12/2019, 22:17 - David;: Early on New Year's morning, householders drink and then sprinkle 'magic water' from 'a dead and living ford' around the house (a 'dead and living ford' refers to a river ford that is routinely crossed by both the living and the dead). After the sprinkling of the water in every room, on the beds and all the inhabitants, the house is sealed up tight and branches of juniper are set on fire and carried throughout the house and byre. The juniper smoke is allowed to thoroughly fumigate the buildings until it causes sneezing and coughing among the inhabitants. Then all the doors and windows are flung open to let in the cold, fresh air of the new year. The woman of the house then administers 'a restorative' from the whisky bottle, and the household sits down to its New Year breakfast
31/12/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: 20 years on from the millennium bug
31/12/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: Still waiting
31/12/2019, 22:54 - Rob;: It isn't in the mirror, it isn't on the page
It's a red hearted vibration
Pushing through the walls of dark imagination
Finding no equation
There's a red road rage,
But it's not road rage
It's asylum seekers engulfed by a grudge

Scottish friction, Scottish friction
It isn't in the castle, it isn't in the mist
It's a calling of the waters as they break to show
The new black death with reactors aglow
Do you think your security can keep you in purity
You will not shake us off
Above or below

01/01/2020, 02:37 - Rob;: I tried to imply that the deep V belonged to the gays, unwankishly, not that gays in general were a trend of the 2010s. But that's autocorrect for you

03/01/2020, 08:56 - Hamish Sinclair: A very lib dem outlook
03/01/2020, 08:57 - Hamish Sinclair: On a serious note, you should probably apply
03/01/2020, 08:57 - Damian Rumble: G. Super-talented weirdos

People in SW1 talk a lot about ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô but they rarely mean ‚Äòtrue cognitive diversity‚Äô. They are usually babbling about ‚Äògender identity diversity blah blah‚Äô. What SW1 needs is not more drivel about ‚Äòidentity‚Äô and ‚Äòdiversity‚Äô from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.

We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole, weirdos from William Gibson novels like that girl hired by Bigend as a brand ‚Äòdiviner‚Äô who feels sick at the sight of Tommy Hilfiger or that Chinese-Cuban free runner from a crime family hired by the KGB. If you want to figure out what characters around Putin might do, or how international criminal gangs might exploit holes in our border security, you don‚Äôt want more Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread fake news about fake news.
03/01/2020, 08:58 - Damian Rumble: Send a max 1 page letter plus CV to ideasfornumber10@gmail.com and put in the subject line ‚Äòjob/‚Äô and add after the / one of: data, developer, econ, comms, projects, research, policy, misfit.

I‚Äôll have to spend time helping you so don‚Äôt apply unless you can commit to at least 2 years.

I‚Äôll bin you within weeks if you don‚Äôt fit ‚Äî don‚Äôt complain later because I made it clear now.
03/01/2020, 09:01 - Damian Rumble: "dear Mr Cummings, I'd love to use my skills as a data scientist to push through a digital revolution in Whitehall. Unfortunately you are a massive cunt and I would prefer to punch you in the face. I would love it if you could consider me for interview. Thank you. "
03/01/2020, 09:02 - Hamish Sinclair: That would probably get you in

06/01/2020, 22:02 - Phill: Best idea is one called "penny on the pound"
06/01/2020, 22:04 - Phill: Where all the people who say "I'd pay a bit more tax for that" donate an extra penny on their pounds of earnings for that year and it goes into one big fund and large sums are donated to things like mental health charities, cancer research, social care initiatives etc etc

07/01/2020, 17:14 - Rob;: Yeah, going from spectator to focus
07/01/2020, 17:14 - David;: Lol live burial. It's an actual interment - 'i just came for some low-fi techno!'
07/01/2020, 17:14 - David;: I did think the tickets were cheap
07/01/2020, 17:15 - Rob;: Damo, Did you turn up in Iran for Burial (live)?
07/01/2020, 17:15 - David;: So it's actually burying someone alive
07/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Has to be ticked for crowd control reasons
07/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Too popular
07/01/2020, 17:17 - Rob;: *ticketed

07/01/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: Well those were some really excited and deranged street preachers. Not what I expected at all
07/01/2020, 17:22 - David;: Block party - something you might actually get tickets for
07/01/2020, 17:22 - Rob;: Everyone kept going on about this band. Just four insects. Awful.
07/01/2020, 17:28 - David;: I wanted to see four tet but was actually a quartet.
07/01/2020, 17:29 - David;: It did surprise me that the venue was the royal Albert hall
07/01/2020, 18:39 - Damian Rumble: I had seen it on 'bandsintown' but this time thought better of it

08/01/2020, 12:23 - Damian Rumble: It's not even on the coast...
08/01/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: Yeah, yeah, just an eccentric vertical extension
08/01/2020, 12:31 - Rob;: 5 miles inland
08/01/2020, 12:32 - Phill: That is grotesque.
08/01/2020, 12:41 - Paul;: What is a windmill
08/01/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: I know the tower came first you nonce
08/01/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: But they've managed to make it look the other way around with the extension

08/01/2020, 13:18 - Sam;: a horrible growth.

08/01/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Says it‚Äôs Megan‚Äôs influence. Asked if they‚Äôd be ‚Äòstepping back‚Äô from their financial allowance from the privy purse as well..
08/01/2020, 20:59 - Rob;: That is part of the statement - looking to go financially independent
08/01/2020, 21:00 - Sam;: Ah. Well I shall let her know then lol
08/01/2020, 21:02 - David;: But that must all be part of a deeper plan?
08/01/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Still. Their 6 week holiday in Canada was on our dime.
08/01/2020, 21:03 - David;: She is peeling him away from the UK slowly though, does she take issue with that? 'Splitting their time between the united kingdom and north america'
08/01/2020, 21:06 - Sam;: Only a few comments released at this time, full interview to follow tomorrow
09/01/2020, 12:49 - David;: Anyone else seen the grammarly adverts on youtube? The woman in them is the most punchable person that exists.

09/01/2020, 12:59 - David;: Not so much the face though, it's the hateful patronising tone
09/01/2020, 12:59 - David;: Must have been bobarded with this? 'If you write anything on your computer, you need the get grammarly'.
09/01/2020, 13:02 - Jack G;: >need the get
09/01/2020, 13:03 - Rob;: Beach no paid
09/01/2020, 13:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Very Hermione grainger
09/01/2020, 15:02 - David;: Jesus, Hamish you are 6,000 globally in FF at the moment
09/01/2020, 15:03 - David;: On the sly. Pretty competitive league this year.
09/01/2020, 15:06 - Rob;: Hamish is actually closer to being number 1 than Dave, Paul and Jack are to being above Hamish
09/01/2020, 15:07 - Rob;: And it's a fairly tight year
09/01/2020, 15:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, annoyed to have been knocked out the cup in the 2nd round
09/01/2020, 15:20 - Jack G;: I didn‚Äôt even qualify for the cup
09/01/2020, 15:21 - Jack G;: Only top 4 million get in apparently, first time that‚Äôs ever happened to me
09/01/2020, 15:23 - David;: It's the West Ham way
09/01/2020, 15:26 - David;: I'm still in the top 10% overall but way off Hamish.
09/01/2020, 15:35 - Hamish Sinclair: The shame
09/01/2020, 15:35 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs bizarre though because I‚Äôm now 2.3 millionth 2 weeks after I was 6 millionth
09/01/2020, 15:36 - David;: Late title challenge?
09/01/2020, 15:37 - Jack G;: Nah, would need a miracle triple captain to even have a chance
09/01/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: At some point the triple captain on a double game week will come off for one of us
09/01/2020, 15:38 - Rob;: Ever since they've introduced it either Kane, Aguero or Salah has either played only one game or done shit in the double game week everyone triple captained them
09/01/2020, 15:39 - David;: You could theoretically get a c.100 point swing from it if your opponent picks a player that does nothing or gets injured on the first game and the player you pick has 4-5 goals and all the bonus points
09/01/2020, 15:39 - David;: just quite unlikely
09/01/2020, 15:40 - David;: Mostly it would ironically work out better to TC them on a single game week where they actually do something
09/01/2020, 15:41 - Jack G;: I got mocked for doing that last season
09/01/2020, 15:41 - Rob;: I think Trent might have the best score across two games so far this season - 32 across GW 19 and 20, could have been worth 98 points if it had fallen as a double game week
09/01/2020, 15:41 - Rob;: Yeah, I think the chance of key player seeing rested in double game weeks makes it horrendously risky
09/01/2020, 15:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Did it come off tho?
09/01/2020, 15:42 - Rob;: Going for defenders who often score/assist who have two good fixtures seems like a less risky bet
09/01/2020, 15:42 - Jack G;: No it was a waste as usual
09/01/2020, 15:43 - David;: I had a troll TC where Aguero scored 2 and then took a penalty for the hat-trick but missed it. That miss was like an 18 point swing in one kick of the ball
09/01/2020, 15:44 - David;: because the points taken off also trebled
09/01/2020, 15:44 - Rob;: I would love to see someone's triple captain sent off in the aftermath of missing a penalty in the first of a double game week before the 60th minute
09/01/2020, 15:44 - Rob;: A yellow and a subsequent straight red
09/01/2020, 15:45 - David;: Having conceded 4 goals as a defender
09/01/2020, 15:46 - Rob;: All of which were own goals they scored
09/01/2020, 15:47 - Rob;: That would be -39 net
09/01/2020, 15:47 - Jack G;: The classic penalty taking defender. Your Leighton Baines
09/01/2020, 15:47 - Rob;: So if that happened to Hamish and Jack had a 100 PT triple captain, Jack would go top
09/01/2020, 15:48 - Rob;: -45 actually
09/01/2020, 15:49 - Rob;: Actually, no it wouldn't, you're 222 behind. Jack, you're fucked
09/01/2020, 15:49 - Jack G;: What about if I get a lucky bench boost as well, and additional 50 or something
09/01/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: Yeah, in another week, if say none of hamish's bench played when he boosted his and yours all scored hattricks
09/01/2020, 15:53 - Jack G;: Don‚Äôt forget it‚Äôs not just Hamish I‚Äôm trying to overhaul. Everyone else has to be shite too
09/01/2020, 15:53 - David;: The classic hat-trick of hatr-tricks from the bench
09/01/2020, 15:55 - David;: You do have more than 16 gameweeks left though. Just need to make 150 up in the TC catastrophe plus 5 every other week
09/01/2020, 15:55 - David;: *16 more
09/01/2020, 15:57 - David;: Haller suddenly coming into form? Bet heavily on the Moyes rennaissance, put everything on that I say
09/01/2020, 15:59 - Jack G;: That is not the way

15/01/2020, 08:03 - Rob;: I swear all the Brexiteer's actually wanted was a bit of pomp and ceremony. We could have just pretended to leave, got the queen to eat a pasty as she stamps on a croissant and cuts an enormous 7 and 3/4 mile Union Jack ribbon that's been draped over the cliffs of Dover with some big UK scissors and shouts BRITAIN IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS, while we all stand watching with our feat in the blessed British sea collectively wanking into  commemorative VHS tape boxes of Carry on Follow that Arab and munching our celebratory bendy British bananas as the British Empire strikes back.

19/01/2020, 09:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Technically it would be like man city being relegated because they are the actual premier league champions and they actually have breached financial fair play

22/01/2020, 15:51 - Jack G;: Just a larger packet of crisps, done
22/01/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: Easy cook rice takes longer to cook than normal rice
22/01/2020, 15:51 - David;: I think the idea is you consider them such good value you have to grab hold of them the instant you see them
22/01/2020, 15:52 - David;: As if grab bags are in permanent danger of selling out
22/01/2020, 15:56 - Rob;: This dress comes in petite, medium and grab bag
22/01/2020, 15:59 - David;: I always read it as an imperative: 'grab bag!'
22/01/2020, 16:00 - David;: grab that bag you filthy crisp hound
22/01/2020, 16:01 - Rob;: Maybe that's why it's become the norm. It's making a lot of people grab a lot of crisps
22/01/2020, 16:02 - Rob;: Maybe 'big' was trialled, but it made people feel bad for eating loads of crisps
22/01/2020, 16:03 - Rob;: Glasses can be half-full or half-empty depending on your outlook, but bags of crisps are ALWAYS half-empty
22/01/2020, 16:05 - David;: I feel worse for grabbing the crisps
22/01/2020, 16:05 - David;: 'Value Bag'? Who doesn't like value
22/01/2020, 16:06 - David;: then you're just being prudent, not a greedy fat fuck.
22/01/2020, 16:52 - Damian Rumble: >NikNaks
22/01/2020, 16:53 - David;: Explain yourself you cretin
22/01/2020, 16:56 - Damian Rumble: Shit in the 90s. Shit now. Don't even count them as crisps. Just fluff packed with e numbers
22/01/2020, 16:58 - Rob;: NikNaks might say the same about you
22/01/2020, 17:02 - David;: Lol yeah that is Damo, fluff packed with e numbers wrapped in the financial times
22/01/2020, 17:02 - David;: I mean clearly the best baked crisp and baked crisps are clearly the superior crisp. Next.
22/01/2020, 17:02 - Rob;: Shit in the 90s. Shit now.
22/01/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: I have a lot time for Chip Sticks
22/01/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: That cheap shitty indulgence
22/01/2020, 17:03 - David;: No one has ever said that
22/01/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: The searing vinegar assault to the gullet
22/01/2020, 17:04 - David;: the only thing I like about them is that it's just possible to swallow them whole and it scours out your entire esophgus
22/01/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
22/01/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: Bit plus point for me too
22/01/2020, 17:04 - David;: Like a scouring brush for your own gullet
22/01/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: Pickled onion monster munch are excellent
22/01/2020, 17:05 - Rob;: I'm just naming crisps here
22/01/2020, 17:05 - David;: Ah but the huge danger they pose to the roof of your mouth
22/01/2020, 17:05 - David;: That can ruin everything
22/01/2020, 17:06 - David;: Too sharp
22/01/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: I use my teeth to break them down before they get there
22/01/2020, 17:06 - David;: It seems you go for a very sharp crisp experience
22/01/2020, 17:06 - David;: I'm a fan of beef space raiders
22/01/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: Yeah, fine
22/01/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: Don't see them a lot. Not metropolitan or elite enough (like Chip Sticks)
22/01/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: Skips. The melting. A really excellent experience
22/01/2020, 17:08 - David;: You find them a lot more in Scotland
22/01/2020, 17:09 - David;: Scotland is very retro with it's crisp selections
22/01/2020, 17:10 - David;: I rate it a lot it's dodged all these new posh fried brands - your Burt's etc.
22/01/2020, 17:11 - David;: I basically think crisp technology peaked in 1995 and it's been downhill since
22/01/2020, 17:15 - Rob;: I don't like kettle chips and overly posh brands
22/01/2020, 17:16 - Jack G;: But walkers max paprika Dave, invented in 1999
22/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: It's an obviously cheap and cheerful foodstuff and you can't hide that
22/01/2020, 17:16 - David;: Yeah same classic mistake people think they are better because of the adult branding
22/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Beyond the heaven that is Walkers Sensations Thai Sweet Chilli
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: I will admit them plus Synders pretzels. That's all
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: No
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: Weird chemical taste
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: Very cloying
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: Ah yeah, just gumping a huge handful of TSC and swigging a load of Coca-Cola
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: 1/10 at best
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: Find with the weird chemical taste
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: Again a 1/10
22/01/2020, 17:19 - Jack G;: Walkers max definitely the most common in the wall of empty crisp packets in the metal grating at Chippy school
22/01/2020, 17:20 - David;: Max paprika only a lunch crisp though, you can't have them in the evening
22/01/2020, 17:20 - Rob;: Lol
22/01/2020, 17:20 - David;: Hula hoop beef under-rated. Easy to forget about hula hoops
22/01/2020, 17:20 - Rob;: I had never thought of categorising some as Evening Crisps
22/01/2020, 17:21 - David;: Yeah, like you'd only have sensations in the evening that's not a meal deal option
22/01/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: The joy of having a hula hoop on each finger tip ready to go is real
22/01/2020, 17:21 - David;: Vice versa with the max
22/01/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: What's your crisps per week rate atm Dave?
22/01/2020, 17:22 - David;: Try not to eat mid-week but have the odd packet with lunch when hungry. Mainly do my crisp guzzling at the weekends.
22/01/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: It's really slipped for me. Never been a huge snacker, more driven by frousts or being at home, where my mum still buys crisps as if she has teenage children, than anything else.
22/01/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: Not had any crisps this decade so far
22/01/2020, 17:26 - Jack G;: Nah
22/01/2020, 17:26 - David;: That's no life
22/01/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: Lol
22/01/2020, 17:27 - David;: The crisp is a national delicacy, we've elevated it  to a standard the world envies
22/01/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: Shittest crisp?
22/01/2020, 18:06 - Jack G;: Got to be twiglets
22/01/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: That‚Äôs mental. Twiglets are excellent
22/01/2020, 18:07 - Jack G;: Nah they‚Äôre awful
22/01/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: Although you are a person who chomps down coriander willingly so not unexpected you‚Äôd have poor taste
22/01/2020, 18:08 - Phill: Cheese and onion walkers
22/01/2020, 18:10 - Paul;: McCoy‚Äôs Thai sweet chilli - terrible. Crisps should have nothing sweet near them
22/01/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Mcoys sweet chilli chicken fucking GOAT tier
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: Wrong. Trash.
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Jack G;: Next
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: Put shit in bin
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Phill: Stay mad autist
22/01/2020, 18:15 - Jack G;: Bugles definitely top tier
22/01/2020, 18:24 - David;: Plain salted McCoys are always a dissapointment
22/01/2020, 18:25 - David;: McCoys chedder and onion used to be the best of all crisps until they changed the flavour a few years back now average
22/01/2020, 18:35 - Phill: Ready salted french fries are actually the shittest of them all
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Rob;: Anything that's black pepper is shit
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Rob;: In it for the salt, not blunt tongue tingle
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Phill: Agreed, black pepper is shite.
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: Salt and shake. Great plain crisp concept. Do rare
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: *rate
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Rob;: Yeah, do rate
22/01/2020, 18:37 - Rob;: I would like a mini chip chop vinegar bottle in there too
22/01/2020, 18:37 - Phill: Heavy, synthetic cheese based crisps are trash
22/01/2020, 18:37 - Phill: The ones that stain your hands with stinky shit
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Paul;: >Caramelised onion and cheese
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Paul;: >rosemary and thyme
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Phill: >prosecco
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Phill: >gin and tonic
22/01/2020, 19:07 - David;: Agreed, wotsits terrible for that reason
22/01/2020, 19:08 - Rob;: Yeah, wotsits are just packing foam for masochists
22/01/2020, 19:20 - Damian Rumble: One of the best things about being an adult is not have having to ever comprehend eating garbage like Nik naks, space invaders, wotsits, monster munch, skips. All of those contain enough chemicals they are bound to give you a cancer tumour, which is ironic because that is exactly what they look like.
22/01/2020, 19:20 - Rob;: How times change. You only used to eat yellow.
22/01/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Damo what used to be your diet?

22/01/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: Jack I'm hoping West Ham can contribute to the highest scoring game week ever exclusively by getting thrashed twice
22/01/2020, 19:40 - David;: Ah amazing. Will be watching
22/01/2020, 19:49 - David;: The ultimate froust viewing double bill would be this followed by the Theroux saville doc
22/01/2020, 19:49 - Paul;: Warnock has a big saville moment at the beginning
22/01/2020, 19:50 - Paul;: 2min 40 seconds in

22/01/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: Ruining the rhyme of _name's_ with _James_
22/01/2020, 21:49 - Paul;: Isn‚Äôt name is the genius of it as it rhymes with the pronunciation of James
22/01/2020, 21:50 - Hamish Sinclair: The whole thing is genius
22/01/2020, 21:51 - David;: Lol nah
22/01/2020, 21:51 - David;: That's baffling
22/01/2020, 21:51 - David;: Why include Rodriguez?
22/01/2020, 21:52 - Paul;: Named after James Bond
22/01/2020, 21:52 - Paul;: Next.
22/01/2020, 21:52 - David;: Also this was when he was playing with James on his back not Rodriguez
22/01/2020, 21:53 - David;: So would make sense without it. But no put that in

23/01/2020, 20:45 - Paul;: Dave appears to be in a more season ruined spot
23/01/2020, 20:51 - Jack G;: Best just to never use the triple captain at all, always seems to attract failure
23/01/2020, 20:53 - Rob;: Yeah. It's just a troll machine

29/01/2020, 16:56 - Rob;: Who's wall was it?
29/01/2020, 17:38 - David;: In that pub that is all the pubs
29/01/2020, 17:39 - David;: To the left is the door to the toilet. So he'd made it that far but no don't need to worry about that.

29/01/2020, 18:05 - Sam;: There‚Äôs no proof linking me to the picture. The eye witness testimony is from a man who had been DRINKING. My lawyer would rip that to shreds in court.
29/01/2020, 18:16 - Jack G;: Only a guilty party would put together such a strong denial
29/01/2020, 18:26 - Sam;: I demand justice after these wild accusations ‚ÄòJack‚Äô.

29/01/2020, 21:18 - Rob;: Happens to so many players you'd think the reverse would work more often - your Titus Brambles going to Serie A and tearing it up
29/01/2020, 21:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, turns up in italy and they cant believe how quick he plays
29/01/2020, 21:19 - Rob;: Iago Aspas one example perhaps?

01/02/2020, 08:57 - Rob;: Sorry
01/02/2020, 08:57 - Rob;: Or he's some hairy fat man born with one cock and one vagina but not balls?
01/02/2020, 08:58 - Rob;: And no one thought to mention it now
01/02/2020, 08:58 - Phill: If he did have a vagina, I'd be asking why he didn't just rape himself?
01/02/2020, 08:59 - David;: Yep, it seems like a bollockless cock over a scarred disfigured minge
01/02/2020, 09:00 - Rob;: Perhaps all this time when people thought he was sleazily saying how much he was into sex, he was actually trying to reveal he was intersex? Everyone mishearing him for decades turned him into the groper we know and love

01/02/2020, 16:48 - Jack G;: Bullshit, it‚Äôs like the refs want us relegated
01/02/2020, 16:57 - Hamish Sinclair: I hear the refs are also conspiring to win liverpool the league?
01/02/2020, 17:00 - Jack G;: Who‚Äôs saying that? Not heard it from anyone, especially considering the 18 point gap. Must be Liverpool fans missing being the butthurt underdog

02/02/2020, 12:09 - Rob;: Yeah, this and the triple captain last week has changed everything
02/02/2020, 12:10 - Phill: Hamish also thinks Salah is dog shit so is protesting by not having him. Very much like Dave not hopping on the pukki bandwagon
02/02/2020, 12:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, the decision to hold onto mane and not salah looks pretty shit in hindoght

02/02/2020, 12:51 - Phill: But the points Dave, the points.
02/02/2020, 12:59 - David;: But the lack of points for weeks
02/02/2020, 13:00 - David;: The lack of points
02/02/2020, 13:01 - David;: My new bug bear is De Bruyne, refuse to own him
02/02/2020, 13:31 - Phill: But buy low sell high. Ride the wagon. No one's stopping you getting off.
02/02/2020, 13:45 - David;: That's assuming you exactly judge the end of the wagon though. Usually it's unclear if the wagon has really stopped or just gone over a bump.
02/02/2020, 14:10 - Damian Rumble: Salah has been miss firing all season. Never could have foreseen that he could start scoring goals again
02/02/2020, 14:13 - Jack G;: Man known for scoring goals scores goals
02/02/2020, 14:13 - Jack G;: Gary goals
02/02/2020, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, not having mane in the team also makes more of our play go though him

05/02/2020, 21:38 - Sam;: He‚Äôs done well then. I wouldn‚Äôt discarded trousers and shoes before the journey but at least he doesn‚Äôt have to put them in his own bin

07/02/2020, 10:09 - Jack G;: Sancho tearing Bundesliga apart as well, got a lot of time for this Dortmund team
07/02/2020, 10:20 - David;: Shame Sterling has turned shit and Kane injured
07/02/2020, 11:34 - Phill: Work today - from a harness. Absailing. Shart in my pants.
07/02/2020, 11:35 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/02/2020, 11:36 - Rob;: The view from the shart
07/02/2020, 13:07 - Stefan;: Absolutely fuck this 100%

07/02/2020, 13:10 - Phill: How about this one Stefan? From the parapet?
07/02/2020, 13:10 - Sam;: Can you piss? Good to get on the news as the Wembley pisser
07/02/2020, 13:11 - Sam;: Showering everything below
07/02/2020, 13:11 - Phill: I'm back at ground level now

07/02/2020, 18:29 - Rob;: Yeah
07/02/2020, 18:30 - Rob;: To be honest I would actually like to be quarantined with FM. Like a sober alcoholic, I've never lost the urge for one more sip of it

08/02/2020, 10:24 - / James Ball: Another find on my browsing the internet was an office that kept a list of one particular guy's various claims he's made over the years
08/02/2020, 10:26 - / James Ball: - Once jumped out of a chinook helicopter into the North Sea

- Was the first person in the UK to buy a playstation3

08/02/2020, 10:27 - / James Ball: - Installed Robbie Fowler's bathroom
08/02/2020, 10:30 - / James Ball: - Was once on a job installing radiators when the customer had to leave unexpectedly. With one radiator left to install the customer left him with the instruction not to enter a specified room. When the customer left, he entered said room and thereupon found a live, fully grown tiger lying on the couch.
08/02/2020, 10:43 - David;: Yeah yeah I'm only ever one installation away from a relapse. I could never allow myself 'just one season'

08/02/2020, 17:15 - David;: Nah
08/02/2020, 17:15 - David;: That can't just be a single lager doing that
08/02/2020, 17:36 - Phill: It was the volume of food.
08/02/2020, 17:36 - Phill: Followed by a quick lager
08/02/2020, 17:36 - Phill: Which killed me.
08/02/2020, 17:36 - Phill: Full ancient Greek on town. The vomitarium
08/02/2020, 18:20 - David;: Sambo can you give me some context on Wilder fury 2?
08/02/2020, 18:25 - Sam;: Huge rematch. Heavy weight belt on the line. I cannot fucking wait
08/02/2020, 18:31 - David;: So it's not small?
08/02/2020, 18:31 - David;: There's scope?
08/02/2020, 18:32 - David;: Who won the first?
08/02/2020, 18:32 - Sam;: Controversial draw as many thought the points decision shouldn‚Äôt gone to Fury
08/02/2020, 18:37 - David;: Is Joshua over now?
08/02/2020, 18:38 - David;: Losing to the little fat bloke. Hard to come back from
08/02/2020, 18:50 - Sam;: Nah, he‚Äôs working his way back, beat the little fella to win back the belts so he back to be the man to beat. The winner of wilder fury will likely fight Joshua to see who becomes the undisputed heavy weight champion of the world (holds all heavyweight belts)
08/02/2020, 19:09 - David;: But the little fat fella
08/02/2020, 19:09 - David;: That's a real stain on the record

09/02/2020, 16:19 - Jack G;: Don‚Äôt spill the beans
09/02/2020, 16:20 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs a no brainer though. Obviously salah will be scoring a hat trick against Norwich
09/02/2020, 17:09 - Damian Rumble: It's the winter break period right? They can easily reschedule the match for next weekend and it still be part of the same game week
09/02/2020, 18:18 - Jack G;: No idea why everyone keeps going on about this ‚Äúwinter break‚Äù
09/02/2020, 18:18 - Jack G;: 4 games this weekend? There are games next weekend too...

09/02/2020, 19:26 - David;: But no teams playing both so everyone gets at least 2 full weeks between games
09/02/2020, 19:26 - David;: They've staggered it
09/02/2020, 19:33 - Jack G;: Hardly a break though. A proper winter break we‚Äôre talking 3 weeks off for all teams.
09/02/2020, 20:32 - Damian Rumble: Rachel Pearson married Stuart Kench today. Wrap your noging around that one....

09/02/2020, 20:36 - David;: Going for a piss you could be swept off the mountain

12/02/2020, 19:37 - David;: Super Grass - a demonstration of new 4g pitch technology actually?

12/02/2020, 20:39 - Rob;: Yeah
12/02/2020, 20:39 - David;: Went to field day there the line up was great but sound quality ruined a lot of it
12/02/2020, 20:39 - David;: Four tet, beach house etc.
12/02/2020, 20:41 - Rob;: Those APE gigs have a really horrible vibe where it feels like it's been planned according to what Alan Sugar thinks Glastonbury might be like
12/02/2020, 20:41 - David;: Yes
12/02/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: The money man's idea of what the kids are into
12/02/2020, 20:42 - David;: Exactly the same with field day
12/02/2020, 20:42 - David;: Good description
12/02/2020, 20:42 - David;: Very artificial corporate vibe. A lot of board meetings and market research have happened
12/02/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: Worth going to if you live the band, but you've got to get in the right bit of the crowd to enjoy it
12/02/2020, 20:43 - David;: Generally urban festivals not a fan.
12/02/2020, 20:43 - Rob;: 'what will look like people are having fun in pictures'
12/02/2020, 20:44 - Rob;: Yeah, it doesn't work. Cities have great gig venues that work brilliantly. The countryside has fields.

13/02/2020, 16:59 - Damian Rumble: A very underwhelming reshuffle. Really hoping to see the back of Patel and Raab. Looks like Boris is going to be  quite happy to take us to WTO rules in 2021...

14/02/2020, 21:06 - Jack G;: Also. Hopefully city will be depressed and we‚Äôll beat them on Wednesday
14/02/2020, 21:14 - David;: Presumably? Would love wolves or Sheffield to have a cheeky shot at the champs league
14/02/2020, 21:15 - David;: But obviously United will grot into 5th somehow despite being woeful
14/02/2020, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: Does that mean not even Europa League for city?
14/02/2020, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: Could be big for the league next year

16/02/2020, 01:54 - Paul;: Love island killing everyone

16/02/2020, 12:30 - / James Ball: I think it's that 46 people were killed by various accidents - top many to list individually

16/02/2020, 13:52 - Rob;: Retrospectively handing the league to Liverpool for the year Gerard slipped at Chelsea and that mental Place game
16/02/2020, 13:53 - Rob;: Would be quite an odd way to take the shine off of Liverpool winning it in style this year: err, actually you technically ended your generation wait to win win the league 6 years ago you just didn't know about it
16/02/2020, 13:53 - Jack G;: Wouldn‚Äôt that give coutinho a league medal too?
16/02/2020, 13:54 - Rob;: Would you do a second bus tour for that league win? Get all the old players back for it
16/02/2020, 13:54 - Jack G;: I imagine they‚Äôd just say there was no winner that season tbh
16/02/2020, 13:55 - Rob;: Nah. I want Liverpool to have to awkwardly celebrate
16/02/2020, 14:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah, wed  celebrate this league title and then celebrate drawing level with utd on 20 league titles
16/02/2020, 14:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Becoming officially the most successful team in england within 1 season
16/02/2020, 14:25 - Rob;: Two league titles, one cup

17/02/2020, 20:02 - David;: Ighalo. The big money Marquee signing
17/02/2020, 20:03 - Sam;: Marquee as in quarantine tent?
17/02/2020, 20:03 - David;: Could randomly work due to the complete lack of expectation
17/02/2020, 20:03 - David;: Yeah isn't he at risk of coronavirus? But still fit to make the bench
17/02/2020, 20:04 - David;: Don't really get it. Seems like a stop gap squad filler but then just bring through the boy greenwood
17/02/2020, 20:05 - Sam;: He‚Äôs our fox. We will release him into opposition boxes to kill their chickens (drink their milkshake) (score goals).

He just eases the pressure on the boy greenwood, only 18. 

He was quarantined for a week as a precautionary measure when he arrived in the UK.
17/02/2020, 20:06 - David;: The diseased fox in the hen house
17/02/2020, 20:07 - David;: Give the defenders coronavirus then score
17/02/2020, 20:07 - Sam;: Yeah yeah. double bubble.

Injury or red card in this game
17/02/2020, 20:11 - David;: On paper this seems like your strongest defence
17/02/2020, 20:12 - David;: Big black guy, slabhead Roy of the rivers English bloke, crossing men on either side. That's a classic
17/02/2020, 20:13 - David;: Glove butler behind
17/02/2020, 20:13 - Sam;: Yeah yeah. Bailly should be a monster.
17/02/2020, 20:15 - David;: Midfield - running man, blocker and passing man. Also quite classic
17/02/2020, 20:16 - David;: The issue is no forwards
17/02/2020, 20:26 - Sam;: Yeah, and martial doing his impression of the invisible man
17/02/2020, 20:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Batshuayi comically baf
17/02/2020, 20:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Bad

17/02/2020, 21:00 - David;: Lol the Vauxhall Corsa ad
17/02/2020, 21:02 - David;: 'some people say I can do better than a Vauxhall Corsa. But who listens to some people'
17/02/2020, 21:03 - David;: Basically admitting your car will be a social embarrassment
17/02/2020, 21:22 - Sam;: Lol. I know people mock will mock you for this but come on. It‚Äôs cheap. Like you
17/02/2020, 22:14 - David;: Lol Maguire 'i was just trying to prop him up'
17/02/2020, 22:14 - David;: Just propping him up by the ball sack with my studs
17/02/2020, 22:14 - David;: Trying to help him actually
17/02/2020, 22:16 - Sam;: It was for his safety actually.
17/02/2020, 22:17 - Sam;: Just rest your bollocks on my studs
17/02/2020, 22:19 - David;: Just offering you a nice comfy studded platform to break your fall onto
17/02/2020, 22:21 - David;: I hate for him to land on this verdant soft turf

18/02/2020, 13:27 - Jack G;: Dortmund vs PSG is pretty big later
18/02/2020, 17:21 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/02/2020, 17:55 - David;: Um Jack are you broken? Liverpool vs Athletico
18/02/2020, 17:55 - David;: The champions of Europe are playing
18/02/2020, 17:56 - Hamish Sinclair: *world
18/02/2020, 17:56 - Hamish Sinclair: I believe
18/02/2020, 17:56 - David;: Ah yes sorry the World champions Jack
18/02/2020, 17:56 - Jack G;: That‚Äôs got 1-0 written all over it. I‚Äôm after some goals
18/02/2020, 18:01 - David;: Have you inferred that from the time we beat Roma 7-6, the time we beat Barca 4-3, the time we beat Porto 6-1 or the time we beat Manchester city 5-1?
18/02/2020, 18:02 - Jack G;: More to do with atletico famously being a defensive team and first legs always being tentative affairs
18/02/2020, 18:02 - Hamish Sinclair: I agree
18/02/2020, 18:03 - Hamish Sinclair: PSG vs dortmund would have been my pick of the rest
18/02/2020, 18:04 - David;: Kieren trippier vs Mane. Back goals there
18/02/2020, 18:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Trippier injured
18/02/2020, 19:42 - David;: Lol dat convoluted mourinho stair metaphor
18/02/2020, 21:36 - Jack G;: Haaland is so good damn
18/02/2020, 21:37 - David;: Jack's predictions accurate tbf
18/02/2020, 21:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Haaland is like a real life cheat code
18/02/2020, 21:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Would love to see psg go out
18/02/2020, 21:42 - Jack G;: Yeah. Surely they must be looking at a ban similar to City? They‚Äôre just as bad
18/02/2020, 21:59 - David;: That second Haaland goal
18/02/2020, 22:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Lol Robertson's interview, never seen a man so angry

19/02/2020, 11:15 - Rob;: Wenger's little offside proposal could change everything
19/02/2020, 11:16 - Jack G;: Yeah seen that. Surely would completely render the offside trap useless
19/02/2020, 11:16 - Jack G;: Could see the return of the sweeper
19/02/2020, 11:17 - Rob;: You'd be onside if any part of you that you are allowed to score with is onside, so you could just have the toe of your trailing leg behind the defender and your head feet ahead
19/02/2020, 11:17 - Rob;: Not a small tweak to bring in just before an international tournament
19/02/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: Pace would get huge
19/02/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: Pace and giraffe necks
19/02/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: Theo Walcrouch the new Messi
19/02/2020, 12:10 - Sam;: nah that just shifts the issue the other way. you could be onside by a toe but have the whole rest of your body 2/3 feet offside. that's to easy for attackers.
19/02/2020, 12:19 - Paul;: What‚Äôs the solution?
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Rob;: This
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Rob;: As in that's Wenger's proposal
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Jack G;: Keep it as it is but give benefit of the doubt to attackers
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Rob;: It would be a huge shift towards favouring attackers
19/02/2020, 12:21 - Jack G;: Also, would make it harder for linesmen to judge offside surely?
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Paul;: But as Sambo says that just flips the issue the other way?
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Sam;: it's all fucked as the linesman cant judge to the same accuracy as VAR anyway so the whole thing needs rethinking..
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Sam;: A TOE.
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Sam;: AN ARMPIT
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Sam;: ruining the game
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Jack G;: How about all players where full body sensor gear and offsides are judged by the rumbletron?
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Jack G;: Wear*
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Jack G;: Instant decision
19/02/2020, 12:24 - Sam;: or ask fifa how they do it on the game..
19/02/2020, 12:24 - Paul;: You should have a challenge like in tennis. Each team gets so many per game and can refer to VAR otherwise ref decisions stand
19/02/2020, 12:26 - Sam;: i think offside is it's own issue within VAR. On every decision where VAR wants to call it the other way, the ref should have to go to the pitch side monitor to make a final decision. players would accept that and fans would know what's going on again. ref's checkin bruv.
19/02/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: Nah that‚Äôs shit. Slows down everything
19/02/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: Just got to hobble over here to watch the game again on the monitor
19/02/2020, 12:27 - Sam;: Why‚Äôs he hobbling?
19/02/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: He‚Äôs a ref
19/02/2020, 12:28 - Jack G;: Have you seen Jonathan Moss?
19/02/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 12:36 - Paul;: Huge anus becomes big component of the game?
19/02/2020, 12:36 - Paul;: This plays right into the hands of the anal sock
19/02/2020, 12:36 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 12:39 - Rob;: Well yeah, if you had a 5 foot anal sock you would basically always be through on goal
19/02/2020, 12:40 - Rob;: Would lead to incredibly deep defending
19/02/2020, 13:14 - Paul;: Long light weight anus highly prized in a striker
19/02/2020, 13:38 - Paul;: The luck of being born with dat sleek aerodynamic anus
19/02/2020, 13:38 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 14:12 - Paul;: The agent for Haaland got paid more than the actual transfer fee for Haaland. Apparently. Huge market for agents. Worth more than the players.
19/02/2020, 14:13 - Sam;: agent Mina Riaola. they trolling united. he's Pogba's agent.
19/02/2020, 14:13 - Paul;: Haalands dad got ‚Ç¨10m in the deal as well
19/02/2020, 14:14 - Paul;: Everyone‚Äôs got there fingers in him
19/02/2020, 14:14 - Sam;: what's your source? the transfer value was 17 mill.
19/02/2020, 14:14 - Paul;: You don‚Äôt need to know the source, this is apparently what happened
19/02/2020, 14:15 - Paul;: That‚Äôs why Haaland was cheap because everyone else was snuffling his money
19/02/2020, 14:16 - Rob;: Snuffling Salzburg's money more like
19/02/2020, 14:17 - Rob;: Would be great is he had more allegiance to Leeds than to Norway
19/02/2020, 14:17 - Rob;: Not England, Yorkshire
19/02/2020, 17:19 - Phill: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 17:19 - Phill: Happy hour. Pelican. ¬£5.90 for all this loot.
19/02/2020, 18:06 - Damian Rumble: Probably couldn't get a pint for that in some parts of London..
19/02/2020, 18:11 - Damian Rumble: I think surely a combination of the two. Offside is only ruled when part of body that you can score a goal with is ahead of the final defender. VAR calls for a review but the review and decision is made by the ref and linesmen on the big screen in the stadium where everyone can see (rather than wasting time by trotting over to a separate monitor and preventing everyone there from seeing why a decision was made).
19/02/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Stay liberal elite.
19/02/2020, 19:19 - Sam;: No, on offside it‚Äôs totally down to the little laptop cunts drawing the lines, ref not involved. And no again, the big screen is for the fans to see it, the ref goes pitchside. 

A delay where we can see the ref pitchside is better and more dramatic to watch than him standing still expressionless with his jebby little finger to his üëÇ
19/02/2020, 19:25 - Jack G;: Why not change it so the offside rule only includes from your foot. Makes more sense, you‚Äôre not gaining an advantage by your bonce being offside, and makes the line drawing easier and more consistent as it would always be from the toe
19/02/2020, 19:38 - Paul;: The idea of a limited number of challenges is clearly better. Works for other sports
19/02/2020, 19:38 - Paul;: Vote Paul‚Äôs VAR solution now
20/02/2020, 09:16 - David;: BBC News - Fashion Institute apologises for 'clearly racist' show
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51564215
20/02/2020, 09:34 - David;: On offside, answer is twofold. Stop drawing the shitty litty crayon lines and have it reffed by human eye as the law was written to be. Second apply the same standard to overturning offside as other decisions already get in VAR, that it has to be clear and obvious to overturn onpitch decision
20/02/2020, 09:35 - David;: Why is that principle used for some decisions but offside policed to the millimeter. It's inconsistent
20/02/2020, 09:36 - Rob;: Yeah
20/02/2020, 09:36 - David;: Felt tip pens smeared over a screen have no place in the game
20/02/2020, 09:37 - Rob;: I quite like the forward vs linesman battle too
20/02/2020, 09:38 - Rob;: Fine to have a system to guard against huge link fuck ups, but give the tubby man with a flag a break and lay off the mm bullshit
20/02/2020, 09:38 - Rob;: *lino fuck ups
20/02/2020, 09:38 - David;: Yeah exactly. Just overturn the obvious howler
20/02/2020, 09:38 - David;: That's what they do with pennos already

21/02/2020, 10:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah hes just a great bloke. Klopp'l fix it
21/02/2020, 10:38 - David;: Awful, awful decent
21/02/2020, 12:25 - Damian Rumble: I reckon there should be some kind of bogus trophy that is given to ever comes last in the Jules chippet. Only it's something extremely unpleasant... Like one of Phil's shits incased in a clear plastic box and with people's names engraved on the side of it..
21/02/2020, 12:25 - Hamish Sinclair: I definitely think something to keep the bottom playing would be a good idea
21/02/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: I‚Äôve got a huge tactic to get back on top anyway. Not worried. Next.
21/02/2020, 12:29 - Jack G;: Play a wild card and copy my team?
21/02/2020, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: As an extreme example, someone I know is in a league with 20 people. They all put ¬£10 in. They buy a random cheap Eurostar day return ticket for the end of the season to a random destination and the losing player has to go to that city in full goalkeeper kit (and gloves) and drink three beers in 3 different bars before returning.

The rest if the money goes to 1st place  2nd gets his stake
21/02/2020, 12:30 - Paul;: Why would I copy the losing team?
21/02/2020, 12:30 - Jack G;: Can‚Äôt get less points than me if we get the same points
21/02/2020, 12:30 - Paul;: I have aspirations higher than second last
21/02/2020, 12:31 - Hamish Sinclair: The low block
21/02/2020, 12:31 - Jack G;: Classic
21/02/2020, 12:31 - Paul;: I refuse to stoop to jacks level
21/02/2020, 12:32 - Paul;: I should triple captain salah against West Ham
21/02/2020, 12:33 - Jack G;: Sounds great
21/02/2020, 12:33 - Jack G;: Do you have to wear football boots as well?
21/02/2020, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: I dont know, would surely add to the comedy value though
21/02/2020, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: The gloves are the best bit
21/02/2020, 12:41 - Jack G;: Still can‚Äôt get over how insane the quality is in Jules Chippet this season. I‚Äôm on track to score 1992 points which is 140 higher than my average score in the season, yet I‚Äôm bottom
21/02/2020, 14:57 - Damian Rumble: Love it... Though a free trip abroad is not much of a punishment for giving up in November
21/02/2020, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: Is it the tactical nonce?
21/02/2020, 16:19 - David;: <Media omitted>

21/02/2020, 18:51 - Phill: Lol you the definition of a mug son
21/02/2020, 19:44 - Sam;: Damo, phil would only be triggered if you were getting lower, non-London prices in London
21/02/2020, 19:44 - Sam;: Which you most certainly are not

21/02/2020, 19:51 - Phill: You're a fucking chump
21/02/2020, 19:51 - Phill: I can get 4 pints for that
21/02/2020, 20:03 - Rob;: Why are you paying service on drinks?
21/02/2020, 20:05 - Damian Rumble: Yeah but do your Friday night drinks come with the smug satisfaction of being part of the liberal elite?
21/02/2020, 20:05 - Damian Rumble: Can't put a price on that...
21/02/2020, 20:06 - Rob;: Damo you're a huge chump here
21/02/2020, 20:08 - Phill: No, they come with satisfaction that somewhere, some idiot, is drinking the same thing and paying 3x as much.
21/02/2020, 20:12 - Phill: ¬£82.49
21/02/2020, 20:17 - Sam;: Christ. That particular receipt.
21/02/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
21/02/2020, 20:23 - Paul;: Throwing up in her mouth 40 times to get moisture?
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Sam;: That‚Äôs my favourite bit.
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Sam;: The only way to survive
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: I wonder how quickly she started doing that?
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: First 30mins
21/02/2020, 20:27 - Paul;: Knowing her husband would be back as well from the night shift
21/02/2020, 20:28 - Sam;: Tormented by bbc news on loop
21/02/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: Throwing up every 18mins on average
21/02/2020, 20:33 - Rob;: How has she convinced herself that throwing up is a method of dehydration?
21/02/2020, 20:33 - Rob;: *rehydration
21/02/2020, 20:34 - Rob;: Removing and putting it back in the same place
21/02/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: Very bott brain approach
21/02/2020, 20:36 - Sam;: Yeah yeah, by the third time she‚Äôs surely already voming painful and disgusting bile
21/02/2020, 20:37 - Paul;: And how can she just vom on command
21/02/2020, 20:37 - Rob;: Lying on the bed on top of your arm. Why not on the floor?
21/02/2020, 21:06 - David;: That reciept
21/02/2020, 21:08 - David;: My bottle of alsatian reisling for the evening cost less than for someone to pour you a couple of g and ts
21/02/2020, 21:09 - Jack G;: How can anyone charge ¬£11 for a glass of tonic with a straight face
21/02/2020, 21:21 - Paul;: Wonder how long until Coronavirus sweeps through the uk
21/02/2020, 21:22 - Damian Rumble: Already had it. No big deal
21/02/2020, 21:22 - Sam;: We‚Äôre doing better at containment than the he filthy Chinese
21/02/2020, 21:23 - Paul;: Reckon it‚Äôs going to get very bad very soon
21/02/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: Nah
21/02/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: Fine
21/02/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: 98% chance of living, without taking into account how healthy you are
21/02/2020, 21:35 - Paul;: But all the coughing around you you‚Äôd have to deal with. The spluttering
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Paul;: Those people with really annoying coughs
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: Right, didn't realize that was your definition of very bad
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Phill: Hopefully it will wipe out London
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Paul;: 60% infected 2% dead. That would be my very bad situation
21/02/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: 60% of the whole UK?
21/02/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: Yeah
21/02/2020, 21:42 - Rob;: So common cold levels of infection?
21/02/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: Yeah. Haven‚Äôt had a cold in a few years. Think I‚Äôm immune now
21/02/2020, 21:43 - Rob;: But you're expecting this to just rifle through mist of the population
21/02/2020, 21:44 - Rob;: More virulent than brexit
21/02/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: Yeah. Couldn‚Äôt predict that. Won‚Äôt predict this

21/02/2020, 22:47 - Rob;: And the resulting child fucking his niece
21/02/2020, 22:48 - Sam;: uncle-niece is the grottiest. Having to look your brother of sister in the eye and acknowledge that
21/02/2020, 22:52 - Stefan;: Makes family gatherings more manageable though
21/02/2020, 22:52 - / James Ball: Also some of the age differences
21/02/2020, 22:52 - Paul;: Very efficient really
21/02/2020, 22:52 - Rob;: Thanks to the magic of portraiture they don't really look very similar
21/02/2020, 22:53 - Rob;: But do you owe your uncle-cousin-brother-father 4 presents?
21/02/2020, 22:54 - / James Ball: 56 and 27 - the ages of Charles II parents when he was born
21/02/2020, 22:54 - Stefan;: Yeah, he's got only 2 ultimate ancestors but you can trace back 4, 5 or 6 generations to them depending on the route
21/02/2020, 22:54 - Rob;: Nah there are more ancestors
21/02/2020, 22:55 - Rob;: Three sets of parents missing from the second row
21/02/2020, 22:57 - Paul;: It‚Äôs just so efficient though. Really streamlined the old family tree
22/02/2020, 07:04 - Paul;: Jack what are your thoughts on the Mercedes DAS system?
22/02/2020, 07:34 - Damian Rumble: Potentially going to guarantee they another Hamilton white wash off a season. Boring
22/02/2020, 07:35 - Jack G;: I think it‚Äôs a pretty cool tech tbh. No idea why they‚Äôre going to ban it next year when they‚Äôre supposed to be a sport of innovation

23/02/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: Big potential
23/02/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: 11 assists or something this season, having not played all the games
23/02/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: One of the few highlights of the season
23/02/2020, 17:31 - Jack G;: Could be huge, tierny Saka on the left could‚Äôve good for a while
23/02/2020, 17:33 - Rob;: Yeah, if he can keep this up and Tierney comes back and stays fit, then those two would be great, and allow Auba to go back in the middle too
23/02/2020, 19:08 - David;: Lacazette ded?
23/02/2020, 19:19 - Rob;: In and out due to poor form

24/02/2020, 20:58 - David;: What I liked about this was the alibi he chose. 'Whall, a sports therapist, maintained throughout the trial that he was having sex with a man in a field on the night Mr Corrigan was shot.'
24/02/2020, 20:59 - David;: Why cottaging as the go-to innocent explanation?
24/02/2020, 21:01 - David;: 'I couldn't have murdered that man because I was having cuckold BDSM intercourse in my sex dungeon several miles away'
24/02/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: Has anyone ever used a murder as an alibi for another murder?
24/02/2020, 21:11 - Paul;: A lesser murder. Could get away without a prison sentence

26/02/2020, 15:04 - David;: Similar gameplay mechanics
26/02/2020, 17:35 - Damian Rumble: As in there are special characters who are charging around the world trying to solve things
26/02/2020, 17:35 - Damian Rumble: Or that a team of people are supposed to be trying to stop the virus but in reality all actions are dominated by the couple who have spent weeks playing it together

26/02/2020, 19:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Agree
26/02/2020, 20:53 - David;: So cats are like mini lions. My idea: we need domesticated mini giraffes, zebras, hippos etc. so you get a complete ecosystem playing out in your house
26/02/2020, 20:53 - David;: Equivalent scale to cats
26/02/2020, 20:53 - Hamish Sinclair: The micro hippo would probably be quite agressibe
26/02/2020, 20:54 - David;: Yeah
26/02/2020, 20:54 - David;: But who thought a small lion would be viable?
26/02/2020, 20:55 - David;: Cats very much have class and sharp teeth. We managed to make that work
26/02/2020, 20:55 - David;: *claws
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: I think basically everything that can be domesticated, already has been
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: Cats weren't domesticated from anything even close to as aggressive or powerful as a lion
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: And people have tried to domesticate zebras with no luck due to their aggression
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: Hippos definitely out - they kill more people than any other animal
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: We basically have mini domesticated zebras, but unfortunately they're not stripey, they're Shetland ponies
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: By if you just want tiny versions with all their natural habits, then there are already pygmy hippos, i guess if someone could be bothered you could just keep selectively breeding the smaller ones
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: Small is probably always attainable with enough work, but tame probably isn't
26/02/2020, 21:32 - Hamish Sinclair: To make tame dont you need to create a selection pressure where the animal benefits from human companionship over generations
26/02/2020, 21:36 - David;: No but has to be to scale with cats Rob. That's the whole premise
26/02/2020, 21:37 - David;: So the giraffe is coming up to your thigh or so
26/02/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: Yeah, and there has to be some tame behaviour to select for in the first place
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: How did the cats become small?
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: Or was it the Lions that went big?
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: What came first?
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: We need to emulate what happened with the cats
26/02/2020, 21:45 - Rob;: Nature had already made them cat sized
26/02/2020, 21:45 - Rob;: They didn't some from lions
26/02/2020, 21:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah dave we didnt just start feeding some lions and end up with cats

26/02/2020, 21:46 - Rob;: Yes, but far back, and they split independantly of human intervention
26/02/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: Split about 11 million years ago apparently
26/02/2020, 21:47 - Paul;: You can‚Äôt lose a cat
26/02/2020, 21:48 - Rob;: At least 4 million years between humans and chimps split
26/02/2020, 21:53 - Rob;: Before, not between
26/02/2020, 21:56 - David;: Yeah so just artificially recreate the same process
26/02/2020, 21:57 - David;: Expose them to similar pressures. Done. Bonzai giraffes/hippos/impalas
26/02/2020, 21:58 - David;: Basically choose the smallest giraffes from each generation and breed them together. Eventually you'll get there  Rob
26/02/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Sure, yeah, possibly. Find the land and money for it,  spend a hundred years on it and I promise i'll buy one
26/02/2020, 22:00 - David;: This is a long term vision.
26/02/2020, 22:00 - David;: But we need to start working on it now
26/02/2020, 22:01 - David;: I'd also like scaled down Chimps hanging off the book shelves etc.
26/02/2020, 22:01 - Rob;: It would be less effort to breed humans bigger
26/02/2020, 22:01 - Rob;: Only one species then
26/02/2020, 22:02 - David;: No but then having to rebuild every house and re-engineer the entire infrastructure
26/02/2020, 22:02 - David;: Big costs there
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Paul;: Could we breed gigantic fruit flies quickly? You can get through generations quickly?
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Rob;: Yes
26/02/2020, 22:02 - David;: But that sounds awful
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Paul;: Make small things big
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Paul;: Let the gnat have its day
26/02/2020, 22:03 - Rob;: Although insects breathe via diffusion, so are limited by oxygen concentration, at current levels oxygen can't reach the middle of organisms much bigger than a tarantula without a circulatory system
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Paul;: So you can get tarantula sized fruit flies
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Rob;: In the dinosaur's day there was more oxygen, so dragonflies were more than a metre long
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Rob;: Perhaps
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Paul;: The appeal is not too high
26/02/2020, 22:04 - David;: Make the weak things huge and the predators tiny until it's a fair fight
26/02/2020, 22:04 - David;: Even everything out
26/02/2020, 22:05 - Paul;: What‚Äôs a small thing we can actually make big quickly? Mice?
26/02/2020, 22:05 - Rob;: Well that is the strategy of big herbivores already
26/02/2020, 22:05 - David;: So a robin sized Hawk is having to take on a cat sized vole
26/02/2020, 22:06 - Rob;: The strategy of the other sis just to have so many offspring it doesn't matter how many get eaten
26/02/2020, 22:07 - Paul;: Have you watched the documentary on iplayer on CRISPR? Scope.
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: No, but Crispr gets big PR
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Huge documentary
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: I'll watch
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Change everything
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Engineer our small animals
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: It was just coming in about my last year of uni, billed as huge then
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: Yeah it‚Äôs massive
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: You can edit dna
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: Using a snipping cell thing
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: CAS 9
26/02/2020, 22:10 - Paul;: A protein that snips
26/02/2020, 22:10 - Rob;: What we need are artificial wombs. Then with DNA editing you could make anything
26/02/2020, 22:12 - Rob;: Thing is DNA is weird. No one designed it. It's mental to observe. Huge stretches of seemingly incising information. Double, treble feedback loops. It's not very intuitive from a human perspective, which makes editing it it. Slow process of trial and error
26/02/2020, 22:12 - Rob;: *seemingly uncoding information
26/02/2020, 22:12 - Paul;: Some guy tries to claim he came up with it making yoghurt and he has the number plate CRISPR for good measure
26/02/2020, 22:21 - David;: BBC News - Joe Biden drops claim he was arrested seeing Mandela
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51648166

27/02/2020, 22:26 - David;: At what level might she get involved. Semi finals?
27/02/2020, 22:26 - David;: Finals?
27/02/2020, 22:26 - David;: You'd force her to watch a final surely
27/02/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: Watching is a bit different to going
27/02/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: I've taken her to one League cup game
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Was it vs liverpool? What an introduction
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: But TV games she's more up for, she'll do a Spurs derby or any big one of it means I'll have to go to the pub on my own if she doesn't come
27/02/2020, 22:28 - David;: Ah you're at the stadium for this?
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: Yeah
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: ...and we're out

27/02/2020, 22:29 - David;: That's the one thing you needed not to happen
27/02/2020, 22:30 - David;: You'd be calling that very poor defending
27/02/2020, 22:32 - Paul;: So now you go and drown your sorrows and come back a rotten stinking mess?
27/02/2020, 22:33 - David;: Ah Auba as well
27/02/2020, 22:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah the aubameyang chance
27/02/2020, 22:33 - David;: Fuck that
27/02/2020, 22:33 - Hamish Sinclair: I swear that went in
27/02/2020, 22:34 - David;: You'd dwell on that
27/02/2020, 22:34 - David;: That will stay with you
27/02/2020, 22:34 - Paul;: How much of a powerhouse are olympiakos?

28/02/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Old news. It's hundreds of millions of light years away happened ages ago
28/02/2020, 17:21 - David;: Is it old news ifthe information couldn't physically have reached you sooner?
28/02/2020, 17:22 - David;: Are all archaeology discoveries old news by definition?
28/02/2020, 17:23 - Rob;: Yep
28/02/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: I like how I'd there are other civilisations many light years away observing the universe they will have a completely different picture
28/02/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: Like they're getting light from the earth before it even had a moon
28/02/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: Everyone's intel is woefully shit
28/02/2020, 17:27 - David;: Galaxy could already have been half taken over by a tyrranid swarm. We'd be none the wiser.
28/02/2020, 17:29 - David;: Can't wait for the Andromeda Galaxy to pass through us
28/02/2020, 17:33 - David;: Apparently betelgeuse is going to explode. So we may lose Orion's left shoulder.
28/02/2020, 17:33 - David;: Replaced by a giant dust cloud
28/02/2020, 17:54 - Damian Rumble: Kind of novel but it's not a treatment of how well an academic was able to dress up story about some slightly misshaped galaxies
28/02/2020, 17:55 - Damian Rumble: Now Betelgeuse... That makes me VERY moist
28/02/2020, 18:10 - David;: How big in the sky would a betelgeuse supernova appear?
28/02/2020, 18:24 - Damian Rumble: About the same size as the moon

28/02/2020, 21:55 - / James Ball: I've worked on a couple of other events there. I've strapped speakers and lights to those girders before now
29/02/2020, 09:01 - David;: You've managed to free hit in 1 player who has a blank fixture this week, 2 players unlikely to start and an injured player. Quite an achievement
29/02/2020, 09:01 - David;: What was the thinking behind Gilmour?
29/02/2020, 09:05 - Paul;: This week is a bit of a shit storm
29/02/2020, 10:11 - Damian Rumble: I picked up a couple of players who were dirt cheap and never going to start
29/02/2020, 10:12 - Damian Rumble: Exactly why vardy didn't play I have no idea though ... And Abraham wasn't listed as injured in Friday
29/02/2020, 10:20 - Rob;: My team looks mental. It saved my transfers but not team rearrangement. Won't matter as substitutions will sort it out, but I don't like looking mad
29/02/2020, 10:20 - Rob;: I also got trolled by Vardy
29/02/2020, 10:23 - Jack G;: I tried to be clever and captained Maddison

01/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Yeah, but isolating ourselves with the disease carriers in close quarters

01/03/2020, 18:10 - / James Ball: I'm having wagonwheel-gate with Harriet currently. We're moving house and I bought some nostalgic wagonwheels (jammie variety) as a nice moving house snack. She'd never had them before. Instant hate from her "the chocolate is bland" "the biscuit tastes of nothing" "the jam is cheap".
01/03/2020, 18:11 - / James Ball: Where do people stand on wagonwheels?

01/03/2020, 18:14 - David;: What purpose do they serve?
01/03/2020, 18:14 - Jack G;: If you‚Äôre after jam, jammy dodger, if you‚Äôre after chocolate literally anything else. Wagon wheels are dogshit

02/03/2020, 13:43 - / James Ball: Nice. A banging night in Hanley town centre with the skagheads
02/03/2020, 13:43 - / James Ball: Convivial wedding atmos
02/03/2020, 14:28 - David;: Congrats!
02/03/2020, 14:29 - David;: Should really have done it on Saturday (29th), then it only come around once every 4 years.
02/03/2020, 14:29 - David;: That would be optimal, keep anniversaries down the frequency of world cups.

02/03/2020, 19:42 - Sam;: Have you watched the two part documentary on him? On itv.
02/03/2020, 19:44 - Sam;: Always feels like he‚Äôs talking shit but then he pulls a bit of logic out of bag. Plus he a heavyweight champion so he‚Äôs no chancer, or dosser as he would say
02/03/2020, 20:23 - Damian Rumble: Would be funny if a side effect of Coronavirus would be the complete collapse of the Corona beer company. No one wanting to buy a product associated with a global pandemic
02/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: There is a stat on that already you may have seen?
02/03/2020, 20:24 - Rob;: That, when asked, about 40% of Americans said they would never consider buying Corona again

03/03/2020, 13:31 - Jack G;: Twice the pain
03/03/2020, 13:32 - David;: The Nations League qualification dynamic is so complicated I've given up even bothering to understand it.
03/03/2020, 13:32 - Sam;: Yeah it‚Äôs due to their coefficient, they get two chances
03/03/2020, 13:33 - Damian Rumble: Germany France Portugal sounds very familiar...
03/03/2020, 13:33 - David;: If they win both do they have to play themsevles?
03/03/2020, 13:33 - Sam;: Yes
03/03/2020, 13:35 - David;: Think France have to be favourites
03/03/2020, 13:35 - David;: Then Germany, Spain, Netherlands us in with a shout. Italy ded.
03/03/2020, 13:36 - Jack G;: Wonder if coronavirus will impact anything. Like an extreme mode on football manager
03/03/2020, 13:37 - David;: They haven't even got a goalkeeper - I've heard he's Donnarummer
03/03/2020, 13:38 - Jack G;: Hebib
03/03/2020, 13:39 - David;: It's annoying at the beginning of the season I would have been confident but then Kane ded, Rashford ded, Abraham ded, Sterling in bad form, Pickford shit.
03/03/2020, 13:40 - Jack G;: Kane and Rashford due to be back by Euros though? Sterling will come good
03/03/2020, 13:40 - Jack G;: GK big issue though for sure
03/03/2020, 13:41 - David;: Yeah but there legs still being reattached. Won't have any form.
03/03/2020, 13:42 - David;: They will have only had a few games to get fit/sharp.
03/03/2020, 13:42 - David;: Hendo also currently ded
03/03/2020, 13:43 - Sam;: Dean Henderson for GK
03/03/2020, 13:45 - David;: Grealish has to start
03/03/2020, 13:45 - David;: The new Gazza
03/03/2020, 13:45 - David;: Our most creative midfielder
03/03/2020, 13:46 - Jack G;: Yeah Grealish has got to be in there
03/03/2020, 13:46 - David;: Front four of Sterling, Grealish, Sancho behind Kane. Decent
03/03/2020, 13:46 - David;: Hendo and Ox or Rice holding behind that
03/03/2020, 13:46 - Jack G;: Is Deli Alli just a write off now? Put shit in bin?
03/03/2020, 13:47 - David;: Nah decent. Just wouldn't start him over either of those 4
03/03/2020, 13:47 - David;: Don't rate him on the wing and then of our number 10s I'd choose Grealish over Maddison of Alli on current form
03/03/2020, 13:48 - David;: Back 4 Chilwell, Slabhead, Gomez, Trent
03/03/2020, 13:48 - David;: Pope in goal?
03/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: I vote Pope
03/03/2020, 13:51 - David;: Is loftus cheek ded?
03/03/2020, 13:53 - Jack G;: Hudson odoi too
03/03/2020, 13:54 - David;: Stones seems to be a piece of shit now
03/03/2020, 14:08 - Jack G;: Considering City okay Otamendi ahead of him I‚Äôd say so

03/03/2020, 20:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
03/03/2020, 20:42 - David;: Who could we get who's better but prepared to play as little as he does though?
03/03/2020, 20:43 - David;: (meant for the Liverpool thread)
03/03/2020, 20:45 - Sam;: Fretting over Adam Banana‚Äôs departure ay?
03/03/2020, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Van dijk actually
03/03/2020, 20:50 - David;: In fact, Origi
03/03/2020, 20:59 - Sam;: Oh-rigi?
03/03/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Klopp's gone and lost 3 in 3 just to please that United fan who wrote to him
03/03/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Classic peado ruse
03/03/2020, 22:00 - Sam;: PEADOPOOL
03/03/2020, 22:26 - Damian Rumble: I think this only goes to prove that nothing can stand against the will of a small child
04/03/2020, 13:04 - Rob;: The amount of people stockpiling antibacterial alcohol gel to pretext themselves from a virus
04/03/2020, 13:04 - Rob;: Not going to work
04/03/2020, 13:29 - Sam;: I think it‚Äôs a cheap way to get pissed when we inevitably enter the apocalypse that corona will bring

04/03/2020, 18:28 - David;: Pull out while you still can
04/03/2020, 18:28 - David;: They're a shit show at the best of times.
04/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: One had a flight to Edinburgh landing at 9pm. They got me to Glasgow at 3am.
04/03/2020, 19:14 - Jack G;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51744374
04/03/2020, 19:14 - Jack G;: No time to die
04/03/2020, 19:17 - Stefan;: My mate who works at Huffington Post said they came up with a lot of puns for this
04/03/2020, 19:18 - Stefan;: But they were all too poor taste to publisb
04/03/2020, 19:18 - Stefan;: publish
05/03/2020, 08:41 - / James Ball: Flybe dead. Need to book a new flight Jack
05/03/2020, 08:42 - Jack G;: Yeah. No one else does flights to Cornwall though... have filed a request with my credit card company for a refund

05/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Apparently the panic buying has mainly focussed on bog roll. How much are people shitting that that's the first concern?
05/03/2020, 19:00 - Rob;: Yeah I found that odd
05/03/2020, 19:01 - Rob;: I've never seen relentless shiting listed as symptom
05/03/2020, 19:05 - Damian Rumble: That's a no-deal brexit thing right?
05/03/2020, 20:20 - David;: <Media omitted>
05/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: Arancini balls. Such a great premise for a food.
05/03/2020, 20:22 - David;: So you've already cooked risotto, which is itself mainly carbs soaked in butter, cheese and stock. So you wrap that around mozzarella, slather it in egg, flour and bread and then deep fry the whole thing.
05/03/2020, 20:23 - David;: 2 types of cheese, 2 different fats and 3 carbs in one meal.
05/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: Yeah, with excellent textural contrast
05/03/2020, 20:24 - David;: It's like an upmarket vegetarian KFC.
05/03/2020, 20:26 - David;: <Media omitted>
05/03/2020, 20:50 - Damian Rumble: So it's like a scotch egg but for veggies? Not a big fan of scotch eggs tbh
05/03/2020, 21:20 - Rob;: Except that's there's no egg
05/03/2020, 21:35 - Rob;: And it's got a completely different texture and taste
05/03/2020, 21:35 - Rob;: And is more likely to be served very hot
05/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: And only one common ingredient
05/03/2020, 21:52 - David;: Yeah, the egg inside is a ball of cheese, the pork bit is risotto and it's hot. Similar look but different flavours

07/03/2020, 12:55 - Jack G;: Yes Salah you beauty
07/03/2020, 13:29 - Rob;: Every time I change my captain, Fantasy doesn't change it. No idea why. It's been Trent for weeks.
07/03/2020, 13:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Understandable, best right back in the world
07/03/2020, 13:47 - Rob;: It's not been a disaster, but I chose Mane this week
07/03/2020, 13:48 - Jack G;: Why not a city or arsenal player? Double game week for them
07/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: The only one I had was Debruyne, who's doubtful
07/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: Wary of next week too
07/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: And it wouldn't have mattered anyway, as i'd somehow have got Trent anyway
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Jack G;: No arsenal players? Surprising
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Hamish Sinclair: I've invested in arsenal
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Their on the up
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Jack G;: Martinelli the early season Origi
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Rob;: I just can't get burnt again
07/03/2020, 13:51 - Rob;: Loyalty burned me
07/03/2020, 13:51 - Rob;: Martinelli out of the team more recently
07/03/2020, 13:51 - Rob;: No arsenal game next week
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Jack G;: He‚Äôs playing much better than Lacazette though, should be starting
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Did I no want to hear this
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Sam;: Arsenal city on Wednesday bro
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Rob;: Part of this gameweek on Fantasy Football
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Rob;: Only 4 games next game week
07/03/2020, 13:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, should have done my research
07/03/2020, 14:01 - Sam;: Fuuuuuck
07/03/2020, 14:33 - Hamish Sinclair: This is wrong. They're playing brighton
07/03/2020, 14:38 - Damian Rumble: This really crept up on me
07/03/2020, 14:39 - Rob;: Ah yeah, week after next is the four-game week
07/03/2020, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: What is this?
07/03/2020, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: This wasn't in the calendar when I decided to use my free hit earlier
07/03/2020, 14:40 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 14:41 - Rob;: Because no one knew who would get to an FA cup quarter final
07/03/2020, 14:41 - Damian Rumble: Fuck that. That competition can fuck off.
07/03/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: Only football robots like you think that
07/03/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: The magic of the cup
07/03/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: Magic > data
07/03/2020, 15:29 - Jack G;: Arteta‚Äôs hairline is ridiculously good
07/03/2020, 15:41 - Rob;: The high press
07/03/2020, 16:36 - David;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: You done this Phil?
07/03/2020, 16:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Is phil a "sure footed fold with a  head for heights"
07/03/2020, 17:22 - David;: Rob why no Bellerin? Explain this.
07/03/2020, 17:22 - David;: I give them one chance. Let me down instantly.
07/03/2020, 17:23 - Jack G;: Bellerout
07/03/2020, 17:23 - Rob;: Not completely sure, beyond that he's been a bit broken this season and they might not have wanted to risk him
07/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: He's climbed the ridge he'll be fine
07/03/2020, 17:30 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 17:31 - David;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: Small view
07/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: Unless there's a higher logic in play where they are anticipating the stodgy carb diet?
07/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: But that should bung things up if anything
07/03/2020, 17:34 - Jack G;: Time to invest stocks in bidets
07/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: People seem more concerned with having a shitty arse than starving to death
07/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: It's illogical - so many substitutes for bog roll if pushed. Newspapers. Grass.
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Sam;: Lol, grass. How? Are you weaving into a sheet or just bunch a fistful and hoping for structural integration?
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: Just showering after a shit
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: Better than grass
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Jack G;: We dint all have a sloppy, shitty disaster of an arsehole Sam. Grass is fine
07/03/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: If you get Corona virus, are you really going to be eating loads? Most people go off food when fevery
07/03/2020, 17:39 - Jack G;: The diarrhea though
07/03/2020, 17:40 - Rob;: Is that actually a symptom?
07/03/2020, 17:41 - Rob;: Not listed on NHS's page about it
07/03/2020, 17:41 - Jack G;: Pretty sure I‚Äôve seen it listed as a symptom. Need confirmation from dr Sinclair
07/03/2020, 17:42 - David;: Grab a good bunch. Wipe arse.
07/03/2020, 17:42 - Rob;: Must have been such a good year for the loo roll folks
07/03/2020, 17:42 - Hamish Sinclair: No diarrhoea. But if you're self isolating for 14days and cant leave the house you're going to need a lot of bog roll and wank tissues
07/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: 14 days I think I would need 2 rolls max
07/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: How much are you shitting?
07/03/2020, 17:43 - Jack G;: Just consume a lots of fibre
07/03/2020, 17:43 - Jack G;: Minimal shifting
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Rob;: That would make you shit more, Jack
07/03/2020, 17:45 - David;: Yeah. Last thing you need is a lentil dahl
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Jack G;: I thought it just made your shit more solid?
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Rob;: No, the opposite
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Jack G;: Or have I succumbed to fake news
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: It's just any food you can't digest. Increases the bulk of your shit, and the throughput
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Jack G;: Ah
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Jack G;: So bran flakes are out
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: Lol, yes
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: Haha
07/03/2020, 17:47 - Rob;: 'I seem to be shotting more. I must need more dried apricots and beans'
07/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Ah that whole last bit of the thread has killed me
07/03/2020, 17:56 - Rob;: I'm glad we cleared this up before you self isolated Jack
07/03/2020, 17:57 - Rob;: You might have accidentally given yourself diarrhea by trying to prevent yourself from getting diarrhea that wasn't actually on its way anyway
07/03/2020, 18:00 - David;: Hamish has interesting data on apricots
07/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: Volume
07/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: Colour
07/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: All affected by apricot
07/03/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: That's what the Foo Fighters' 1997 album The Colour and the Shape is about

07/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: I made an entire floor of my house a no go zone
07/03/2020, 20:54 - Phill: Haven't done it. Will do it next year
07/03/2020, 21:26 - Phill: Also it's in the Black Cuillins. Which is a big NO in winter with two small dogs
07/03/2020, 21:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 21:27 - Phill: That's those things. DAT snow. DAT ice. DAT wind.
07/03/2020, 21:27 - Phill: It's got mountain rescue written all over it.
07/03/2020, 21:46 - David;: You'd be fine. I back you
07/03/2020, 21:46 - David;: Just take a coat
07/03/2020, 21:47 - David;: Good pair of socks
07/03/2020, 21:52 - Phill: Some Indians walking up Storr in flip flops on Thursday
07/03/2020, 21:52 - Phill: 6 inches of snow
07/03/2020, 21:52 - Phill: -3
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Sam;: Lol, you witnessed that Phil?
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Phill: Yeah
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Phill: 2 Indian blokes
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Phill: Just trotting up the mountain path
07/03/2020, 21:56 - Phill: Not concerned
07/03/2020, 21:56 - Sam;: Is the path covered in 6 inches?
07/03/2020, 21:58 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 22:05 - Sam;: Lol. Flip flops on that.
07/03/2020, 22:09 - Phill: Hamish how is it on the front line of Covid-19?
07/03/2020, 22:09 - Damian Rumble: That's pretty lord of the rings
07/03/2020, 22:09 - Damian Rumble: "they're taking the hobbits to isengard"
07/03/2020, 22:10 - Phill: I've been out of the loop for a week and now can't seem to buy bog roll or soap
07/03/2020, 22:10 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm gagging for a period of self isolation
07/03/2020, 22:11 - Phill: Are you pretty much resigned to getting the virus?
07/03/2020, 22:13 - Phill: It is ebin.
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: Lol match of the day
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: No handshakes
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: Immediately followed by players grappling with each other and handling each other for set pieces
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: So pointless
07/03/2020, 23:23 - Rob;: Liked this paragraph in an article about life in Wuhan

07/03/2020, 23:26 - Rob;: (such a good joke)
08/03/2020, 09:01 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 09:11 - Rob;: Lol. Trying to nudge theory the most powerful man in the world out of ice cream
08/03/2020, 09:12 - Phill: Also hate this idea that adding a healthy food to an unhealthy food somehow makes it less fattening
08/03/2020, 09:13 - Rob;: Yeah, it's not the potato in mashed potato that makes it unhealthy
08/03/2020, 09:13 - Rob;: It's the milk, butter and salt
08/03/2020, 09:13 - Phill: Becca says it all the time with salad. Asks if I want salad with dinner. I say no. She says it's good for you. Doesn't understand that by not eating the salad I am consuming less calories
08/03/2020, 09:14 - Rob;: Good fibre in salad though Phil
08/03/2020, 09:14 - Phill: But what if I'm eating a bean chilli and brown rice.
08/03/2020, 09:14 - Rob;: Well yeah, more fibre in that
08/03/2020, 09:15 - Phill: Must I also consume an extra 200cals in leaf and oil?
08/03/2020, 09:15 - Rob;: Obviously not
08/03/2020, 09:16 - Rob;: But in a different meal, replacing say 6 chips with a handful of salad leaves would beneficial
08/03/2020, 09:16 - Phill: In theory.
08/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: The salad has to itself not be oily/calorific etc and be eatin instead of something worse
08/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: But more variation is always a plus
08/03/2020, 09:17 - Phill: But in practice it never is. It's always an extra.
08/03/2020, 09:18 - Phill: I'm still going to eat the same amount of burger regardless of if I have a token salad on the side.
08/03/2020, 09:18 - Rob;: Yeah, you'd have to swap some chips
08/03/2020, 09:18 - Phill: Not going to happen. Fake news.
08/03/2020, 09:19 - Rob;: But only eating burger and never ever having any vegetables because they would be _more calories_ would just leave your enzymes craving vitamins
08/03/2020, 09:20 - Rob;: For the small reward of having cut the least calorific element of the meal
08/03/2020, 09:20 - Phill: Just take a multivitamin. Next.
08/03/2020, 09:20 - Rob;: Fine. But I would enjoy eating a salad more than popping a pill
08/03/2020, 09:22 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 09:22 - Rob;: 5 stars... Reasonably neutral taste. Would neutrally taste again.
08/03/2020, 17:57 - David;: It's not certain your body absorbs multivitamin tablets in the same way as vitamins from fruit and veg
08/03/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: I am very much twitching my ass on the bench here
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Hows that arsr?
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Sam;: Very happy arse now.
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Sam;: Thank you Ederson
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Hamish Sinclair: What a happy arse
08/03/2020, 19:20 - David;: Just had a very Scottish dining experience. In a fish and chip bar, the fish and chips come with a mandatory free side of bread and butter.
08/03/2020, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Battered?
08/03/2020, 19:21 - Rob;: They do that up north too
08/03/2020, 19:21 - David;: So unecessary. You're ordering a meal of carbs and fat. I assume you'll need a side of carbs and fat to go with that.
08/03/2020, 19:22 - Rob;: Or down south, from a Scottish perspective
08/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Yeah. I'd like to map the bread frontier
08/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Imagine it goes somewhere along the midlands
08/03/2020, 19:22 - Rob;: Grimsby is the furthest south I've experienced it
08/03/2020, 19:23 - Rob;: Different, but in Leamington if you ordered a chip batch, assuming that mean a big batch of chips, you actually got a chip butty with your meal.
08/03/2020, 19:24 - David;: That was actually the main legacy of Roman occupation I've heard. The Scottish tribes continued to serve bread with their chips as a sign of freedom and resistance
08/03/2020, 19:24 - David;: With the chips as well though? Like it's an extra not a substitute
08/03/2020, 19:25 - Damian Rumble: That sounds like bollocks to me
08/03/2020, 19:25 - David;: Well yes it was a joke
08/03/2020, 19:25 - Rob;: Lol
08/03/2020, 19:26 - Rob;: Nah, disappointing sub. You got extra bread roll and fewer chips, when to a non-midlander it sounds like more chips
08/03/2020, 19:27 - David;: Yeah I would want it as a side with my chips
08/03/2020, 19:27 - Rob;: Would be good if this is how you processed all jokes. Goes to comedy show. Everyone else laughs while you call bullshit on every story
08/03/2020, 19:29 - Rob;: A thing I've really come to learn about fish and chips as I've got older is that it's all about the sauces. I want curry sauce, mushy peas and ketchup
08/03/2020, 19:29 - Rob;: There's a lot of stodge and increasingly cold fat to cut through
08/03/2020, 19:29 - Rob;: So much more vinegar needed than they think you need
08/03/2020, 19:30 - David;: Yeah you can't trust them with vinegar and salt levels they need manual adjustment
08/03/2020, 19:30 - David;: Pints of vinegar Rob
08/03/2020, 19:30 - Rob;: I could dip chips into a pint of it
08/03/2020, 19:30 - Rob;: A good serving suggestion
08/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: The type of vinegar also crucial
08/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: Need to be that darker chip shop vinegar not generic malt
08/03/2020, 19:31 - Rob;: Yeah. Has to be 100% opaque
08/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: Or, at the other end of this chip spectrum that really cheap spray on vinegar that is like battery acid. Actually works well
08/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: For the sort of chips that come in styrofoam
08/03/2020, 19:33 - David;: Chippy lido style
08/03/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: Chippy lido is a pretty high calibre local day out
08/03/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: Obviously shit
08/03/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: But on a hot day, the combo of refreshing pool, relaxing field and grotty shop is amazing
08/03/2020, 19:38 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 19:39 - Phill: People honking in wow
08/03/2020, 19:42 - David;: The new steam room they've put in is great. But always seems to be closed/broken
08/03/2020, 22:13 - Rob;: And that's Crufts

08/03/2020, 22:13 - David;: Shangri la at Glasto will have a good time with coronavirus surely
08/03/2020, 22:13 - David;: It basically is a real life Shangri la theme
09/03/2020, 13:57 - Jack G;: How can the government claim that we‚Äôre still in a containment phase with coronavirus while simultaneously accepting it will spread in a significant way. Negligent
09/03/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: Told you we‚Äôd be fucked
09/03/2020, 14:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Hope everyones got their bogroll
09/03/2020, 14:07 - Jack G;: I‚Äôd invest in stocks in Andrex but looks like share prices have fallen so much that trading has been suspended
09/03/2020, 14:07 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt shit if your dead jack
09/03/2020, 14:08 - Rob;: Two weeks ago Italy had fewer cases than we do now and followed the same containment procedures as we are now
09/03/2020, 14:09 - Rob;: Can't wait to get quarantined
09/03/2020, 14:10 - Rob;: My work has two major clients: British Airways and Tesco
09/03/2020, 14:10 - Paul;: Is the Coronavirus more deadly than they first thought?
09/03/2020, 14:11 - Rob;: One getting absolutely fucked, one feasibly doing very well in the short term out of it. Hard to know how it'll go
09/03/2020, 14:12 - Jack G;: I think it‚Äôs still quite uncertain. A lot of unreported cases where people were fine skewing it. Still not ideal though and apparently reinfection is a thing
09/03/2020, 14:17 - Jack G;: Imagine if this happened with something deadlier than coronavirus, would be complete chaos
09/03/2020, 14:30 - Rob;: It probably wouldn't move as quickly - really deadly things are obvious and get contained quickly. They also limit their own transmission by killing their hosts before they spread it too far
09/03/2020, 14:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Apparently they have considered just getting it over and done with and letting it spread thought wh population quickly
09/03/2020, 14:31 - Hamish Sinclair: But think they predicted 500k deatha
09/03/2020, 14:31 - Hamish Sinclair: The current plans are based on trying to contain it until summer
09/03/2020, 14:31 - Rob;: This one is quite exceptional in being symptomless while infectious, possible to mistake for other diseases, and very survivable. Good properties for wide spreading
09/03/2020, 14:39 - Stefan;: Yeah the issue with letting it spread quickly is you get a massive peak of cases which overwhelms the health system
09/03/2020, 14:39 - Stefan;: Which exponentially increases deaths directly from coronavirus, and indirectly from other illnesses which people can't get treated for
09/03/2020, 14:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Not enough intensive care beds
09/03/2020, 14:40 - Jack G;: Also there have been quite a few cases of reinfection so it‚Äôs not even getting the problem out of the way
09/03/2020, 14:41 - Rob;: Is reinfection confirmed as a secondary infection? Or people becoming ill again after a latency period? I had only heard of the latter, and it was suggested people weren't contagious at that point
09/03/2020, 14:41 - Jack G;: Not sure tbh, but worrying nonetheless
09/03/2020, 15:24 - Damian Rumble: Yeah but most of those are baby boomers
09/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: Yes, excellent, our parents
09/03/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: The oldest boomer is actually 74, so I guess it will actually kill more of whatever the generation above them is called
09/03/2020, 15:42 - Stefan;: In the US they're called the Silent Generation
09/03/2020, 15:45 - Rob;: No wonder I hadn't heard of them
09/03/2020, 23:36 - Rob;: Dark Waters is big
09/03/2020, 23:37 - Rob;: Dupont are very naughty boys
09/03/2020, 23:46 - David;: hib
09/03/2020, 23:49 - Damian Rumble: Cracking weekend in FPL. Points everywhere. Just making up for the inevitable crushing FA cup weekend though

10/03/2020, 12:27 - Sam;: last one.. what starts with. a T ends in a T and has tea in it.
10/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: A tit cus it has a baby's tea in it
10/03/2020, 12:29 - Sam;: correct
10/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: Quarantine when
10/03/2020, 18:45 - David;: Well, she was covid-19,
You know what I mean
And the way she spread
Was way beyond control
10/03/2020, 18:49 - David;: Covideo Killed the Radio Star
10/03/2020, 18:53 - David;: Covid-19 Killed the Radio Star

11/03/2020, 07:29 - Rob;: What is it with football club owners being coronavirus forerunners
11/03/2020, 07:31 - Rob;: Olympiakos, Nottingham Forest
11/03/2020, 07:31 - Rob;: Is it just that rich people get themselves tested?
11/03/2020, 07:49 - Damian Rumble: @447526575752 how do you feel about the arsenal man city game being postponed?
11/03/2020, 07:58 - Hamish Sinclair: It's true that the impending pandemic has scuppered my fantasy football efforts. This is the first time I've ever used the free hit chip, would not return again
11/03/2020, 08:01 - Damian Rumble: Luckily Phil had a decidedly average week so it's not the end of the world
11/03/2020, 08:02 - Rob;: Several Arsenal players have now been asked to self isolate
11/03/2020, 08:02 - Rob;: Fantasy football might be fucked, lads
11/03/2020, 08:02 - Rob;: You think Ozil could survive a brush with anything?
11/03/2020, 08:03 - Jack G;: What about the actual premier league too. Could end up getting cancelled similar to serie a. No title given out
11/03/2020, 08:03 - Sam;: Lol. He owns both clubs you nugget
11/03/2020, 08:17 - Damian Rumble: Nah just do it the same as the six Nations. Just make arsenal  play all thier matches in the summer/autumn
11/03/2020, 08:21 - Rob;: Ah. There we go
11/03/2020, 08:21 - Rob;: Not sure I approve of that
11/03/2020, 08:22 - Sam;: >autumn. Fuck up next season as well.
11/03/2020, 08:23 - Rob;: Perhaps it will be called off and Liverpool won't ever technically be champions
11/03/2020, 08:25 - David;: Ozil is gone. Even if he hasn't got it the panic will overwhelm his immune systems
11/03/2020, 08:26 - Jack G;: Liverpool need 2 more wins for the title? In a race against COVID-19
11/03/2020, 08:28 - David;: Which arsenal players though? That's key FF information
11/03/2020, 08:43 - Rob;: Apparently since they met him almost two weeks ago at the match, their isolation period is almost over
11/03/2020, 08:44 - Rob;: Back in group training on Friday
11/03/2020, 08:45 - Rob;: I was also at that match. Currently fine
11/03/2020, 08:46 - Rob;: I'm hoping for someone at work to get it very mildly just after I've moved house next week, then I can spend my self isolation painting and decorating
11/03/2020, 08:46 - Rob;: Stockpiling sandpaper not toilet paper

11/03/2020, 09:52 - Phill: Are you buying with Julia or solo ?
11/03/2020, 09:53 - Rob;: But perhaps lesser cunts in a sea of cunts
11/03/2020, 09:53 - Rob;: Together. Big plunge, but we've watch a lot of homes under the hammer together so we're prepared
11/03/2020, 09:54 - Rob;: Yeah, for London on a first time buyer budget it's big. The downside is it's on a fairly busy road, but it's a long house, so we can shift most of the living space to the back
11/03/2020, 09:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Garden looks big
11/03/2020, 09:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Need a BBq

11/03/2020, 17:50 - Paul;: Probably hoping to hold out a quarantine until Easter holiday?
11/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: The cut off for a ventilator in italy is 65
11/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Which is pretty brutal
11/03/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: When will they quarantine?
11/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Why does Italy have such a higher death rate than elsewhere. Purely demographics?
11/03/2020, 18:49 - Hamish Sinclair: It's not so much the mortality it's the surge of cases
11/03/2020, 18:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Has overwhelmed their hospitals
11/03/2020, 18:51 - David;: But also 800 dead from 12,000. Almost 7%
11/03/2020, 18:52 - David;: Unless they are very shit at testing
11/03/2020, 18:53 - David;: So it skews results. We are 6 dead from 450. Much lower as a % of cases
11/03/2020, 18:53 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 18:54 - David;: So they are testing. Just high case rate and deaths.
11/03/2020, 18:55 - Stefan;: https://www.livescience.com/why-italy-coronavirus-deaths-so-high.html
3 reasons: older population, health service overwhelmed in local areas, and mild cases going undetected
11/03/2020, 18:55 - David;: Old population plus social dynamics I guess
11/03/2020, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah this
11/03/2020, 18:55 - David;: But why mild cases undetected if they're 2nd highest test rate globally?
11/03/2020, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: The milder cases undetected is pretty key
11/03/2020, 18:56 - Stefan;: Interesting that death rate per case was 5.8% in Wuhan but only 0.7% in rest of China, which they attribute to the local health system being overwhelmed by volume of cases
11/03/2020, 18:58 - Stefan;: Probably because the real number of infections per head is so much higher than other countries with high testing rates. So more are missed
11/03/2020, 18:59 - Rob;: I would imagine once it's spread to all areas and you have sustained community transmission, testing becomes a much lower priority
11/03/2020, 18:59 - Rob;: Probably get lots of people who have it just staying in and not engaging with health care at all
11/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: So really does point to acting soon and smoothing peak out. Can't let it get away from you
11/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, the mortality is actually highly dependent on resources, mainly Intensive care beds
11/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Meant to reply to this...
11/03/2020, 19:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Also the demand on these resources from other illnesses will not just go away during the next month, so the hidden mortality underlying this may be the people who died from other illness but couldn't get care because of civid19
11/03/2020, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm buying bogroll as we speak
11/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: 10 times more lethal than seasonal flu they‚Äôre saying
11/03/2020, 19:27 - Paul;: How empty are shelves looking?
11/03/2020, 19:29 - David;: I guess we're lucky that at least it seems to be evenly spreading across the UK less intense demand on any given region. Italy got fucked in tensely in one small area at first
11/03/2020, 19:29 - David;: Hand sanitizer gone from  my supermarket.
11/03/2020, 19:30 - Rob;: Bog roll entirely gone in my local Aldi
11/03/2020, 19:30 - Paul;: My no deal brexit stock pile still holding strong
11/03/2020, 19:30 - David;: They had the UK bog roll boss out today saying it's all fine just don't be idiots
11/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: They've got massive extra capacity. Not a problem making more bog roll
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: How much more are people planning on shitting
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Rob;: They made the big roll for us. We'll be fine
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: Shit twice as fast and furiously in a crisis
11/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: Yeah - just buy that roll. More than a lifetimes shitting in that I'd imagine
11/03/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: You'd be annoyed if you got it installed on your giant holder the wrong way
11/03/2020, 19:33 - Stefan;: I love that this bog roll thing is clearly because of the no-deal Brexit threat last year, where it was one of the imported goods most at risk of shortages
11/03/2020, 19:33 - Stefan;: Because of customs checks
11/03/2020, 19:34 - Stefan;: And a viral epidemic has fuck all to with that
11/03/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: It's people anticipating being made to stay at home for two weeks though isn't it
11/03/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: Not being allowed to go out and buy big roll when they need a huge shit
11/03/2020, 19:34 - David;: 2 fucking weeks I don't even get through a whole roll in that
11/03/2020, 19:35 - David;: I always have a few rolls in anyway. The issue is these fly by the seat of your pants cunts going down to the wire with every roll
11/03/2020, 19:35 - David;: Then panicking
11/03/2020, 19:35 - David;: Feast to famine
11/03/2020, 19:37 - Stefan;: Yeah but there's definitely also an element of "looming crisis = bog roll shortages" in people's minds
11/03/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: There basically is just as much big roll as ever, and people are shitting at the same rate, it's just been unevenly distributed into the most panicky people's homes
11/03/2020, 19:40 - David;: Yep
11/03/2020, 19:41 - David;: Enforcing planing buying onto others. It's a prisoners dillema game in essence
11/03/2020, 19:41 - David;: The most rational outcome collectively doesn't correspond to the most rational outcome individually if there isn't co-ordination or information sharing
11/03/2020, 19:42 - Paul;: Shit big, shit quickly and shit fast
11/03/2020, 19:43 - Paul;: Quickly and fast a fundamental difference but of critical importance in the art of the shart
11/03/2020, 19:43 - David;: You can't shit at a sustained higher rate without eating more.v
11/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Don't do a Jack and give yourself diarrhea
11/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Eat less
11/03/2020, 19:44 - David;: Eat intensely spicy food exclusively
11/03/2020, 19:45 - Rob;: Just get yourself on an IV drip. No shit
11/03/2020, 20:24 - Damian Rumble: I am loving the thought of what Charlie booker would make of all this in "News Wipe" if he was still making that
11/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: The deliveroo advert with Slabhead et al is so shit
11/03/2020, 20:49 - David;: Gets worse every time I see it
11/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 20:56 - David;: I've only gone and bought this. Feels good to have.
11/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: A classic football. Place it in the same category of the late 90s mitre balls.
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Is that this seasons?
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: I‚Äôm not avin that orange spot.
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Poor design
11/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: Yeah this seasons prem ball
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Will bring back bad memories
11/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: I love the stripe. Best bit about it
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: That's why younintantly dislike it
11/03/2020, 20:59 - David;: Really clarifies the curl that has been put on a strike
11/03/2020, 20:59 - David;: Hence why they named it the Nike strike I assume
11/03/2020, 20:59 - David;: Rhymes as well
11/03/2020, 21:00 - David;: They've just pulled a blinder. Inset grooves to improve grip.
11/03/2020, 21:01 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 21:01 - Sam;: This is first season where they‚Äôre introduced a new design mid season. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm most annoyed about. The yellow was also crap this year
11/03/2020, 21:02 - David;: Watch a goal where the ball stays ball. This ball is great for that
11/03/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Ball stays ball
11/03/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Go dog go
11/03/2020, 21:04 - David;: Would love a heads and volleys on the common to put it through its paces
11/03/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: Ball stays ball
11/03/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: Brown Vs Brown
11/03/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: Gnome represents gnome
11/03/2020, 21:33 - David;: Famous football weekly phrase
11/03/2020, 21:33 - David;: Embarassing not to pick up on that
11/03/2020, 21:58 - Damian Rumble: Tasty bit of extra time
11/03/2020, 22:05 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 22:06 - Paul;: Best to just get rid? Let it go
11/03/2020, 22:08 - / James Ball: Actually grasping and letting go of things is particularly hard with my thumb in its current state
12/03/2020, 09:09 - Sam;: So the cobras are meeting today and announces we has delay phase?
12/03/2020, 09:10 - Rob;: If they don't do it now we've completely fucked it
12/03/2020, 09:10 - Jack G;: Nice little 2-3 weeks working from home then?
12/03/2020, 09:48 - Jack G;: I‚Äôve actually just been told to work from home from tomorrow on until COVID-19 has blown over
12/03/2020, 09:48 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm hoping for the same
12/03/2020, 09:49 - Jack G;: I think it will be government advice later to encourage it
12/03/2020, 09:51 - Rob;: We seem to be preparing for that.
12/03/2020, 09:53 - Rob;: Quite likely I wouldn't be able to unless they get me and about 20 other people quite a good MacBook. Could get some nice downtime out of it
12/03/2020, 10:10 - / James Ball: I'm not going to be able to work from home. I'm having jobs cancel now. Starting to look at a roughly ¬£2k loss of earnings over the next 3 weeks
12/03/2020, 10:10 - / James Ball: Rischi Rich's self employment help is too little too late
12/03/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 12:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Dat kebab
12/03/2020, 12:49 - Phill: Lol was kekking about this earlier
12/03/2020, 12:49 - Rob;: The perfect last line
12/03/2020, 13:04 - David;: Come on. PSA conference cancelled because of dat corona. Whole paper I don't have to write or present now.
12/03/2020, 13:05 - David;: The amount of switch time this makes room for üëèüèª
12/03/2020, 13:05 - Jack G;: Skyrim time?
12/03/2020, 13:05 - David;: Yeah yeah
12/03/2020, 13:05 - David;: Well probably stardew valley these days.
12/03/2020, 13:07 - David;: Or I could do some unfinished stuff on breath of the wild. Maybe solve the deku tree riddles.
12/03/2020, 13:09 - David;: This is just excellent. Best pandemic ever
12/03/2020, 15:02 - David;: Tom Hanks has coronavirus
12/03/2020, 15:02 - Jack G;: Old news
12/03/2020, 15:42 - Paul;: Trump Coronavirus incoming
12/03/2020, 15:45 - Rob;: 140 new cases today, up from 80 yesterday. Figures probably a week behind actual exposure. Those numbers are going to shoot up aren't they?
12/03/2020, 15:47 - Jack G;: Certainly. Looks like football will be cancelled pretty soon too. 3 Leicester players are currently being tested
12/03/2020, 15:58 - Damian Rumble: The cancelled the Australian GP as well. Madness to let that go ahead this week
12/03/2020, 15:59 - Phill: They should cancel GP permanently.
12/03/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: Lol
12/03/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: Catastrophic rim failure
12/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Euros off
12/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Stay.
12/03/2020, 16:47 - David;: Champs league as well likely
12/03/2020, 16:47 - David;: Put away the moon
12/03/2020, 16:48 - Jack G;: Liverpool just ahead of the trend purposely getting knocked out of the tourney
12/03/2020, 16:49 - David;: Just need to lock the prem down before it can be cancelled
12/03/2020, 16:50 - David;: Could stop Phil winning his first Jules Chippet title. Obviously couldn't possibly awarded without completing the season.
12/03/2020, 16:51 - Rob;: I suppose it can never be won before the final whistle on the final day as there's no points limit
12/03/2020, 16:52 - Rob;: Every player could get two hattricks
12/03/2020, 16:52 - Jack G;: Will be interesting to see what happens with relegation and euro qualification if the prem is cancelled.
12/03/2020, 16:53 - Rob;: Would be gutting for Leeds. Would kill my mate
12/03/2020, 16:56 - David;: Should apply the league positions at time of suspension
12/03/2020, 16:56 - David;: Should have won more games earlier in the season if relegated. Sorry.
12/03/2020, 16:56 - Jack G;: Lol
12/03/2020, 16:56 - Jack G;: Brutal
12/03/2020, 16:58 - Jack G;: Maybe some sort of playoff scenario in the summer?
12/03/2020, 17:07 - Paul;: At least 5-10k cases in U.K.
12/03/2020, 17:07 - Paul;: At bottom of sharp upward curve
12/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: Predicting 80% of population to be infected
12/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: <1% fatality rate
12/03/2020, 17:27 - Paul;: 500k deaths
12/03/2020, 17:27 - Paul;: *upper case estimate
12/03/2020, 17:29 - Jack G;: We‚Äôre fine
12/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: Won't happen. Only 3k dead in China
12/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: Much bigger population, hit earlier, less well prepared, less good healthcare system.
12/03/2020, 17:30 - Jack G;: Chances are I‚Äôve already had it
12/03/2020, 17:30 - Damian Rumble: Probably China are censoring the true figures though right
12/03/2020, 17:30 - Damian Rumble: Also China have a much more powerful state to shut down and quarantine society
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Jack G;: They were also trying to cover it up for 3 weeks and sacrificed one region for the rest of the country essentially
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Paul;: Built hospitals in 10 days
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Damian Rumble: USA fucked. Private healthcare plus shit employment laws. The survivors will be bankrupt
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah USA is fucked we can all agree there
12/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: USA too stupid to contain it
12/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: Will be doing all the wrong things constantly
12/03/2020, 17:33 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs more that people are used to avoiding medical assistant to avoid bankruptcy
12/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: We‚Äôre not containing it. Just staying away from old people
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Rob;: Yeah we're doing shit
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Paul;: Said we need some immunity in the population
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Rob;: But we'll do something once it gets quite bad
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Paul;: Just trying to push back the peak
12/03/2020, 17:35 - Rob;: That does make sense. When there's no cure or inoculation available, letting people get it slowly is your best option. We're just not really doing that very well
12/03/2020, 17:35 - Paul;: ‚ÄúControlled transmission‚Äù
12/03/2020, 17:36 - Jack G;: Yeah tbh there are only 3 ways to stop a virus. 1) Mass vaccination (not feasible for probably over a year) 2) Hurd immunity 3) everyone dies
12/03/2020, 17:36 - Jack G;: What‚Äôs the best option? Obviously 2
12/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: So you're confident you've already got it?
12/03/2020, 17:45 - Jack G;: Well I definitely had mild cold type symptoms for the last 2-3 days. So it‚Äôs 50/50 I guess whether it‚Äôs a standard cold or corona?
12/03/2020, 17:46 - Paul;: Yeah same here since returning from USA. But just feels like standard cold
12/03/2020, 17:46 - David;: Same
12/03/2020, 17:46 - Paul;: Anticipating standard cold
12/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: Ah
12/03/2020, 17:46 - David;: Very mild cold
12/03/2020, 17:47 - David;: I don't think I have corona
12/03/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: But jack definitely does
12/03/2020, 17:47 - David;: If it is then it's shit, I want my money back
12/03/2020, 17:47 - Jack G;: Exponential growth in the thread
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Yeah Just an annoying cold
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt be it
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Surely not
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: But suspiciously timed
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Damian Rumble: I had a pretty bad fever after coming back from Norway. And I did sit next a Chinese girl in a bus for 8 hours while I was there
12/03/2020, 17:48 - David;: Everyone is going to get psychosomatic illnesses from self-trolling
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Damian Rumble: Patient zero
12/03/2020, 17:48 - David;: Well you're fucked
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Damo definitely had it
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: But I'm fine now
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Coronavirus 101 is fever
12/03/2020, 17:49 - David;: It gets hard to know whether you're ill or not
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Plus Chinese
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: And only my two of my housemates and thier boyfriends caught it
12/03/2020, 17:50 - Stefan;: I've got the absolute classic cold symptoms - blocked nose and sore throat, feeling generally shit
12/03/2020, 17:50 - Stefan;: But no cough or fever
12/03/2020, 17:50 - Jack G;: The reverse placebo
12/03/2020, 17:51 - David;: So everyone already has corona
12/03/2020, 17:51 - Stefan;: So I'm good to go anywhere
12/03/2020, 17:51 - Paul;: Got this but doesn‚Äôt fit the fever, cough or shortness of breath
12/03/2020, 17:51 - David;: Same. No fever.
12/03/2020, 17:51 - David;: I do have a somewhat dry throat
12/03/2020, 17:52 - Jack G;: Yeah I also skipped fever but have everything else
12/03/2020, 17:52 - Paul;: Lol
12/03/2020, 17:52 - David;: You can't skip the fever
12/03/2020, 17:52 - David;: Fever is the main symptom
12/03/2020, 17:52 - David;: I think I don't have coronavirus.
12/03/2020, 17:52 - Paul;: Odds are you do
12/03/2020, 17:53 - David;: Nah
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Jack G;: I did wake up with a cold sweat though the other night
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: Hah
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: The fever
12/03/2020, 17:53 - David;: If there are 10,000. 1 in 600 people. Fancy my odds.
12/03/2020, 17:54 - David;: Ah here we go. Kept that rather quiet Jack.
12/03/2020, 17:55 - Jack G;: Well I wouldn‚Äôt class it as a fever. No shivering or raised temperature for more than a night
12/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Just a standard night waking up bolt upright in a cold sweat.
12/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Screaming
12/03/2020, 17:56 - Jack G;: But have you heard of a one night fever? Surely you can‚Äôt recover than quickly. Must have been in the mind
12/03/2020, 18:13 - Paul;: Jack you got ravaged by the virus
12/03/2020, 18:14 - Sam;: I‚Äôm tip top. Drawing strength from the panic.
12/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: Chaos is a ladder
12/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: You were born in the darkness. Moulded by it.
12/03/2020, 18:45 - Jack G;: You didn‚Äôt see coronavirus until you were already immune
12/03/2020, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: SEAGULLFORWARD
12/03/2020, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 19:17 - / James Ball: I also have recent cold like symptoms
12/03/2020, 19:18 - / James Ball: Slight cough, stuffy nose. No fever, generally feel fine
12/03/2020, 19:19 - Rob;: I've heard Corona doesn't do snot. Hamish is that true?
12/03/2020, 19:24 - Paul;: I‚Äôve had snot
12/03/2020, 19:24 - Paul;: But odd all to have hit a cold at the same time. Haven‚Äôt had a cold or anything in 3 years or so
12/03/2020, 19:25 - Phill: Yeah I've felt grotty. No snot. Slight cough.
12/03/2020, 19:25 - Phill: Plus my arse is in bits so the toilet paper has come in handy
12/03/2020, 19:26 - / James Ball: Most likely corvid candidate so far
12/03/2020, 19:29 - Phill: No explanation for the arse
12/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: Arse not a typical symptom?
12/03/2020, 19:51 - Phill: Don't think so
12/03/2020, 19:52 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 20:03 - Stefan;: Great chat on radio 6 just now from Mark Riley:
"We are all mindful of the fact that we're hearing on the news and we're just living in this world where there are coronaviruses. And it's a horrible and scary time, particularly for bands who are on the knife edge of making it work and making it pay."

Guest: "Um, well yeah, it's even more scary for people with respiratory problems"
12/03/2020, 20:21 - Paul;: Herd immunity is GOAT
12/03/2020, 21:25 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Thoughts on the glasto line up for you going?
12/03/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: None of us have tickets

12/03/2020, 22:14 - Damian Rumble: Just got a text from my boss. Apparently the CEO of BT has been tested positive for Coronavirus. No doubt shit will be hitting the fan tomorrow
12/03/2020, 22:50 - David;: Arteta
12/03/2020, 22:50 - David;: Corona
12/03/2020, 23:06 - Paul;: Maybe we have got it then. Seemingly everyone who feels a bit ill has it
12/03/2020, 23:06 - Paul;: Next
12/03/2020, 23:07 - David;: Nah this is fuck all
12/03/2020, 23:07 - David;: Just a sniffle
12/03/2020, 23:07 - David;: Everyone has made themselves ill psychologically
12/03/2020, 23:08 - Paul;: There is no virus
12/03/2020, 23:08 - David;: Yeah self-reinforcing cycle until everyone kills each other
12/03/2020, 23:09 - Paul;: Until everyone shits themselves to death through repeated hoarding of bog roll
12/03/2020, 23:12 - David;: Sell Arsenal players.
12/03/2020, 23:13 - David;: No chance that game will be played

13/03/2020, 07:46 - Rob;: Where does that asterisk go?
13/03/2020, 07:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Every cloud...

https://apple.news/AaSWp4D2zQiSPsPMr9k41vw
13/03/2020, 07:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Bog roll explained
13/03/2020, 07:56 - Damian Rumble: Lol
13/03/2020, 07:58 - Damian Rumble: Can someone explain how the premier League can continue? Four clubs and multiple players infected
13/03/2020, 07:58 - Jack G;: It won‚Äôt, they‚Äôre having an emergency meeting today
13/03/2020, 08:02 - Paul;: Liverpool unable to win
13/03/2020, 08:02 - Paul;: Void the season
13/03/2020, 08:03 - Rob;: Such a huge troll
13/03/2020, 08:04 - Paul;: It‚Äôs what‚Äôs going to happen
13/03/2020, 08:05 - Jack G;: Reset everything, start next season with the same teams across the board as if we were back in August 2019
13/03/2020, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah there would be something beautifully tragic about that
13/03/2020, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Would reaffirm what it is to be a liverpool fan
13/03/2020, 08:12 - Rob;: I think we'd hear more about it than if you were just allowed to win it
13/03/2020, 08:33 - Damian Rumble: Just sneezed. What a relief.
13/03/2020, 10:08 - Sam;: Well if the season is called off I just want to say thanks to klopp and the Liverpool team for granting the little Irish boys wish in his letter to klopp by loosing games and crashing out of the fa cup and Europe.
13/03/2020, 10:09 - Paul;: Liverpool can‚Äôt win the league
13/03/2020, 10:09 - Phill: Already won it. Next.
13/03/2020, 10:11 - Phill: If anything, winning it whilst having to adapt to both VAR and Covid is a bigger achievement than anything scrubchester United have done. They had the game on easy mode.
13/03/2020, 10:12 - Phill: We've had to do it with all of these content packs that the FA have purchased
13/03/2020, 10:12 - Rob;: Errrr. I see a _West_ Germany on the list, but I don't see a Germany
13/03/2020, 10:13 - Paul;: Scrubchester
13/03/2020, 10:21 - David;: Champions league ded
13/03/2020, 10:22 - Sam;: This logic.. üòÇ PEADOPOOL LOGIC
13/03/2020, 10:23 - Phill: Please explain what is illogical about it being more difficult to win the league whilst 1) adapting to a big change in the rules 2) unpredictable programme and suspension due a pandemic?
13/03/2020, 10:24 - Phill: Compared to DURRgerson just bribing the refs and not having any competition?
13/03/2020, 10:24 - Phill: Your argument is flawed.
13/03/2020, 10:26 - Sam;: Lol. Every team is adapting so PEADOPOOL not disadvantaged.

Then the virus disruption is only hitting the prem in the last two weeks. And again, every team is affected, not just PEADOPOOL
13/03/2020, 10:28 - Phill: And we also had to deal with the winter breaks. So many momentum disruptors. More difficult.
13/03/2020, 10:28 - David;: Sam. We're 25 points clear. Just hush now.
13/03/2020, 10:28 - Rob;: Ferguson did win 13 league titles
13/03/2020, 10:29 - Phill: He bribed the officials to buy extra time in games until they won.
13/03/2020, 10:29 - Sam;: So did every team
13/03/2020, 10:29 - Phill: What's your point? If you have a positive momentum and it is disrupted, it makes things harder.
13/03/2020, 10:30 - Phill: In the same way that it might stop any negative momentum for struggling teams. Making things easier.
13/03/2020, 10:32 - Phill: DURRgy time.
13/03/2020, 10:32 - Sam;: Firstly it was two weeks, after a gruelling festive period. All the teams were glad of it, especially klopp. You‚Äôre the first person to argue that the break was actually a negative. Classic PEADOPOOL nonsense
13/03/2020, 10:33 - Jack G;: I‚Äôm just sat here hoping not to get relegated
13/03/2020, 10:36 - Rob;: They might just have to start next season with the teams in the same leagues as they started in this season
13/03/2020, 10:37 - Paul;: Wouldn‚Äôt count as a win though
13/03/2020, 10:38 - Sam;: I think they‚Äôre hoping that they can‚Äôt postpone for a month. Euros is cancelled, then we can just have a June season end not May.
13/03/2020, 10:38 - Sam;: *can postpone
13/03/2020, 10:43 - Jack G;: So Europe slots just stay the same as for this season too?
13/03/2020, 10:44 - Rob;: Mindfield, but how else would you do it?
13/03/2020, 10:44 - Rob;: Minefield
13/03/2020, 10:46 - Jack G;: True. Let‚Äôs say it‚Äôs postponed 2-3 months, can you play the rest of the matches before next season starts? Probably not
13/03/2020, 10:47 - Jack G;: And how would transfer window work
13/03/2020, 10:51 - Sam;: I could only work if the postponement was only a month/ 6 weeks. So if everything could restart in May
13/03/2020, 10:56 - Sam;: But if the season can‚Äôt be finished it‚Äôs null and void. Nothing won, play off for relegation and Europe.
13/03/2020, 10:58 - Rob;: Liverpool Vs Norwich. Winner wins the title, loser relegated
13/03/2020, 10:58 - Jack G;: If someone gets relegated through playoffs when they‚Äôre not currently in the relegation zone they‚Äôll definitely be taking legal action against the league
13/03/2020, 11:00 - Hamish Sinclair: Liverpool not winning the league from Corona will only make them more talked about
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: In 50 years they'll be the kloppsby babes
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: The greatest team of all time to not win the league
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd actually prefer that to being handed the league before the end
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Sam;: A channel 5 documentary and everything
13/03/2020, 11:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Yea yeah, divock origi presenting
13/03/2020, 11:02 - Paul;: A dvd release available at garages across Merseyside
13/03/2020, 11:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Their legend will be so exaggerated, no one will remember that they actually were quite average in 75% of the games
13/03/2020, 11:03 - Sam;: I‚Äôm getting this post framed as Phil‚Äôs wedding present
13/03/2020, 11:04 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 11:36 - David;: Yeah just push Euros back a year, month suspension, then end season in late June
13/03/2020, 11:37 - David;: Would actually be better for all the players to pass it to each other deliberately now, so the squads work through it quickly and are immune for the April re-start
13/03/2020, 11:38 - Sam;: Yeah everyone is struggling to accept that we actually do need some level of infections to combat it
13/03/2020, 11:40 - David;: Well in the population as a whole it makes sense to smoothe it out but for a football squad with incredibly low risk elite athletes and world class medical facilities you want to spike that fucker up as quickly as possible
13/03/2020, 11:40 - Rob;: I want to get it. Get it over with
13/03/2020, 11:40 - Paul;: Everyone sniffling at work
13/03/2020, 11:40 - Paul;: Are they sure this isn‚Äôt it
13/03/2020, 11:41 - Paul;: I‚Äôm sure everyone‚Äôs got it and it‚Äôs mild
13/03/2020, 11:41 - Rob;: Please disease me
13/03/2020, 11:41 - David;: Sniffling not listed
13/03/2020, 11:41 - David;: I also have a sniffle.
13/03/2020, 11:42 - Jack G;: COVID party
13/03/2020, 11:42 - David;: I think this is the placebo sniffle
13/03/2020, 11:44 - David;: placebo sniffle - mid-90s grunge band
13/03/2020, 11:47 - Rob;: 100,000 people thought to have it in Ohio
13/03/2020, 11:49 - Rob;: Almost doubling the worldwide cases
13/03/2020, 11:50 - Jack G;: Any trump says Europe are doing a bad job of containing it
13/03/2020, 11:50 - Jack G;: And*

13/03/2020, 12:03 - Sam;: Even in a pandemic he can‚Äôt resist bullshitting and attacking people
13/03/2020, 12:05 - David;: Wearing the cap to the lab trip was my favourite
13/03/2020, 12:05 - David;: And then saying 'they couldn't believe how well I understood this' - with the experts standing next to him
13/03/2020, 12:10 - Rob;: Lol

13/03/2020, 12:18 - David;: Better version
13/03/2020, 12:19 - David;: While literally in the same press conference saying he had no idea anyone died of seasonal flu
13/03/2020, 13:16 - Paul;: Impossible to tell what‚Äôs placebo and what‚Äôs not anymore
13/03/2020, 13:19 - David;: I'm eating lots of vitamin C. Done.
13/03/2020, 13:24 - Paul;: Muscles starting to feel weaker
13/03/2020, 13:25 - Jack G;: Have you recently sneezed though?
13/03/2020, 13:25 - Paul;: Well that‚Äôs the issue. Sneezed earlier
13/03/2020, 13:27 - / James Ball: I'm continually wondering if I'm out of breath or just exhaling
13/03/2020, 13:28 - Paul;: Lol
13/03/2020, 13:28 - Paul;: That‚Äôs a great predicament
13/03/2020, 13:29 - / James Ball: No longer possible to discern regular breathing from coronavirus
13/03/2020, 13:30 - Paul;: Any fever yet?
13/03/2020, 13:32 - / James Ball: No longer possible to tell if it's cold outside or I'm cold
13/03/2020, 13:33 - / James Ball: Too much coronavirus in the air
13/03/2020, 13:33 - / James Ball: There's nothing for it, I'm going to have to start bottling my piss
13/03/2020, 13:36 - Paul;: I am starting to feel more flu like I think. But could just be a trick
13/03/2020, 13:36 - Paul;: What is real anymore
13/03/2020, 13:37 - Paul;: Better to stay at work and help build up the herd immunity
13/03/2020, 13:54 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-51870445
13/03/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: Feel fine now
13/03/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: Virus done
13/03/2020, 14:16 - David;: Yeah. Belt and braces.
13/03/2020, 14:19 - David;: Ah. We're up to 798 cases
13/03/2020, 14:20 - David;: 300 more in a day. Really got away from us
13/03/2020, 14:21 - Jack G;: Still fewer cases than Italy had deaths

13/03/2020, 15:10 - Rob;: You can have that
13/03/2020, 15:11 - Rob;: My best ever idea
13/03/2020, 15:21 - Damian Rumble: Shameless dropping promo for fox news into a serious discussion about what we should do to help prevent a Pandemic. Classic
13/03/2020, 16:47 - Paul;: Got a sore throat now
13/03/2020, 17:14 - Phill: Fine.
13/03/2020, 17:14 - Phill: Whoever topples it has to gump all the fingers
13/03/2020, 17:18 - Phill: Hamish, why is it that children are largely unaffected? Is there something about their immune system that differs from the adult population that doesnt make it spaz out? Would damping down people's immune response to the virus reduce the fatalities? Just give everyone low dose steroids?
13/03/2020, 17:33 - / James Ball: Cooked or frozen?
13/03/2020, 17:35 - Paul;: Full of virus. Spreading to the herd
13/03/2020, 17:55 - Rob;: That's the fun of it. You can play either way
13/03/2020, 17:58 - Hamish Sinclair: The people getting tested are:
1. Those travelling back from danger areas (less children)
2. People admitted in respiratory distress (affects old infirm people/immunosupressed)
3. Those who can pay for a private test
13/03/2020, 17:59 - Hamish Sinclair: There will be a huge number of people with the disease (including children) who may even develop mild symptoms, but wont be tested
13/03/2020, 18:00 - Hamish Sinclair: So children get it, but they are less likely to be put into respiratory failure, and therefore less likely to be tested
13/03/2020, 18:01 - Phill: What sort of immunosuppression we talking? Beccas immune system got blitzed 3 years ago. Would it repopulate to efficient levels in this time?
13/03/2020, 18:02 - Phill: Or is it continued immunosuppression - organ transplants, arthritis, cancer etc
13/03/2020, 18:03 - Phill: It just seems odd to me that that cause of the respiratory issues is an immune response, but seems to impact most on people with weak immune systems?
13/03/2020, 18:05 - Paul;: Agreed, joker is shit
13/03/2020, 18:05 - Paul;: But you can tell when it‚Äôs set
13/03/2020, 18:06 - Phill: Paul is your phone sending older messages again?
13/03/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: No, got round to watching to it. Replying to Sam from a few months back

13/03/2020, 18:19 - David;: Are you ready for it though?
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: I remember you and Phil saying you got high watching it
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Phill: Watched Laputa high as fuck a few weeks ago and it triggered a mental loop for a few days
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: Lol
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: What mental loop?!
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Rob;: I watched Castle in the sky the other week. Low on magic
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: Just repeated mental imagery of the robot blooting the army base
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Rob;: It's quite intense that one
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Rob;: Less wacky, more army

13/03/2020, 18:22 - Rob;: Would have been good if they'd turned to you and you just cried out PODSU PODSU PODSU
13/03/2020, 18:22 - David;: Wait Rob laputa is Castle in the sky?
13/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Then it's Hal's moving castle
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Paul;: Howl
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Rob;: Yeah it's called castle in the sky
13/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Yeah yeah
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Phill: >hal

13/03/2020, 18:23 - Paul;: Hal‚Äôs moving castle

13/03/2020, 18:25 - Rob;: Hal Robson-Kanu's floating canoe
13/03/2020, 18:25 - David;: Princess mononoke was fucking ridiculous. Watched that high had no idea what was going on at any point. Completely abstract
13/03/2020, 18:25 - Phill: GOAT
13/03/2020, 18:25 - Paul;: Have you watched porco rosso?
13/03/2020, 18:25 - Phill: Not yet
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: Need to watch it
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Paul;: It‚Äôs huge
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: >Netflix not having Grave of the Fireflies
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Paul;: Fighter ace pig in the 20‚Äôs. Couldn‚Äôt be bigger
13/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: The red turtle also worth watching while heavily blooted
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Rob;: Can't penetrate this sentence
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Paul;: That‚Äôs porco rosso
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Rob;: Is he a pig that's good at fighting?
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Paul;: Yeah

13/03/2020, 18:38 - Hamish Sinclair: She probably still has a good case to be working from home, presumably shes still under follow up?
13/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: Yeah her boss has said she can work from home, but guidance on this from an immune reconstitution pov seems to be difficult to find.
13/03/2020, 18:40 - Hamish Sinclair: I think in most cases the answer is "noone actually knows"
13/03/2020, 18:40 - Hamish Sinclair: She is proabbly at lower risk now than she was at the time, but still I think if you're at risk then best to just be at home
13/03/2020, 18:41 - Hamish Sinclair: As in not go to work, still leave the house
13/03/2020, 18:42 - David;: But that leaves you in December 2022 with your cock hanging out
13/03/2020, 18:44 - Phill: She says thanks for the advice. Decided to wfh indefinitely.
13/03/2020, 18:44 - Damian Rumble: Nah. Got little Oscar didn't it
13/03/2020, 18:44 - Paul;: It‚Äôs fucking shit and boring
13/03/2020, 18:45 - Phill: >liking GP. >Liking Joker.>living in London.
13/03/2020, 18:46 - Rob;: Joker was terrible
13/03/2020, 18:47 - Rob;: Phoenix was the only good thing about it
13/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Edinburgh airport ded
13/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Didn't see it. Won't see it. Next.
13/03/2020, 18:55 - Damian Rumble: I'm just a big fan of slow burn psychological thrillers
13/03/2020, 18:57 - Paul;: >incel
13/03/2020, 19:00 - Paul;: You‚Äôve all seen spirited away I presume?
13/03/2020, 19:00 - Rob;: Of course
13/03/2020, 19:03 - / James Ball: Naturally
13/03/2020, 19:15 - Damian Rumble: I haven't actually but eagerly waiting it's arrival on Netflix
13/03/2020, 19:25 - Phill: <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 19:26 - Damian Rumble: What is this?
13/03/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: Looks like David Bowie mate
13/03/2020, 19:31 - Damian Rumble: But why?
13/03/2020, 19:31 - Damian Rumble: Have I missed out on a vital part of meme culture?
13/03/2020, 19:32 - Damian Rumble: Has once again my total lack of knowledge about popular culture let me down?
13/03/2020, 19:46 - Paul;: Have any of you seen annihilation or mother?
13/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: I didn't really like Annihilation
13/03/2020, 19:48 - Paul;: The shimmer though. A lovely holiday to the shimmer
13/03/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: The atmosphere was godo
13/03/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: Just seemed fairly silly
13/03/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: It's directed by Alex Garland who wrote the Beach isn't it?
13/03/2020, 19:50 - Rob;: I really like Ex Machina, he did that too
13/03/2020, 19:59 - Stefan;: Yeah Ex Machina was superb
13/03/2020, 20:00 - Jack G;: Has a great soundtrack too, really puts you on edge

13/03/2020, 20:06 - Phill: Might bed into the castlevania anime on Netflix
13/03/2020, 20:06 - Paul;: Yeah that‚Äôs good. Well first season was
13/03/2020, 20:12 - / James Ball: I've got no internet on the new house yet. Would love to get grotty to Netflix but not net to flix
13/03/2020, 20:15 - Damian Rumble: Annihilation was awful. Mother was decent but it was classic case of Netflix stealing concepts from more successful films
13/03/2020, 21:42 - Phill: Pedo Rosso
14/03/2020, 09:29 - Damian Rumble: One of the upsides of the pandemic is that it is now super easy to get gig tickets. Sarah and I are going to see orbital at printworks tonight and we got second hand tickets online for a 1/3 of the price.
14/03/2020, 09:30 - Paul;: Leverage the pandemic
14/03/2020, 09:30 - Paul;: What else can we get on the cheap apart from bog roll
14/03/2020, 09:36 - Jack G;: Flights are pretty cheap atm
14/03/2020, 09:36 - Jack G;: Also corona beer appears to be half price in my local Asda
14/03/2020, 09:40 - Paul;: Got to buy that
14/03/2020, 09:42 - Phill: Classic liberal elite not giving a fuck about anyone else and ignoring advice.
14/03/2020, 09:42 - Damian Rumble: What advice was that?
14/03/2020, 09:53 - Phill: I presume printworks is inside and you'll be in close quarters with lots of other people.
14/03/2020, 09:53 - Phill: The reason they've not banned large public events outdoors is to avoid people reverting to small indoor gatherings.
14/03/2020, 09:54 - Phill: Pubs etc
14/03/2020, 09:55 - / James Ball: The advice to minimise non essential contact with other people
14/03/2020, 09:57 - Damian Rumble: Try enforcing that in literally any city haha
14/03/2020, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Think the whole thing relies on people being responsible
14/03/2020, 10:00 - Rob;: It is on the government to ban events like that if they want absolutely no one to go though
14/03/2020, 10:01 - Paul;: Need to spread to the herd as well
14/03/2020, 10:01 - Rob;: Not saying it's a great idea to go, but if it's been allowed to go ahead some people are going to go
14/03/2020, 10:18 - / James Ball: My coronavirus has died down a lot today. Big sneezing, almost no cough, breathing normal
14/03/2020, 10:19 - Rob;: Sneezing is the kiss of life
14/03/2020, 10:19 - Rob;: The jpeg told us so
14/03/2020, 10:19 - / James Ball: The sweet kiss of sneeze

14/03/2020, 10:21 - Rob;: They told us there wasn't diarrhea

14/03/2020, 10:30 - Rob;: Apparently that's what all the kids at my housemates school have been saying
14/03/2020, 10:30 - Rob;: Accepted knowledge among teenagers

14/03/2020, 10:34 - Rob;: I would have said it was _unknown_

14/03/2020, 10:58 - Paul;: Soon we‚Äôll be crying out for our quarantine. Playing a psychological game delaying it
14/03/2020, 10:59 - / James Ball: A lovely bit of quarantine would do us good. Reconnect with nature
14/03/2020, 11:00 - Paul;: Rather than being reluctantly forced into it
14/03/2020, 11:19 - Phill: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 12:26 - Damian Rumble: So I take it you will be quarantining yourself and not going to the pub for the next month?
14/03/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: Will be enforced quarantine coming in soon
14/03/2020, 12:27 - Phill: Yes?
14/03/2020, 12:58 - Paul;: Lol woman irate at Waitrose help desk that there was no bog roll
14/03/2020, 13:15 - / James Ball: My work has nearly all been cancelled up to April currently. I'll be bedding in at home and not going out
14/03/2020, 13:15 - / James Ball: Storing my piss in bottles as previously discussed
14/03/2020, 13:16 - Paul;: Yeah best to keep the piss well stocked
14/03/2020, 13:30 - / James Ball: Already quite gouty today with steak and two bottles of red last night

14/03/2020, 16:18 - Paul;: All sold out?
14/03/2020, 16:19 - Paul;: How much supply on average were people buying?
14/03/2020, 16:21 - Rob;: Yeah I haven't seen loo role in the shops since Tuesday
14/03/2020, 16:21 - Paul;: Lol mythical bog roll
14/03/2020, 16:22 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt wait to get home and use an entire roll in one shit out of decadence
14/03/2020, 16:22 - Hamish Sinclair: It's the only way
14/03/2020, 16:22 - Hamish Sinclair: You never know when you may need it again
14/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: And it saves you buying bottle water
14/03/2020, 16:24 - David;: Plus an analytic/diagnostic function. Essential monitoring data
14/03/2020, 16:30 - / James Ball: Vital must maintain a full piss log
14/03/2020, 16:31 - / James Ball: Also lemons. No lemons anywhere
14/03/2020, 16:32 - Paul;: What measurement you taking?
14/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: Temperature, viscosity, specific gravity

14/03/2020, 16:42 - / James Ball: I'm already stocked
14/03/2020, 16:44 - / James Ball: I saw my neighbours get an Amazon delivery of probably 64 rolls earlier
14/03/2020, 16:44 - Paul;: No taste test?
14/03/2020, 17:01 - / James Ball: Maybe a little sip. Whet my whistle with a quick piss test

14/03/2020, 17:50 - Paul;: Yeah the panic
14/03/2020, 17:50 - Paul;: Of course the USA can‚Äôt handle it
14/03/2020, 20:34 - David;: Wouldn't predict that
14/03/2020, 20:35 - David;: Completely non-essential. Even a g and t is viable without them. Always a nice to have.
14/03/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: People making honey lemon?
14/03/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: Their vitamin c after tablets ran out?
14/03/2020, 20:55 - Rob;: Could just be an unrelated shortage. A thing I've learned doing stuff for Tesco is that at any one time there are two or three extremely common items that are out of stock nationally
14/03/2020, 20:55 - Rob;: Probably more noticeable at a time like this
14/03/2020, 21:31 - / James Ball: I just wanted to make a lemon chicken roast tomorrow.

14/03/2020, 21:40 - Paul;: >not taking your own daily stool sample for investigation
14/03/2020, 21:40 - Rob;: First question on an exam paper once. Where is the mode accurate place to take body temperature and what temperature should it read
14/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: - anus

14/03/2020, 22:06 - Paul;: Aspirational
14/03/2020, 22:13 - / James Ball: Ex girlfriend used to share a house with a neckbeard. His room just smelt of shit and cigs. He only drank red bull and basically only ate ready meals or takeaway. Worked at an estate agent, ginger, fat. Bed had brown stain in it where he slept and never changed the sheets
14/03/2020, 22:13 - / James Ball: No bed covers, just raw duvet
14/03/2020, 22:14 - Paul;: On raw mattress?
14/03/2020, 22:15 - / James Ball: Nah, a white sheet that was grey from sweat

15/03/2020, 09:10 - Paul;: Real virus on its way

15/03/2020, 09:46 - Phill: Yeah just aggravate your airways by pissing on some bleach and inhaling the fumes
15/03/2020, 09:47 - Phill: Death rate under 60 something like 0.2%

15/03/2020, 10:48 - / James Ball: Fever quite high up the list
15/03/2020, 10:56 - David;: No they were chatting shit all along
15/03/2020, 10:56 - David;: Fake news
15/03/2020, 10:57 - Jack G;: Majority of evidence of symptoms gathered presumably from people more seriously affected
15/03/2020, 10:58 - Paul;: Good point
15/03/2020, 10:58 - / James Ball: False conclusions drawn from biased datasets

15/03/2020, 11:19 - Rob;: Starting to look like a sewing machine accident more than a brush with a threshing machine
15/03/2020, 11:24 - / James Ball: Yeah, although my GP surgery may soon stop doing non urgent appointments so I'm facing potentially taking out my own stitches next weekend
15/03/2020, 11:26 - Rob;: Just assimilate them instead
15/03/2020, 11:43 - Rob;: Excellent visualisations and simulations in this

15/03/2020, 13:06 - Rob;: Think I'm going to wfh as far as that's possible as a precaution. They've asked us to stay home if you get anything even slightly related

15/03/2020, 13:21 - / James Ball: Rob and Phil both gone

15/03/2020, 13:25 - / James Ball: This
15/03/2020, 13:27 - / James Ball: Special or slightly unusual pasta easily found still.

15/03/2020, 15:36 - Stefan;: Got some chest tightness, but feels like it's general anxiety
15/03/2020, 15:37 - Stefan;: A massive self-troll

15/03/2020, 18:18 - Paul;: Any symptom developments yet?
15/03/2020, 19:47 - Paul;: How is Italy getting wrecked so hard. Do they have terrible infrastructure? Always kissing to say hello? Big catholic‚Äôs so lots of old people in church?
15/03/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: Their healthcare has been rated quite highly
15/03/2020, 20:29 - Sam;: Shit response. They fucked up the containment phase so had to go to full lock down to try and manage the peak.
15/03/2020, 22:23 - David;: Everyone full lock down now. France and Spain as well
15/03/2020, 23:13 - / James Ball: nah nah nah, blighty fine. the blue passports will protect us

16/03/2020, 08:45 - Paul;: Definitely just a case of breathing out
16/03/2020, 08:46 - Rob;: Maybe that's all this epidemic is. Just a few thousand people breathing out
16/03/2020, 08:49 - Stefan;: No fever though?
16/03/2020, 08:50 - / James Ball: just one big communal sigh

16/03/2020, 09:07 - David;: Quite a boring apocalypse. Everyone just staying home with a mild cough. No sport on.
16/03/2020, 09:09 - David;: All I have is a sore throat. Very slight runny nose. Pretty sure it can't be corona

16/03/2020, 09:25 - David;: Yes
16/03/2020, 09:26 - David;: Lol the work email fallout is brutal.
16/03/2020, 09:27 - David;: The panic as every lecturer in our department tries to move to remote teaching at one days notice.
16/03/2020, 09:27 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 09:27 - David;: Mostly old people with retarded grasp of basic IT
16/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: they're destined for death anyway
16/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: wouldn't worry about it
16/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: extrapolating the chinese death rate to the whole uk we would only lose 2.8m people
16/03/2020, 09:32 - Rob;: Only just over five times the yearly number of deaths
16/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: a very minor quintupling of the death rate. nothing to worry about. go back to bed.
16/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: But if we match their infection rate/million to our population it's fuck all
16/03/2020, 09:33 - Damian Rumble: Most of them brexit voters anyway
16/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: Only 80,000 people infected in a 1.4bn population
16/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: yeah but the chinese contained it much better
16/03/2020, 09:34 - / James Ball: death rate seems a better metric
16/03/2020, 09:34 - / James Ball: assume everyone in the uk gets infected
16/03/2020, 09:35 - David;: Plus older population do death rate will be higher here

16/03/2020, 11:07 - Rob;: Does that make them the most affected country per 1000 people
16/03/2020, 11:08 - Sam;: San Marino is having a bit of a shocker. Iceland doing very well.
16/03/2020, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: 0.3% of the entire San Marino population have had Coronavirus
16/03/2020, 11:09 - Sam;: Brazil loving
16/03/2020, 11:10 - Sam;: it
16/03/2020, 11:10 - Damian Rumble: Compared to 0.002% of the UK
16/03/2020, 11:15 - / James Ball: would love a quick holiday to Greenland now. just wait it all out in Nuuk
16/03/2020, 11:18 - Damian Rumble: Or more likely bring the virus over to them and wipe out their civilization. Just like the good old days
16/03/2020, 11:19 - / James Ball: nah nah, no virus here
16/03/2020, 11:47 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 12:04 - Damian Rumble: That's northerners for you
16/03/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: Rob how‚Äôs your virus?
16/03/2020, 12:27 - Rob;: Still cough and tight chest, no fever
16/03/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: What‚Äôs your temperature at?
16/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: No thermometer, but feels regular
16/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: My finer in my anus feels no warmer than it normally does in there
16/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: *finger
16/03/2020, 12:29 - / James Ball: thermometers sold out in boots yesterday
16/03/2020, 12:29 - / James Ball: everyone desperate to get those anal temps
16/03/2020, 12:30 - Paul;: >not permanently leaving a thermometer in the anus and getting second by second readings via Bluetooth
16/03/2020, 12:32 - Damian Rumble: Question. Is it acceptable to steal big roll from work, given the shortages?
16/03/2020, 12:33 - Stefan;: Damo have you tried literally any corner shop in London?
16/03/2020, 12:33 - Stefan;: Gold mines of bog roll
16/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Yeah, and it's often organic and gluten free too
16/03/2020, 13:05 - Paul;: Are they sure this ongoing runny nose and grot isn‚Äôt the virus
16/03/2020, 13:20 - David;: Would be good if bog roll becomes our currency unit
16/03/2020, 13:25 - David;: No. Latest research has brought everything we know into doubt
16/03/2020, 13:25 - David;: My grass suggestion isn't going to look so ridiculous in a bit is it. People can just thank me when it does come in handy
16/03/2020, 13:35 - Damian Rumble: Wanna buy this bitcoin? Nah mate I'm only interested in bogcoin...
16/03/2020, 13:36 - Paul;: Rob fever update?
16/03/2020, 13:41 - Rob;: You've got to stop Paul
16/03/2020, 13:42 - Rob;: Unless the fever dream is just you asking if I have a fever over and over
16/03/2020, 13:52 - David;: I think I may as well start wiping with grass now just to become acclimatised to it
16/03/2020, 13:52 - David;: So it isnt a shock when the inevitable happens
16/03/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: Doc leaves the best leaf
16/03/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: Absorbent, moisturising
16/03/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: I tried with an oak leaf once. Too rough
16/03/2020, 14:33 - Jack G;: Surely just only shit directly before a planned shower, no need for anything
16/03/2020, 14:34 - Rob;: Pampass grass the best grass
16/03/2020, 14:37 - / James Ball: No showers in the woods Jack
16/03/2020, 14:42 - David;: How much co-ordination will this take though. Have you ever drunk coffee Jack? The effects are instantaneous and devestating. Impossible to wait until a shower.
16/03/2020, 14:45 - Jack G;: Lol how much are you shitting? No control over your sphincter?
16/03/2020, 14:46 - / James Ball: I was walking in the woods last year near my house. Sudden urge to shit. No choice but to drop trou behind an oak tree
16/03/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: Remind me not to meet you for a coffee Dave
16/03/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: I had to do one in the woods before the reservoir in Wales
16/03/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: Luckily I had tissues on me
16/03/2020, 14:51 - David;: You can't tell me you haven't experienced the purge Carnage of coffee?
16/03/2020, 14:51 - David;: *pure
16/03/2020, 14:51 - David;: Unbelievably loud and incredibly close.
16/03/2020, 14:52 - David;: When it hits there's no negotiation
16/03/2020, 14:53 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs definitely speeding up the need to shit but I‚Äôm not wearing an adult nappy to cafe Nero, easily manageable
16/03/2020, 14:54 - David;: Well yeah they have toilets. So you're always safe. But you have 5-10 minutes maximum to evacuate your anus after a morning coffee
16/03/2020, 14:56 - Rob;: So if I brought a flask of very strong coffee on a hike through completely barren wildneress with Fay and all our partners there and put you under huge social pressure to drink it, you'd be completely fucked?
16/03/2020, 14:57 - Hamish Sinclair: No
16/03/2020, 14:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Self isolation for symptoms only, not contacts
16/03/2020, 15:03 - Paul;: Guy at work just messaged in to say he has fever and cough
16/03/2020, 15:08 - / James Ball: I've had a whole cafetiere this morning. Diarrhoea no where to be found
16/03/2020, 15:08 - / James Ball: Ah. That's it. Death imminent
16/03/2020, 15:10 - Paul;: Everywhere else we‚Äôd be quarantining but have to wait for symptoms
16/03/2020, 15:12 - Jack G;: We‚Äôll have the strongest herd though
16/03/2020, 15:13 - Paul;: Could go touch stuff on his desk
16/03/2020, 15:14 - / James Ball: Give it a lick
16/03/2020, 15:21 - David;: Could go either way. But there's huge risk there. Especially if it was a morning hike.
16/03/2020, 15:23 - David;: If it was in the morning and I'd just had breakfast then there's just no chance of weathering that.
16/03/2020, 15:30 - Jack G;: Are you not just drinking coffee that‚Äôs way too strong Dave? Try something milder
16/03/2020, 15:34 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 15:46 - David;: Paul can tell you about coffee
16/03/2020, 15:47 - David;: This is well established
16/03/2020, 15:47 - David;: Even Derek knows
16/03/2020, 15:51 - Paul;: Yeah yeah. Fires up the bowels to produce slurry
16/03/2020, 15:51 - Paul;: Was telling Sam on Saturday how a guy evacuated the cubicle next to me as I had to deal with the coffee effects
16/03/2020, 15:52 - David;: It was so catastrophic that you forced him out?
16/03/2020, 15:52 - Paul;: Yeah it was awful
16/03/2020, 15:52 - David;: I like the story of the phantom desperate shitter in your office
16/03/2020, 15:53 - David;: Always leaving it right down to the wire
16/03/2020, 15:53 - Paul;: Lol he‚Äôs disappeared since the cleaners outed the shitter
16/03/2020, 16:04 - Paul;: Now the paranoia creeps in. 2 people out with symptoms
16/03/2020, 16:06 - David;: Ah you're definitely fucked then
16/03/2020, 16:07 - Paul;: But the herd will save me r...right...
16/03/2020, 16:07 - David;: When public health England are saying it will last till next spring what's that based on? There will just be a few grotty cases clinging on still
16/03/2020, 16:08 - Paul;: How‚Äôs your arsehole how‚Äôs your fever
16/03/2020, 16:08 - David;: Or full blown rim failure still
16/03/2020, 16:10 - David;: I'm a little covid short and stout. How's your arsehole how's your gout?
16/03/2020, 16:18 - Rob;: I think it's based on the idea that the measures we take and the affects of summer will give us some respite in the summer, without having particularly conferred immunity on enough of the worldwide population
16/03/2020, 16:19 - Rob;: Spanish flu did a similar thing, got itself in in three waves of varying severity
16/03/2020, 16:19 - Rob;: Apparently resistance isn't always long lasting with corona viruses
16/03/2020, 16:25 - Jack G;: But hopefully when it mutates it will become weaker though right? Easier to fight off
16/03/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: I don't think you want it to mutate at all
16/03/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: That would wipe out any immunity we have built up
16/03/2020, 16:27 - Jack G;: But isn‚Äôt a little mutation just standard? Inevitable when it comes up against an organism with immunity. Otherwise we‚Äôd never get colds again
16/03/2020, 16:28 - Rob;: And possibly render our vaccines and antivirals useless
16/03/2020, 16:28 - Rob;: Well colds and flu are seasonal because they mutate a lot
16/03/2020, 16:28 - Rob;: Things like small pox were successfully wiped out before they could mutate
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Jack G;: This is the same brand of virus as the cold so surely we can antipasti it will mutate similarly
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Jack G;: >antipasti
16/03/2020, 16:31 - Rob;: Yeah, it's the same class as some strains of cold, not all
16/03/2020, 16:32 - Rob;: It could be a hard one to get rid of, but I don't think that's very easy to predict
16/03/2020, 16:51 - Sam;: Big update in progress
16/03/2020, 16:51 - Sam;: Get bbc news on
16/03/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: The signing lady definitely making much more blow job-like motions than usual
16/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Everyone working from home
16/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Don't go to pubs or restaurants
16/03/2020, 17:02 - Paul;: Rob you‚Äôre locked in for 14 days now
16/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: No mass gatherings

16/03/2020, 17:03 - Jack G;: How many is classed as a mass gathering though?
16/03/2020, 17:03 - Jack G;: No one ever says
16/03/2020, 17:03 - David;: Anything that needs emergency services
16/03/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: So not schools
16/03/2020, 17:04 - Damian Rumble: Going to see book of Mormon this evening. Just managed to squeeze it in in time

16/03/2020, 17:13 - David;: That's the biggest problem here
16/03/2020, 17:13 - David;: No river dancw
16/03/2020, 17:14 - Rob;: This is such a wonderful comment
16/03/2020, 17:14 - Rob;: I hope this is what get preserved for the museums in centuries timw
16/03/2020, 17:27 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: See the switch there ready and waiting
16/03/2020, 17:33 - Rob;: Yeah, begging for me
16/03/2020, 17:33 - Rob;: Asking after me
16/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: Gris
16/03/2020, 17:34 - David;: It's the video game experience of the century
16/03/2020, 17:36 - Sam;: Toothpaste, Vaseline and bog roll at the desk. Suspect in combination
16/03/2020, 17:36 - Rob;: Yeah that looks bad
16/03/2020, 17:37 - Jack G;: Vaseline. No explanation
16/03/2020, 17:37 - Sam;: Sore lips? (Or nob)
16/03/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: Thanks to the vaseline, neither is sore
16/03/2020, 17:48 - Rob;: Quite weasily to 'not support' mass gatherings and to 'reccomend against' going to pubs etc without closing them
16/03/2020, 17:48 - Rob;: Advice but not action
16/03/2020, 17:49 - Rob;: Quite a lot of room for people to flout that
16/03/2020, 17:49 - Rob;: And for companies to try keep people coming so not to go under
16/03/2020, 17:51 - Hamish Sinclair: In the space of today the answer to this has changed to a yes if she has symptoms
16/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Yeah. Think this is because if they formally close then they have to compensate
16/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: This way they can say 'well you were still open. We'd just told all your customers not to go'
16/03/2020, 19:01 - / James Ball: Ah. Time to bed in for 14 days then
16/03/2020, 19:18 - Damian Rumble: Ah... Book of Mormon cancelled due to virus.
16/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Oh no Damian. Looks like you‚Äôre being forced into isolation
16/03/2020, 19:24 - Damian Rumble: Well... We are currently isolating in an Irish pub so could be in worse places
16/03/2020, 19:28 - Rob;: Ok superspreader
16/03/2020, 19:37 - / James Ball: Damian taking no responsibility for his actions
16/03/2020, 19:38 - Damian Rumble: We are basically the only people in here
16/03/2020, 19:38 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 19:38 - Rob;: That would be ironic if the density of flat shares became higher than in pubs
16/03/2020, 19:39 - Phill: Damo, I'm glad you find this funny and don't seem to give a fuck about anyone else.
16/03/2020, 19:44 - Damian Rumble: I'm also going into work tomorrow. Though that is mainly to cycle in and pick up my laptop to go home afterwards
16/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Big theatres should look to sell livestreaming  to Netflix etc. Small theatres fucked, but I'd like to watch starlight express without trousers on without fear of persecution for once in my life
16/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Pubs could also livestream the grot in case anyone's interested
16/03/2020, 19:45 - Rob;: I would watch a stream of the people still frequenting the King's arms
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Paul;: Stream of the kebab van
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: Would pay
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: Imagine if it had been broadcasting the moment I hit it
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: Super bowel level audiences for that
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Paul;: I missed that
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Jack G;: Coming in hot
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Rob;: Ah lol. Bowel
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Paul;: Bowel

16/03/2020, 20:02 - Phill: No symptoms. Been running. 10k. Lungs fine. Working from home indefinitely.
16/03/2020, 20:03 - Rob;: Still the same. Shortness of breath, mild cough and no fever. Doesn't really fit the symptoms so I reckon I'm fine. But working from home for the foreseeable
16/03/2020, 20:04 - / James Ball: No symptoms, isolating as a household. no work
16/03/2020, 20:27 - David;: So everything's a bit fucked
16/03/2020, 20:27 - Paul;: Lol please elaborate
16/03/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: Interesting time to experience
16/03/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: Couldn‚Äôt have predicted this
16/03/2020, 20:29 - / James Ball: certainly the biggest societal thing to happen in our lifetimes so far
16/03/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: Since ww2?
16/03/2020, 20:30 - / James Ball: likely yes in terms of social upheaval
16/03/2020, 20:35 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: The corner shop gold mine
16/03/2020, 20:36 - Phill: Corner shop GOAT

16/03/2020, 20:37 - Paul;: Huge day
16/03/2020, 20:37 - David;: Yeah just in general. A general take on the situation
16/03/2020, 20:38 - David;: Ironic that we had the blitz moment the brexiteers were craving but had nothing to do with brexit.
16/03/2020, 20:47 - David;: I have a feeling the whole thing will be viewed as a massive over-reaction in retrospect
16/03/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: Yeah a bit of cold
16/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: I'd like to dig up some of the early reports back in January
16/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: How minor it seemed.
16/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: Less important than Megxit
16/03/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: Lol yeah no one was paying attention to it. I was following it but didn‚Äôt expect it to blow up this much
16/03/2020, 20:54 - / James Ball: we're deep in the corona hole now
16/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: It‚Äôs just big news. A big event
16/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: A bumper news event
16/03/2020, 20:57 - / James Ball: how much toilet paper are people stocking

16/03/2020, 20:58 - Phill: This is the kind of shit I thirst for. It directly impacts me but I still love the suspense.
16/03/2020, 20:58 - Phill: The chaos.
16/03/2020, 20:58 - Paul;: Yeah it makes it interesting
16/03/2020, 20:58 - Phill: Just tuning in from home now
16/03/2020, 20:59 - Paul;: The paradigm shift
16/03/2020, 20:59 - / James Ball: it is good to observe the chaos. I actually have time to watch it and engage for once
16/03/2020, 21:00 - / James Ball: tee

16/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: >reading books
16/03/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Lol
16/03/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Surely this is a good time
16/03/2020, 21:09 - / James Ball: just opened my account with the milk man. I'm just going to sit back and have him bring me all the crisis supplies I need
16/03/2020, 21:09 - Phill: Milk AND bottles to piss in
16/03/2020, 21:10 - / James Ball: win win. just converting the milk straight to piss whilst sapping it of its vital calcium
16/03/2020, 21:10 - Phill: Cloudy to clear

16/03/2020, 21:15 - Paul;: You ruined our supply chains
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Jack G;: Not really. Just bought one pack of 24. Pretty normal
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: Fair enough for the man who's been eating fibre to try and bing himself up
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: I've never seen a 24 pack
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: Jack, that's bigger than you
16/03/2020, 21:16 - / James Ball: jack's 29 is extreme
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: No one buys a regular 24 pack of bog roll
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: >normal
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: >24
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Phill: Only ever buy a small 4 pack every week/fortnight

16/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Ah
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Jack G;: Well I heard rumours of the bog roll massacre a week ago so bought a 24 pack instead of a 9 pack. Not like I took every roll of toilet paper in the shop
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Had 5
16/03/2020, 21:18 - Jack G;: Just sensible

16/03/2020, 21:20 - David;: Borderline wholesale
16/03/2020, 21:20 - Phill: In all honesty my anus will probably thank me for not brutalising it twice a day with a vigorous wiping
16/03/2020, 21:21 - Phill: Just a gentle rinse rather than dry threshing
16/03/2020, 21:21 - / James Ball: the dry thresh
16/03/2020, 21:21 - / James Ball: can't have that
16/03/2020, 21:21 - / James Ball: we also have some moist wipes. not a fan myself. but good as an anal salve

16/03/2020, 21:25 - Phill: Cases will rise. Deaths will spike. Markets will continue to crumble. A child will die.
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Do you think they‚Äôll put us in for the big 12 weeker
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Already getting us prepped
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: They'd never announce 12 weeks from the off
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: Bad for markets
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Over 70s they were readying for 12 weeks
16/03/2020, 21:27 - Rob;: Fine. Contribute nothing anyway
16/03/2020, 21:27 - David;: I can't get over the 24 pack. Do they even make those? Meant for large scale events surely
16/03/2020, 21:27 - Paul;: Like a shit party?
16/03/2020, 21:27 - Phill: MS is a 12 week condition so Becca is completely isolated now.

17/03/2020, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: I probably dont have the best experience of low level covid, cos all we are seeing is the fucked up lungs
17/03/2020, 10:48 - Phill: How many cases are you seeing?

17/03/2020, 10:56 - / James Ball: As bad or worse than flu? Is pneumonia just far more likely with covid-19?
17/03/2020, 11:44 - Rob;: How are all the famous people with no symptoms getting tested for corona virus?
17/03/2020, 11:44 - Rob;: Are private healthcare firms testing?
17/03/2020, 11:44 - Paul;: Think so
17/03/2020, 11:45 - Rob;: Surely that reveals it's much more widespread than official figures
17/03/2020, 11:45 - Jack G;: Best to just assume everyone has it at this point

17/03/2020, 11:58 - / James Ball: Yeah temporary shortage at best
17/03/2020, 11:58 - Rob;: Yeah, as long as we don't go total lock down food will keep getting grown and manufactured
17/03/2020, 11:59 - Rob;: I guess the European lock downs could potentially disrupt supply chains unless that's been specifically legislated against?
17/03/2020, 12:00 - Paul;: Yeah they‚Äôre keeping goods moving
17/03/2020, 12:00 - Rob;: Maybe this is just life now

17/03/2020, 13:00 - Sam;: nah. covid has happened because the chinese are detty pigs.
17/03/2020, 13:01 - Rob;: This is a very good argument for veganism
17/03/2020, 13:01 - Rob;: Most epidemics or pandemics have origins in animal farming
17/03/2020, 13:02 - Paul;: Farming the pangolin
17/03/2020, 13:02 - Phill: Or top secret government labs

17/03/2020, 14:03 - Phill: Yeah
17/03/2020, 14:04 - Phill: They just emerge in a few months and everyone is dead

17/03/2020, 14:25 - Paul;: The classic froust
17/03/2020, 14:25 - Paul;: Our bodies would rot before the covid got us
17/03/2020, 14:53 - David;: I feel ravaged after 3 days of wales. Far worse than a flu.
17/03/2020, 14:53 - David;: So extrapolate that to 3 months.

17/03/2020, 14:54 - Rob;: I don't imagine the vulnerable groups will be caning the nos balloons, Mandy, LSD and ket quite so harf

17/03/2020, 15:45 - David;: Almost 2,000 cases now
17/03/2020, 15:58 - Jack G;: 2150 deaths in Italy. That‚Äôs mental
17/03/2020, 16:21 - David;: All quite fucked
17/03/2020, 16:22 - David;: But then chief scientific advisor says cases could peak in 2 weeks.
17/03/2020, 16:22 - David;: How does that fit with the 12 month prediction?
17/03/2020, 16:22 - Paul;: 2 week peak would be fine
17/03/2020, 16:22 - David;: Everyone's flailing around essentially.
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: Peaking for now? Before summer camps it down a bit?
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: Lol
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: Damps it down
17/03/2020, 16:23 - David;: Just camp that down
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: I wouldn't say it was an overly camp virus
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Stefan;: Lol, currently the virus is massively camping it up
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Paul;: put a camp on it. i've always said that
17/03/2020, 16:24 - David;: Virus starts making people talk like Graham Norton
17/03/2020, 16:24 - David;: Reduces the intensity
17/03/2020, 16:24 - Stefan;: Billions of tiny Dale Wintons infecting us all
17/03/2020, 16:25 - David;: So it's 2 weeks but 18 months. Wut?
17/03/2020, 16:25 - David;: Think it will blow over in a few days.
17/03/2020, 16:26 - David;: This will all look very embarassing
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Stefan;: I thought he said it'll take 2-3 weeks just to tell how well the current measures are working
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: Seasonal winter 19/20 peak, then a summer trough, then perhaps a winter 20/21 peak
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Paul;: need a good storm to bed into whilst working from home. that would improve the situation
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Stefan;: Because of lag time in infections causing symptoms and then people getting tested
17/03/2020, 16:26 - David;: Nah think that was saying of measures work the cases will start reducing in 2 weeks
17/03/2020, 16:27 - Stefan;: Number of confirmed new daily cases will start reducing, yeah
17/03/2020, 16:27 - Rob;: Lol. Andrex have dropped their coupon in the May issue of the mag. Took them this long to realise they didn't need to discount to sell more
17/03/2020, 16:28 - David;: Yeah. So it's actually fuck all.
17/03/2020, 16:28 - David;: 2 weeks then eases off. Why then is everything shit down for months
17/03/2020, 16:28 - David;: They've johnned it quite hard
17/03/2020, 16:30 - Rob;: But if unquarentine you're just back to where we were the other day, unless there's no one left in the UK who has it and flights remain grounded
17/03/2020, 16:33 - Paul;: Asked if the new coronavirus measures could be in place for 18 months, the government‚Äôs chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance told the Health Select Committee he doesn't know.

However he said they are likely to last for months, ‚Äúcertainly not a couple of weeks‚Äù.

He told MPs the UK is "nowhere near ready" to be talking about releasing the measures.

"When we have got to the stage where we can keep the outbreak below NHS capacity and keep it there, that‚Äôs the time when can talk about releasing it," he said.

"It is going to be data driven," he added.
17/03/2020, 16:34 - Damian Rumble: I reckon give it a month or two of everyone being on edge working at home and then we'll all get fed up and will be all the more willing to get back to normal and sucking up having to deal with a the mild cold of everyone getting it.
17/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: and all our parents dying
17/03/2020, 16:34 - Sam;: You cretin
17/03/2020, 16:34 - Paul;: damian cannot grasp these kind of things
17/03/2020, 16:39 - Damian Rumble: If Brexit proved anything is that people quickly get tired of endless uncertainty and will swallow just about anything that allows them to get back to thier lives with the minimal inconvenience to themselves, and with little thoughts to everyone else.
17/03/2020, 16:40 - Paul;: lol this is a virus damian
17/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: ‚ÄúTogether you should expect those to have a very significant effect on the peak and we should start to see the rates come down in two or three weeks‚Äô time,‚Äù he told the committee.
17/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Next.
17/03/2020, 16:40 - / James Ball: let's just get on with our lives and buy shares in funeral businesses
17/03/2020, 16:42 - David;: 20,000 deaths predicted, vs 8,000 from normal seasonal flu every year. So it's basically a bad case of seasonal flu
17/03/2020, 16:43 - / James Ball: just massively overwhelming capacity
17/03/2020, 16:44 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 16:44 - David;: Ordered in some light reading
17/03/2020, 16:44 - / James Ball: > #1 Best Seller

17/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: currently facing a ¬£6000 loss now in what was shaping up to be a bumper year
17/03/2020, 17:10 - Rob;: The gov have to compensate at some point. There will be so many points this affects
17/03/2020, 17:10 - Rob;: And long-term this will fuck a lot of full-time employees too
17/03/2020, 17:17 - Rob;: 10k cash grants for small businesses
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: No mention of sole traders
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Damian Rumble: Going to be a mean recession after all this forsure
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: 15% of GDP stimulus package
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: backing everything
17/03/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: Would be funny if the idiots get their blitz spirit moment but all it brings us is far left socialism level of spending and rendering Brexit irrelevant
17/03/2020, 17:25 - Stefan;: All these idiots who didn't live through the blitz and think it means carrying on exactly as normal
17/03/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 17:29 - Paul;: https://youtu.be/nc8uqDnl4wc
17/03/2020, 17:29 - Paul;: these types of people
17/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: cash grants don't have to be repaid
17/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: ¬£10k to tide you over there James
17/03/2020, 17:36 - / James Ball: 10K is realistically what I'll be looking at as a shortfall soon
17/03/2020, 17:39 - Sam;: Was rishi referring to the self employed as well or just ‚Äòbusiness‚Äô
17/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: technically once you are self employed you are a business
17/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: ltd company would be the next step up
17/03/2020, 17:41 - Sam;: üëçüèª
17/03/2020, 17:41 - Jack G;: Ball Ball & Ball Ltd
17/03/2020, 17:55 - Rob;: How many rolls left now Jack?
17/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: might end up with money directly in our accounts from the gov
17/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: a cheeky ¬£1k. bunce
17/03/2020, 17:59 - Jack G;: Is this mortgage holiday excluding interest as well? No point not paying if interest will just rack up
17/03/2020, 18:01 - Rob;: Just 1k for everyone?
17/03/2020, 18:01 - Paul;: something like that. What they're going to do in USA and already did in Hong Kong
17/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: direct payments to get people through
17/03/2020, 18:02 - Rob;: So ¬£67 billion?
17/03/2020, 18:02 - / James Ball: pocket change
17/03/2020, 18:02 - Rob;: Some idiots will really waste that
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Jack G;: How is it paid out though? Seems like a logistical nightmare
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Rob;: Hi many loo rolls is ¬£1000?
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Phill: They don't find it that hard when they want your tax
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Paul;: NI #? Electoral roll and cheques sent out or something
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: this is only me theorising
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: Still at 31, used less than a quarter of a roll today
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: just your normal everyday 24 roll purchase
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: i hope you're happy that you're responsible for the panic
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Phill: Alex Salmond must be loving the Covid smokescreen
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: You said 29 yesterday. You didn't go out even more did you?
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Jack G;: I must have miscounted
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Paul;: so much roll can't even count it properly
17/03/2020, 18:06 - Rob;: Keeping it in a huge vault like scrooge mcduck
17/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: A quarter of a roll in a single day? This is absurd
17/03/2020, 18:07 - Jack G;: Less than a quarter Dave. And that‚Äôs two people
17/03/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: so you have at least 4 months supply
17/03/2020, 18:08 - Rob;: Jack don't spend your thousand on more roll
17/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: But the fact you can even say you're approaching a quarter per day
17/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: We use maybe a roll every week or two
17/03/2020, 18:10 - David;: Lot of paper in a roll
17/03/2020, 18:10 - Jack G;: How though if you‚Äôre shitting every 30 minutes from drinking coffee? Are you one wipe and done every time?
17/03/2020, 18:10 - Sam;: What‚Äôs the usual sheets per roll?
17/03/2020, 18:10 - Rob;: I think we use 2 a week between 3. Used to be 1 roll a week when it was only men
17/03/2020, 18:11 - Paul;: lol
17/03/2020, 18:11 - Rob;: Yeah Dave, anecdotally you shit a lot more than you seem to wipe
17/03/2020, 18:11 - Rob;: Old Cyril Smear
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Phill: Wheres this grotty grand come from?
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Phill: Complete bollocks
17/03/2020, 18:12 - David;: a) my office bears the brunt of the coffee shots; b) that's one short sharp shit per day, then shit once more per day at most on average
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: Yeah, the presence of women will throw out your consumption rates
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Paul;: that was my prediction of what could come next
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Jack G;: But that office bog roll will need to be transferred to your house once quarantine sets in
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Rob;: You just can't shake a pair of flaps
17/03/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Would be better to pump ¬£68bn into SME cash flow so they can keep paying their staff than to just give every fucker a grand
17/03/2020, 18:14 - David;: Isn't that just a much less direct way of achieving the same thing?
17/03/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: yeah, it might pay to be more direct in this situation
17/03/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: calm panic etc
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Phill: No, what 5 year olds need a grand? And also, a grand won't cover my expenses. So I'd rather have my salary.
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Paul;: you still get your salary
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Paul;: everyone in hong kong got $10k HK dollars
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Phill: Not if I lose my job because my company doesn't have cash to pay people
17/03/2020, 18:16 - / James Ball: this sounds pretty much like my experience
17/03/2020, 18:17 - Jack G;: New hearthstone expansion then, might have to re-download for quarantine
17/03/2020, 18:17 - Paul;: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/its-time-for-free-money-from-washington-190321406.html
17/03/2020, 18:18 - David;: Lol they obviously wo t give it to 5 year olds. How many 5 year olds have an NI number and bank account?
17/03/2020, 18:19 - Damian Rumble: Loving how after literally a decade of saying can't borrow our way out of a difficult situation, the Tories have just borrowed 15% of GDP in a single day to do exactly that. 

Not saying that I am critical of the move, but you have to admire the incredible hipocracy on show
17/03/2020, 18:19 - David;: Plus yeah you still get your salary. A supplement not a replacement otherwise that would be a pay cut for most people
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: My point is people have different financial needs. Take two people who lose their jobs because their companies have no cash flow. One has monthly outgoings of ¬£1k the other lives in Kent and has a ¬£2k mortgage.
17/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: The point of this measure would be to catch people not on standard pay rolls like James.
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Paul;: too difficult to identify the needy - just give to everyone
17/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: There are additional measures to support business cash flow
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: Fine, give it to them, and then keep the other business afloat
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: Like what.
17/03/2020, 18:21 - David;: All the loans and tax relief they just announced?
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Jack G;: So is this 1k for all actually happening or is it fake news?
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Phill: Our payroll is ¬£120k per month, and we are already talking about laying people off.
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Paul;: fake but just a hypothesis
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Phill: Not enough in reality. Tax relief does not equal liquidity.
17/03/2020, 18:23 - Rob;: I love how seriously we're debating Paul invented measure
17/03/2020, 18:23 - / James Ball: this. I'm in a different industry but cash flow is vital in my sector too
17/03/2020, 18:24 - David;: But there are also grants and loans
17/03/2020, 18:24 - Phill: 10k - 25k
17/03/2020, 18:24 - Phill: Enough for a week
17/03/2020, 18:24 - David;: The US may do this, and it's been suggested by a lot of people here. Not just DePaul uk
17/03/2020, 18:25 - Paul;: ¬£5m loans for SME companies with no interest for at least 6months
17/03/2020, 18:25 - David;: Yeah lol. Very much not 25k
17/03/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: still crippling though. needs to be grants if you want companies to survive
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: Oops
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Jack G;: It makes no sense. I agree with a Phil it‚Äôs a pointless solution that most people will just spend on rubbish. Need to pump money into the system to keep businesses paying staff and out severe penalties in place for any bollocks where businesses are avoiding paying staff etc
17/03/2020, 18:27 - Phill: A ¬£5m loan is bollocks as it will cripple low margin industries for years
17/03/2020, 18:27 - David;: They are doing that as well Jack.
17/03/2020, 18:28 - David;: Also why do you assume people would spend a 1000k grant on rubbish bit not their wage packet?
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51932403
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Paul;: 5 minutes ago!
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Jack G;: >cheques
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Phill: Because I know most of my staff in London run out of money every month because they spend it on coke?
17/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: So pay them less wages. They're just spending it on rubbish.
17/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: Unecessary
17/03/2020, 18:29 - Phill: But give them a grand. Ok Karl.
17/03/2020, 18:30 - David;: Lol the illogic. Can't reason with that
17/03/2020, 18:30 - Jack G;: >Tracking people‚Äôs spend and giving the a pay cut because they spend money on anything leisurely
17/03/2020, 18:31 - Paul;: jack are you on both sides of the argument?!
17/03/2020, 18:32 - Jack G;: No I‚Äôm just pointing out how ridiculous it is to pay people less money based on what they spend it on
17/03/2020, 18:32 - David;: Lol but you are using that exact logic to oppose the 1k
17/03/2020, 18:32 - Paul;: but that was your entire point against the ¬£1k
17/03/2020, 18:33 - Jack G;: No I‚Äôm against the ¬£1k because people will spend it on crap. But you‚Äôre saying if that‚Äôs the case then they shouldn‚Äôt be paid that money in the first place. Very draconian
17/03/2020, 18:35 - David;: No I'm pointing out there is no difference between 1k in wage support or 1k in grant in terms of the demand it generates and the liquidity it creates
17/03/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: wages = spend on coke (supported by grant) - ¬£1k from government = spend it on coke
17/03/2020, 18:37 - Paul;: peoples behaviour will be the same
17/03/2020, 18:37 - Phill: A 1k grant to individuals creates no liquidity for businesses.
17/03/2020, 18:37 - Phill: Nor does tax relief
17/03/2020, 18:38 - Phill: Nor does a huge loan at an unspecified interest rate after 6 months foster any sort of sustainability
17/03/2020, 18:38 - David;: We need people to spend money on 'crap' because that crap is generally businesses, that employ people and pay other businesses.
17/03/2020, 18:38 - Paul;: if you witheld cash now it would be much worse
17/03/2020, 18:38 - David;: The second 2 do exactly that. The first does so indirectly
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: How does tax relief create cash?
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: It just means you pay less cash.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: You're not given cash.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: It's cash that is not leaving your bank account.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Paul;: keeps cash on the balance sheet
17/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: Hence you have more cash
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: Lol so deluded.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: Lol
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: So many companies have cashflow issues at the moment
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 18:40 - David;: So Phil somebody says you dont have to pay any bills or mortgage this months. That leaves with no more cash at the end of the month?
17/03/2020, 18:41 - David;: Hence the loans and grants. You seem unable to grasp that there are multiple different measures to do different things.
17/03/2020, 18:41 - Phill: Again, grants are up to 25k and a loan is a loan. Repayable.
17/03/2020, 18:41 - / James Ball: I would rather not take anything than take a loan
17/03/2020, 18:42 - Phill: You seem to live in some sort of fantasy land
17/03/2020, 18:42 - / James Ball: I'd just have to take some other work instead
17/03/2020, 18:42 - / James Ball: loan would be too destructive
17/03/2020, 18:43 - Phill: Tax relief is a reduction in outgoings, not a sustaining of income.
17/03/2020, 18:45 - David;: Paying no tax helps you cover other costs, including your wage bill.
17/03/2020, 18:45 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 18:47 - David;: Yeah, hence a grant would be more appropriate for you. OR, direct income support to get you through the next couple of months. That's why you have different measures. A sole trader has different requirements to an SME, that has different requirements to a ftse 250 company etc. etc.
17/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: What's illogical is saying 'im a full time employee of a medium sized company, hence all government support should be given in a form that most directly benefits me'
17/03/2020, 18:49 - Rob;: This has been fucking brilliant btw
17/03/2020, 18:49 - Sam;: Yeah, STFU Phil. üñïüèª
17/03/2020, 18:50 - Sam;: Everyone happy to have an update from southcombe garage yeah?
17/03/2020, 18:50 - Rob;: Yeah thank Christ
17/03/2020, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: Ok, I agree that needs are different, but tax burden is also different, yet they are applying a one size fits all tax relief programme?
17/03/2020, 19:21 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Lol in other news just received this. Killed me
17/03/2020, 19:22 - Phill: As an example - construction company with turnover of ¬£10m and pre tax profit of ¬£3m. Said company also factors into their cash flow a tax rebate for r&d. The company has very high costs, staff, vehicles, materials, suppliers to pay. The tax relief is not likely to sustain said company for any length of time. Whereas pumping bunce into it, based on employee number, rather than "chucking everyone a grand" will do much more
17/03/2020, 19:23 - Phill: ¬£3m should read ¬£0.3m
17/03/2020, 19:24 - Phill: Said company also takes out a loan of ¬£1m. Company pays back 100k for 10years plus interest. It's not a good position for low margin industries. Construction, retail, hospitality.
17/03/2020, 19:26 - Phill: A large insurance company, with high profit margin and low costs, with a high tax burden - sure
17/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: Yeah I see the point. But what they are facing is a very severe but temporary loss of revenue. So there it would seem logical to have enforced unpaid leave or temporary staff layoffs - as being done by airlines - rather than indiscriminately wanging all companies cash. The problem that creates is for the workers, which the income support would offset. Alternatively you keep them in work doing nothing and potentially having to work from home. But that's much less direct, and it has uneven effects on competition - e.g. some companies in a better cash position might use it to start a price war and gain market share or something. And as an additional benefit to the cash grant you would get a general demand stimulus across the entire economy, which also helps businesses
17/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: Thanks SgtDavid
17/03/2020, 19:54 - Phill: Agreed, but the collapse of a supply chain would not be a temporary loss of revenue. It would be long term and many contracts in an order book, which has been used to plan, goes out the window. We will see how this plays out but I would bet on loads of the big construction companies completely collapsing, and with them their supply chains.
17/03/2020, 20:04 - David;: Yeah. I doubt it, for big companies like that I imagine the government  will negotiate specific deals or restructure loans to have such a long repayment window to be essentially free money.
17/03/2020, 20:05 - David;: But yeah I mean it's a shit show companies will go bust. A few companies going busy would not be a bad thing as they are likely the shitest run and others will mop up their market share and expand.
17/03/2020, 20:05 - David;: *bust
17/03/2020, 20:06 - Rob;: Thanks SgtDavid
17/03/2020, 20:06 - David;: Part of the problem with QE after the financial crisis was it kept shit companies going to ease unemployment. The long term consequence was shite productivity which were still living with
17/03/2020, 20:06 - Damian Rumble: Jesus how is this conversation about Paul's claim that everyone is getting a grand still going on lol
17/03/2020, 20:06 - Paul;: You wait till we get that grand
17/03/2020, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: Yes. Great. Then James will be 9k short of what he could have earnt rather than 10k
17/03/2020, 20:09 - David;: You down the pub then Damo?
17/03/2020, 20:09 - David;: Licking the door handles
17/03/2020, 20:09 - Rob;: Playing spin the bottle down an old people's home
17/03/2020, 20:15 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: How many football clubs could go under from this?
17/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: Could be mental
17/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: Wreck the league pyramid potentially
17/03/2020, 20:22 - David;: Would be good if it led to mad promotions - forest green up to the prem
17/03/2020, 20:22 - / James Ball: Charlbury Town FC gone
17/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: Oh Nick don't go
17/03/2020, 20:23 - Paul;: Ducklington going under
17/03/2020, 20:24 - David;: Burst the 20 year football bubble. Maybe they'll all go back to being plumbers. Born and raised in the town
17/03/2020, 20:24 - Rob;: While Messi and Ronaldo are getting 80K a day to do keepie uppies from home
17/03/2020, 20:25 - Paul;: Billionaire owners might sell up
17/03/2020, 20:25 - David;: They'll have to retire. No one left to pay their wages
17/03/2020, 20:25 - Paul;: City back to grotting about
17/03/2020, 20:26 - Rob;: I'll buy a club with my grand
17/03/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: Pitch together
17/03/2020, 20:30 - / James Ball: do a real life fantasy football
17/03/2020, 20:30 - / James Ball: football much more interesting when it's held in bloodthirsty underground arenas
17/03/2020, 20:32 - Paul;: According to that imperial report we will only get restrictions 2/3 of the time then get the rest of the time to go mental before putting restrictions back on
17/03/2020, 20:33 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 20:38 - / James Ball: they're the wild weeks
17/03/2020, 20:38 - / James Ball: full anarchy for a few weeks then back to lock down
17/03/2020, 20:40 - Stefan;: Isn't the problem that everyone will have a fucking mad one, thereby spreading the virus twice as fast compared to a regular Friday night out
17/03/2020, 20:40 - Paul;: Nah. Get dat herd immunity
17/03/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: Plus majority will already have had it
17/03/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: Dat initial peak
17/03/2020, 20:42 - David;: Lol, from famine to feast. Gorging on transmission while we get the chance
17/03/2020, 20:42 - Phill: Herd immunity is supposed to generated via vaccine, not infection lol
17/03/2020, 20:43 - Stefan;: Yeah and if it's kept at a rate that's sustainable for NHS to cope with, it'll take years before enough of the population is immune
17/03/2020, 20:43 - Stefan;: And that's assuming infection does confer long lasting immunity
17/03/2020, 20:44 - Phill: Why does it take so long to get a fucking vaccine?
17/03/2020, 20:44 - Phill: Surely we can just print vaccines now we can sequester DNA?
17/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: Increase NHS alongside though so shortens the time
17/03/2020, 20:46 - Rob;: Safety and efficacy trials mostly
17/03/2020, 20:47 - Rob;: A lot of that can be sped up surely
17/03/2020, 20:48 - Rob;: Standard testing for all medicine involves multiple trials starting with small trials of uncomplex organisms, then working up through bigger groups of more complex things before arriving at human trials
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: They already started human trials yesterday
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: But vaccines are in principle relatively simple compared to a drug
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: Skipped all those stages
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: Yeah, I imagine they don't give much of a shit at this point
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: Also probably the worst outcome is you give someone corona
17/03/2020, 20:50 - David;: Would be good if they stumble on a great vaccine really quickly but comes with terrible side effects.
17/03/2020, 20:50 - David;: It also acts as an intense and instant laxative
17/03/2020, 20:50 - Paul;: That‚Äôs coffee
17/03/2020, 20:50 - Paul;: Already exists
17/03/2020, 20:51 - David;: But coffee doesn't vaccinate against covid-19 as far as I'm aware
17/03/2020, 20:51 - David;: If it does I'm fine
17/03/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: Hard to see why a vaccine would do that, should just be a key protein from the virus's surface
17/03/2020, 20:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Has to be given on the toilet
17/03/2020, 20:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Perhaps the delivery mechanism
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Covid free or long term laxative. That‚Äôs your options
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Rob;: 'they accidentally isolated the SHIT protein'
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Ruins your guts for a year
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Forced to isolate anyway due to explosive shitting
17/03/2020, 20:52 - David;: Has complex higher level emergent effects that no one could model. But makes you shit yourself
17/03/2020, 20:54 - David;: Yeah so we get herd immunity but accompanied by herd incontinence
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Our ward today ran out of masks
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Rob;: Fuck
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: The bog roll now seems petty
17/03/2020, 20:54 - David;: Ah. You'd think masks would be a minimum
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: The rules in the hospital change daily but normally because of supply issues rather than evidence based practice
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: Lol the herd incontinence
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Everyone got fit tested for these big one use only hazmat suits, and then the hospital instantly ran out of them
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: Are you seeing a lot more admissions to icu?
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Yesterday we had 56 people with suspected covid
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Today 90
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: All pneumonia?
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Lots of negative tests aswell though
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: Ah
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: So regular seasonal stuff intermingled
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Stefan;: Are you testing everyone with pneumonia symtoms? And what's the turnaround time?
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Could catch covid in the meantime
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Turn around for testing was up to a week last week
17/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: Are there enough tests even?
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: A double hit
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Which is why they stopped testing I the community
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Have flu already then catch covid
17/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Sp now you only get tested if you need admission
17/03/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: by which time you could be symptomless or dead I suppose
17/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: What's the demographic spread that you see in the hospitals with it?
17/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: If you go to a&e with the symptoms but dont need admitting then you are told to self isolate but not tested
17/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: All older?
17/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: We havnt seen alot of positive yet so hard to judge
17/03/2020, 21:00 - Hamish Sinclair: On an average day you would still expect a fair few admission with pneumonia, it's just now they are all concentrated in one place
17/03/2020, 21:01 - Stefan;: 1,950 positive tests out of more than 50,000 nationally
17/03/2020, 21:02 - Hamish Sinclair: I've not seen alot of young people, but I dont work on intensive care
17/03/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: Are you having to work much longer shifts?
17/03/2020, 21:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Not yet
17/03/2020, 21:03 - Stefan;: Do you think they should shift some of the testing capacity to frontline staff, rather than patients? Or does that just require way more capacity than we have
17/03/2020, 21:04 - Hamish Sinclair: But they anticipate that 50% of the work force will have to isolate in the next 4 weeks
17/03/2020, 21:04 - Hamish Sinclair: So that will likely change
17/03/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: The working from home and social distancing will surely have a positive effect
17/03/2020, 21:06 - Rob;: I've probably had a few hundred fewer interactions already, at population level that's huge
17/03/2020, 21:06 - Paul;: Yeah massive
17/03/2020, 21:06 - / James Ball: problem is the relatively long incubation though?
17/03/2020, 21:06 - / James Ball: people already infected waiting for it to burst out of the chest
17/03/2020, 21:06 - Paul;: Lol
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: That‚Äôs why they‚Äôll do a mandatory quarantine
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Rob;: Yeah, so we'll suffer for a week or two with the outcome of the last couple of weeks of unfettered mixing
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: I feel better now than I have done in a week and a half
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: Like the grot is ebbing away
17/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: The persistent cold disappearing
17/03/2020, 21:08 - / James Ball: yeah I'm feeling good apart from the threshing accident on the thumb
17/03/2020, 21:08 - / James Ball: even that's pretty good now
17/03/2020, 21:08 - / James Ball: the grot skin has been shed
17/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Need that test to see if you‚Äôve already had covid
17/03/2020, 21:10 - Hamish Sinclair: At present the biggest obstruction to fflow through the hospital is people awaiting results for "suspected" covid
17/03/2020, 21:11 - Hamish Sinclair: So the priority is to spend up in hospital testing to move people along
17/03/2020, 21:11 - / James Ball: could they be told to go home and act as if they are infected until they get results
17/03/2020, 21:11 - / James Ball: or are we talking people in need of immediate care
17/03/2020, 21:11 - Hamish Sinclair: The policy of not testing is  actually fucking us over massively as it's very easy to just tell someone to self isolate, but potentially dangerous If they then have to miss radiotherapy/chemo
17/03/2020, 21:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Only people unwell enough to need admission are tested
17/03/2020, 21:12 - Hamish Sinclair: This is what's happening
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Hamish Sinclair: New kitchen knives?
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Rob;: Exactly
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Phill: Stoned and I blew on the picture to try and clot it
17/03/2020, 21:14 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Your gif folder must be so well indexed

17/03/2020, 21:16 - / James Ball: yeah, looks gnarly enough though. at least yours was a clean cut. One of the reasons I needed 7 stitches was because it was such a jagged cut
17/03/2020, 21:16 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:17 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:18 - Rob;: It got very wobbly. I just showed it to a doctor in the pub rather than going in. They said it might be fine, and they were right. Did seem to be dying for maybe 48 hrs
17/03/2020, 21:21 - David;: Ah. That's fucked. Sliced a good quarter through there.
17/03/2020, 21:22 - David;: I can report my toenail has just now returned to normal. So a good 7 month re-growth period
17/03/2020, 21:22 - / James Ball: ah, we needed weekly updates
17/03/2020, 21:22 - / James Ball: the full 7 month regrowth as a gif
17/03/2020, 21:23 - / James Ball: I don't have any pictures of mine unsewn up but it was basically half way through my thumb - palm side to knuckle side
17/03/2020, 21:24 - / James Ball: I held it up immediately after it happened and could see through my thumb
17/03/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: Ah
17/03/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: No
17/03/2020, 21:25 - David;: Hit bone?
17/03/2020, 21:25 - David;: Bone saves all
17/03/2020, 21:25 - David;: The classic backstop
17/03/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: plausible. I think it didn't quite as it missed the tendon
17/03/2020, 21:28 - Rob;: The tendon saved me
17/03/2020, 21:28 - / James Ball: essentially it went in at the thumbtip and then runs down the palm side to the first knuckle
17/03/2020, 21:29 - Rob;: Tendon Rodgers
17/03/2020, 21:29 - / James Ball: about 20mm along the thumb and about 10mm into it
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: Burglars will be fucked
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: I hope the gov has thought about them
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Phill: No
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: Everyone in
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Phill: Because we're all getting a grand
17/03/2020, 21:37 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:38 - David;: Dem gifs
17/03/2020, 21:39 - Paul;: Everyone gets a grand
17/03/2020, 21:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Paul's fucking grand. The theory that launched a thousand arguments
17/03/2020, 21:41 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:42 - Sam;: Mnuchin says they‚Äôll give a grand out on a means tested basis
17/03/2020, 21:43 - Phill: Hamish are you/NHS doing any weird experimental shit in ICU? Like fiddling around with pressures and tidal volumes on the ventilator to see if anything works?
17/03/2020, 21:43 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:44 - Phill: Like now they seem to have discovered don't take ibuprofen (fake news probably plugged by the paracetamol market)
17/03/2020, 21:44 - Sam;: My old chin broke. Here‚Äôs Mnuchin.
17/03/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: Very good
17/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:45 - Sam;: Dave, all of those are funny for the audio not the visual. You goon
17/03/2020, 21:45 - Paul;: Yeah get no audio from them
17/03/2020, 21:46 - David;: They are audio-visual clips. I get the full audio
17/03/2020, 21:46 - Sam;: Anyone else?
17/03/2020, 21:47 - Phill: Yeah full audio here
17/03/2020, 21:47 - Phill: You two probably own iPhones
17/03/2020, 21:47 - David;: There you go. Get a proper device.
17/03/2020, 21:48 - David;: You are staring down the barrell of an mp4 file. Nothing more elaborate than that
17/03/2020, 21:49 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:49 - David;: Lol that particular reaction
17/03/2020, 21:50 - Sam;: The gulp
17/03/2020, 21:53 - Rob;: This will always be in my heart
17/03/2020, 21:56 - Sam;: Gin and tonic is so fucking good
17/03/2020, 21:56 - David;: Yeah
17/03/2020, 21:57 - David;: It really takes an edge off
17/03/2020, 21:57 - Sam;: I can really feel why they thought it had restorative properties. Just tastes like it cutting through the issue. Some issue.
17/03/2020, 21:58 - David;: An unspecified issue is really being dealt with
17/03/2020, 21:58 - David;: That'll be the quinine there boi
17/03/2020, 21:58 - Sam;: Yeah yeah. Just don‚Äôt question anything. Dat quinine
17/03/2020, 21:59 - Phill: Maybe quinine has anti Covid as well as anti malarial properties
17/03/2020, 22:01 - / James Ball: back on the red tonight. french. beaujolais
17/03/2020, 22:01 - Phill: Really need to panic buy some wine
17/03/2020, 22:02 - / James Ball: my dad has panic bought flour for his bread making. 28Kgs
17/03/2020, 22:02 - / James Ball: wine always good, drinking through my stash of nice gift wine
17/03/2020, 22:02 - Sam;: Lol. Laura was in Tesco yesterday. Most people panic buying the usual. One woman just had 12 bottles of wine. Nothing else
17/03/2020, 22:03 - Paul;: Flours all sold out
17/03/2020, 22:03 - / James Ball: direct from the mill
17/03/2020, 22:03 - Paul;: Derek‚Äôs been stocking up as well
17/03/2020, 22:04 - David;: Judith says in chippy there is fresh stuff but nothing dry in Aldi but no fresh stuff and loads of staples in co-op
17/03/2020, 22:04 - David;: Not sure how that's happened
17/03/2020, 22:05 - David;: Sold out of exactly opposite categories of food
17/03/2020, 22:06 - Sam;: No one likes the fresh stuff in also. Closer to end of life, that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs cheaper.
17/03/2020, 22:06 - Sam;: Goes off quicker
17/03/2020, 22:06 - / James Ball: my dad said no meat but fish in co-op today
17/03/2020, 22:07 - David;: Fake news. Their avocados take fucking forever to ripen
17/03/2020, 22:07 - / James Ball: Lidl best of both worlds. superior to aldi
17/03/2020, 22:07 - Paul;: That‚Äôs the opposite of what you want from an avacado. They do opposite foods
17/03/2020, 22:08 - David;: Ah well yeah I shop at Lidl.
17/03/2020, 22:08 - David;: Maybe it's completely different
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Sam;: Lol. Apart from the avocados. Their ripening works in reverse
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: Or you put your thumb through them as you try to pick them up. Either or
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Sam;: Better to be more ripe
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Better to be a mushy paste
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: >eating avocados
17/03/2020, 22:09 - David;: No - want to plan meals later in the week. Don't want an avocado shooting it's load on Monday when I'm having fajitas on Thursday do I?
17/03/2020, 22:14 - Rob;: This is why they sell ready to eat and ripen at home ones
17/03/2020, 22:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah this is based on very weak evidence in influenza, but ultimately paracetamol generally safer than ibuprofen anyway
17/03/2020, 22:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Not working in ITU but to be honest the entire speciality seems to be based on people fiddling about with ventilators
17/03/2020, 22:38 - / James Ball: had a ready to eat lidl avocado today. was perfect. no thumb holes
17/03/2020, 23:11 - Sam;: Quavers are great as well
18/03/2020, 01:13 - David;: This is the kind of analysis we'll need to get through this
18/03/2020, 08:20 - Damian Rumble: Madness. Everyone knows the fresh stuff from Aldi/Lidl is shit. Most of the time it's rotten before you've even got home.
18/03/2020, 09:20 - David;: You don't even eat fresh things damian how would you know about this. I don't believe they sell turkey twizlers
18/03/2020, 09:26 - Rob;: But he's right
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: It is more frequent that their stuff has a mouldy potato maybe
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: But I'm a lidl concert
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: Lol
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: Convert
18/03/2020, 09:31 - / James Ball: Can't do a full shop there. Need Waitrose or sainsburys for middle class essentials
18/03/2020, 09:33 - Damian Rumble: I don't think I've eaten a turkey twizzler in over 20years
18/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: In other news the milk man delivered today. He was out of stock of croissants so left me two packs of pain of chocolate and inexplicably a 4 pinter of milk along with my glass bottle of organic
18/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: Eating them subconsciously eh? No memory of them twizzling in
18/03/2020, 10:00 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 10:52 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 10:52 - Rob;: Last night's argument over Paul's fictional grand reminded me a lot of this
18/03/2020, 10:54 - Paul;: Lol that‚Äôs a great argument
18/03/2020, 10:54 - Paul;: That‚Äôs a fact
18/03/2020, 10:54 - Rob;: You don't even understand what a fact is
18/03/2020, 11:02 - Stefan;: The day after his birthday, he is no longer 28
18/03/2020, 11:02 - Stefan;: Pretty sure that happens on your birthday
18/03/2020, 11:32 - David;: Lol you're saying ¬£1.75 is a pound
18/03/2020, 11:32 - David;: Like that argument in the thick of it - 'the events leading up to the first world war do not include the first world war'
18/03/2020, 11:44 - Damian Rumble: Glastonbury ded
18/03/2020, 11:46 - David;: So it's peaking in 2 weeks. Yet everything is now cancelled until the autumn.
18/03/2020, 11:55 - Jack G;: Had work from a friend who works in the civil contingencies secretariat, apparently London will be going into full lockdown similar to Paris on Thursday
18/03/2020, 11:56 - Paul;: Just London?
18/03/2020, 11:57 - Jack G;: Yeah, apparently London is 4 weeks ahead of the rest of the UK
18/03/2020, 11:58 - Rob;: I had heard the same about Thursday from a police officer. Looking forward to moving house during that
18/03/2020, 12:11 - Damian Rumble: I should probably go and buy some food
18/03/2020, 12:13 - / James Ball: don't go to Aldi/Lidl
18/03/2020, 12:13 - Jack G;: More importantly, bog roll
18/03/2020, 12:13 - / James Ball: they don't have turkey twizzlers
18/03/2020, 12:14 - Damian Rumble: Big roll is all gone. Will buy twizzlers though to wipe my arse with
18/03/2020, 12:22 - David;: You've abandoned your roots. The classic Damian meal was turkey twizlers with cheesy chips and a ring doughnut
18/03/2020, 12:23 - David;: What would be your average go-to dinner these days?
18/03/2020, 12:29 - Damian Rumble: For lunch I quite like to whip up a baguette stuffed with rocket, brie, chicken and pesto. Or occasionally hammcoch Ham, extra mature cheddar, Caesar dressing over mixed salad leaves with some English mustard thrown in for good mixed
18/03/2020, 12:30 - Damian Rumble: There was great dive bar that sold mixed jerk chicken and mutton curry with rice, peas and plantain but I don't work near that place any more sadly
18/03/2020, 12:31 - Sam;: Hammcoch Ham
18/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Hammcoch Ham
18/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: >7
18/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Thanks SgtDavid
18/03/2020, 12:34 - / James Ball: Hammcoch Ham, thrown in for good mixed
18/03/2020, 12:35 - Jack G;: Sounds pretty good to be fair
18/03/2020, 12:35 - Jack G;: But I‚Äôm more interested in dinner
18/03/2020, 13:31 - Paul;: School closures incoming
18/03/2020, 13:36 - / James Ball: No way they can stay open
18/03/2020, 13:36 - / James Ball: I just had my last job cancel
18/03/2020, 13:36 - / James Ball: I'm now essentially unemployed
18/03/2020, 13:40 - Paul;: What do you do now in terms of claiming for things?
18/03/2020, 13:43 - / James Ball: No idea, nothing more than vague promises from the government, no actual action as yet
18/03/2020, 13:46 - Phill: It's ok, just take out a loan and don't pay any tax. Problem solved.
18/03/2020, 13:46 - Rob;: Sorry this is fucking you first James
18/03/2020, 13:47 - Sam;: from the FSB James
18/03/2020, 13:47 - Sam;: https://www.fsb.org.uk/campaign/covid19.html
18/03/2020, 13:47 - Rob;: I'm sure the new, robust Universal Credit system will be up to supporting you quickly. Have only heard good things
18/03/2020, 13:48 - Rob;: My company is pretty fucked. More than half the clients are airlines. I'm in the safer side of the business on Tesco, who are getting the loo roll millions, but it looks like 'voluntarily' paycuts are coming for us all.
18/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: Great time to have bought a house. Buy high sell low. Always said that
18/03/2020, 13:52 - Stefan;: Shit, sorry to hear it James
18/03/2020, 13:56 - / James Ball: I'm fortunate in that the job I've just been doing has paid well and I've got a lot in reserve. I'm sure I'll pick up more work later in the year as things progress but as it stands I have no income until possibly August/September now
18/03/2020, 14:18 - Sam;: are you looking into getting a cash grant?
18/03/2020, 14:24 - / James Ball: It's been announced but no information on how to claim yet
18/03/2020, 14:34 - David;: They've got to relax the benefit claim rules now. 'Tried looking for work again. Still none - virus sweeping the globe'
18/03/2020, 14:35 - David;: >the loo roll millions
18/03/2020, 14:38 - David;: I am also about to be unemployed. Contract ends in early April. They were just going through the process of extending it to September but now have no money due to the Asian students all fucking off and not applying to study for next year. Going to rinse higher education. Then all the other job and funding applications I have in I imagine no one is looking at as they are too busy writing coronavirus response guidance.
18/03/2020, 14:40 - / James Ball: that's shit as well.
18/03/2020, 14:41 - / James Ball: I'm worried for Will Ball's girlfriend. She is flying in from Serbia today to start a new job at Greenwich University, full time lecturer position. If that goes, so does her visa.
18/03/2020, 14:49 - Rob;: This is such a dry hump of a crisis
18/03/2020, 14:49 - Rob;: Over it
18/03/2020, 14:54 - Paul;: My mums moping around now
18/03/2020, 14:58 - David;: Yeah. I don't imagine they would cancel a position they have already appointed. It's more that they will not advertise for some positions for September they may otherwise have done.
18/03/2020, 14:59 - Rob;: The job market generally will be fucked for the foreseeable, won't it
18/03/2020, 14:59 - David;: Yep
18/03/2020, 14:59 - Rob;: We've suspended freelance bookings and new hires
18/03/2020, 14:59 - Rob;: People will accept wage reductions in those conditions
18/03/2020, 15:00 - David;: Plus if this happens and then student numbers actually hold up she may be fucked with higher teaching loads.
18/03/2020, 15:17 - David;: This does sound more like human-grade food. But what are you doing in the evenings?
18/03/2020, 15:23 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 15:26 - David;: How shit is the area of houses they've developed behind where the water tower is?
18/03/2020, 15:27 - David;: The encroaching metropolis
18/03/2020, 15:27 - Paul;: That‚Äôs been there for ages but fucking shit
18/03/2020, 15:27 - Paul;: Building new ones behind them as well. The soulless suburb
18/03/2020, 15:27 - Paul;: They look like houses that should only be built in the West Midlands outside of Birmingham
18/03/2020, 15:28 - Phill: Bet Christine is fuming but too scared to touch it incase contaminated
18/03/2020, 15:30 - David;: Yeah, hate that style of houses where it nods towards cotswold villiage but actually identical new build grot
18/03/2020, 15:30 - Paul;: Thin walls as well
18/03/2020, 15:30 - David;: Pretends to be twee
18/03/2020, 15:30 - David;: May as well paint a fake thatch texture onto the slates.
18/03/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: Prices will come right down. Mark and Karen have now lost their middle management jobs
18/03/2020, 15:31 - David;: Plus they never build any new infrastructure just houses.
18/03/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: Who will buy these places now
18/03/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: Yeah no infrastructure
18/03/2020, 15:32 - David;: Will become a dormitory town
18/03/2020, 15:32 - David;: have they not all been sold yet?
18/03/2020, 15:32 - Paul;: No still under construction
18/03/2020, 15:33 - David;: Weeeel
18/03/2020, 15:36 - Paul;: Wonder how much house prices will drop by
18/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: I don't want to think about that
18/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: To close
18/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: Too*
18/03/2020, 15:38 - Paul;: I‚Äôm buying at the moment. Locked in. Kicked off the process 2 weeks ago
18/03/2020, 15:38 - David;: If you're planning to live there for a few years it should recover by then
18/03/2020, 15:38 - Rob;: We've fixed for 5 years, so fingers crossed
18/03/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: Have exchanged, so legally it all has to go ahead. Wonder how that will work if they do enforced lockdown
18/03/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: Where?
18/03/2020, 15:40 - David;: Selling the shart?
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: Chippy. Hitchmans mews
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: Shart is sold
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Rob;: Get us a link Paul
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: It‚Äôs not on the market
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: Bought it off market
18/03/2020, 15:41 - Paul;: But it‚Äôs a Victorian mews house that will be refurbished by some architects
18/03/2020, 15:41 - Paul;: Assuming the virus doesn‚Äôt put a stop to it all
18/03/2020, 15:42 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 15:43 - David;: Where in Chippy?
18/03/2020, 15:44 - Paul;: Hitchmans mews. Pretty much opposite where the shart is
18/03/2020, 15:45 - David;: Sorry don't have the Chippy A-Z memorised in my head
18/03/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: The Lane next to winebear / where betfair is. Opposite old mill cafe
18/03/2020, 15:46 - David;: Ah so you'll be even closer to winebear
18/03/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: It‚Äôs closed down
18/03/2020, 15:46 - David;: Was going to happen. But has the pizzeria he tried to replace it with also gone?
18/03/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: Yep
18/03/2020, 15:47 - David;: Decline and Fall. What's richard going to do with himself now? Where can you go from there?
18/03/2020, 15:48 - Paul;: I‚Äôm not actually sure where he is
18/03/2020, 15:48 - David;: Very Icarus
18/03/2020, 15:48 - Paul;: He was in France working in a ski resort bar I think
18/03/2020, 15:49 - David;: Can't imagine him holding down a 9-5 now
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: So far today I have been to two co-ops. Iceland. Waitrose. And a bunch of small corner shops. None of which have had a big roll.
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Rob;: Sure that will be going just fine right now
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: Big*
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: Bog*
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: 7
18/03/2020, 16:08 - David;: How many rolls are you down to?
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: 5
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: In a house of 4
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: Two women
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: Do the math
18/03/2020, 16:12 - Rob;: Ah you're fucked
18/03/2020, 16:18 - Paul;: That would be 0 days
18/03/2020, 16:20 - Damian Rumble: At lunch I saw a news clip on BBC one that effectively went like this...

[Anchor] - super markets have been opening thier doors early to allow elderly people a chance to visit the stores safely. 

Cuts to interview with some old women carrying two massive 24 packs of bog roll and a shopping trolley filled with more 

[Boomer, to interviewer] - well it's really nice to allow us to pop in early and get myself some loo roll. ... And this one is for my friend...
18/03/2020, 16:27 - Paul;: >boomer
18/03/2020, 16:30 - Jack G;: You‚Äôre finished, no chance. Might as well call it a day
18/03/2020, 16:31 - Jack G;: Sitting pretty at 31 rolls still
18/03/2020, 16:33 - / James Ball: jack the hoarder.
18/03/2020, 16:33 - / James Ball: normal 24 jack
18/03/2020, 16:34 - Paul;: Just your normal 24
18/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: we have 13 plus 2 on the go
18/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: >2 toilets
18/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: >can both simultaneously shit
18/03/2020, 16:35 - Rob;: Greater than two toilets but less than 3?
18/03/2020, 16:36 - / James Ball: yeah yeah. full toiler
18/03/2020, 16:53 - David;: Have 5 left. I'm not even remotely worried
18/03/2020, 16:54 - David;: Will start to think about it when there is half a roll left on the reel
18/03/2020, 16:55 - Jack G;: Literal squeaky bum time
18/03/2020, 16:56 - David;: That's still 5 shits or so. Couple of days. So I'll just start to bear it in mind at that point.
18/03/2020, 16:58 - David;: 31 rolls is complete madness. You've lost your senses
18/03/2020, 16:59 - Sam;: Don‚Äôt forget Dave that all your shit are happening at home now... work toilet can‚Äôt take the brunt off your shit for you now.
18/03/2020, 16:59 - / James Ball: I also think the coffee shits is fake news
18/03/2020, 16:59 - / James Ball: I'm on my fourth mug now and yet to shit
18/03/2020, 17:00 - David;: Yeah but I maybe shit twice a day. Now one of those is at home rather than work.
18/03/2020, 17:00 - David;: What kind of coffee?
18/03/2020, 17:00 - / James Ball: 3x fresh cafetiere mugs and 1x instant
18/03/2020, 17:00 - Sam;: Doubled the demand you were previously placing on your rolls
18/03/2020, 17:01 - David;: True but doubling from a very low base
18/03/2020, 17:01 - David;: I'm not overly concerned
18/03/2020, 17:01 - Rob;: What's Fay's consumption like?
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Jack G;: You‚Äôre way too confident here Dave
18/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Don't feel the need to get a years supply in
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Damian Rumble: Hoping this rumor of shutting down London is just a rumour. I won't last 3 months with such dire loo roll supplies
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Rob;: I can't get over how much more women use
18/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Jack you're part of the problem.
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Rob;: I lived with women at uni, but I'd forgotten what the loo roll demand was like
18/03/2020, 17:03 - Jack G;: Not really. I bought one pack of 24. Regular (apparently) people like you wouldn‚Äôt go anywhere near that so you‚Äôre not missing anything
18/03/2020, 17:03 - David;: Haven't noticed it - to be fair she often buys the loo roll that's partly where this complacency stems from. I just assume theres always bog roll there.
18/03/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: But you already had 7 rolls when you bought it
18/03/2020, 17:04 - Jack G;: And who‚Äôs laughing now?
18/03/2020, 17:04 - David;: My feeling is this is an artificial temporary problem caused by people needlessly clearing out the stock currently on the shelves. Everyone will now have loads so as it is restocked demand will be less. That's when I enter the market
18/03/2020, 17:05 - David;: There will likely be an oversupply crisis as they adjust to higher demand but everyone is in fact shitting at just the same rate as always. I can clean up on the lower prices that may bring.
18/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Who's laughing then Jack? As you work through your 31 rolls bought at the peak of the bubble
18/03/2020, 17:08 - Jack G;: I think I‚Äôll be alright. An extra ¬£1 now is worth having no stress about whether I can afford to shit or not
18/03/2020, 17:20 - Jack G;: All schools shut from Friday then
18/03/2020, 17:23 - David;: Schools ded
18/03/2020, 17:23 - Jack G;: Exams over?
18/03/2020, 17:24 - David;: So that's all sectors also ded. Everyone having to stay at home to look after children.
18/03/2020, 17:25 - Phill: Man I fucking wish I was still at school. Year 10. Would just fucking slam hours and hours into wow .
18/03/2020, 17:26 - Jack G;: Exams cancelled too. Epic for year 10‚Äôs
18/03/2020, 17:27 - Sam;: Children of key workers like NHS staff and delivery drivers will have special provisions so they can still work
18/03/2020, 17:28 - Rob;: Yeah, that GCSE summer was long as it was
18/03/2020, 17:29 - Rob;: Now it starts in March. So much football manager
18/03/2020, 17:30 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 17:31 - Rob;: 18!
18/03/2020, 17:31 - Damian Rumble: Notice I have gone for a socially acceptable 18 rather than hording over 30
18/03/2020, 17:31 - David;: Yeah. Hundreds of seasons. Could start a real project. League 2 to European champions
18/03/2020, 17:31 - Sam;: Fake news then
18/03/2020, 17:32 - / James Ball: 2 packs
18/03/2020, 17:32 - / James Ball: hoarding
18/03/2020, 17:32 - Phill: Big fan of the kebab van sauce selection in the background
18/03/2020, 17:32 - Phill: Garlic. Burger. Brown.
18/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: Thing is they will just have to do it next year? So sort of shit
18/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: Hanging over you longer
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: So everyone kind of misses a year
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Phill: And gets a grand woop
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Phill: Woop whoop
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Jack G;: Not this again
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: The grands coming
18/03/2020, 17:34 - Phill: #granddesigns #grabagrand #prosecco #livelovegrand
18/03/2020, 17:34 - David;: Ariana grand
18/03/2020, 17:36 - Rob;: Will we just get a thick generation now? Generation dumb
18/03/2020, 17:36 - David;: Lel would be so shit to be a child of a key worker. The only ones in school while everyone else gets pissed and plays football manager
18/03/2020, 17:37 - Jack G;: Can‚Äôt be having a Bloody Sunday though with social distancing in place
18/03/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: There were only 54 kids at Great Tew primary, might just be one kid with a parent key worker
18/03/2020, 17:38 - / James Ball: no exams means no a-levels means no university enrolments?
18/03/2020, 17:38 - David;: Yeah that's potentially fucked up everything
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: Just write off this year
18/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: a gap of one year at both year 7 and higher education next year
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Jack G;: Probably go off predicted grades
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Jack G;: And any coursework
18/03/2020, 17:39 - David;: Nah, you can't do that
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: If only we had cryogenic freezing. This would be easy to fix
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: That‚Äôs like letting Liverpool win the league
18/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: not convinced
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: You can‚Äôt count the coursework
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: Yeah. Impossible
18/03/2020, 17:40 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs either that or everyone redoes the year
18/03/2020, 17:40 - Rob;: What if Man City get your A-levels instead? Can't rule it out
18/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: gap year and just do your exams in the summer
18/03/2020, 17:40 - David;: No, just have the exams in the autumn and start year 1 uni in January possibly. But that's fucked as well
18/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: *autumn
18/03/2020, 17:40 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs the premier league conundrum amplified
18/03/2020, 17:41 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 17:42 - / James Ball: If 2020 is so fucked now can we just roll the new year forward.
18/03/2020, 17:43 - / James Ball: New year in August, new year, new start. Just wipe the slate
18/03/2020, 17:43 - Paul;: Wipe the arse
18/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: They only allowed us 2 months of fucking normality between Brexit and Corona
18/03/2020, 17:44 - David;: Thought that was the crisis over? Nah mate, we're shoving a global pandemic up your national sphincter
18/03/2020, 17:45 - / James Ball: almost 3000 dead in Italy now
18/03/2020, 17:46 - Damian Rumble: And in those two months all of Australia was burnt to the ground and most of the UK flooded
18/03/2020, 17:47 - Jack G;: Lol Boris completely ignoring the question about brexit transition period and extending it due to pandemic taking up all government time
18/03/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: That‚Äôs schools shut all the way through till September then?
18/03/2020, 17:48 - / James Ball: quite likely
18/03/2020, 17:48 - Damian Rumble: Love that. It's Jan 202. We're about to told we are going into quarentine for a second time, only this time it's straight off the back of a no deal brexit
18/03/2020, 17:48 - Phill: Just your average afternoon in storm wind jack
18/03/2020, 17:48 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: How to being a nation to its knees in under 5 years
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: Bring*
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Jack G;: Irresponsible wow players. Auction house and bank should be avoided according to quarantine measures
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Phill: I'm a big fan of quarantine. My productivity is through the roof.
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Phill: I've got relatives bringing me shopping which I don't have to pay for.
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Quarantine might extend beyond 3 months as well do you think?
18/03/2020, 17:49 - / James Ball: grants not loans
18/03/2020, 17:51 - Jack G;: Unlikely. Think it will end in May but then a second smaller quarantine over winter when the virus makes a cone back
18/03/2020, 17:52 - Phill: I don't have to get out of bed until 8:25
18/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: I think we‚Äôre fucked. Year in isolation
18/03/2020, 17:53 - David;: Can we just go back to the strategy where we let everything run loose and hope for the best. That seemed much nicer.
18/03/2020, 17:54 - Rob;: Yeah, was a fan
18/03/2020, 17:54 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah, and a nice cafeti√®re as well rather than crappy office coffee
18/03/2020, 17:54 - Rob;: Back when we were a herd
18/03/2020, 17:55 - David;: Yeah, pining our hopes vaguely on herd immunity. Everyone gets the flu and then gets on with it.
18/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: So they will give qualifications somehow. But not specified how.
18/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Excellent
18/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Everyone gets straight Cs? Leveling up
18/03/2020, 17:58 - Phill: >not buying a cafetiere on your first day, people taking the piss, now everyone has one.
18/03/2020, 18:01 - David;: Johnson looking quite ropey in this one. Should probably have PM shift working.
18/03/2020, 18:02 - Phill: Yeah thought he was looking very clammy
18/03/2020, 18:03 - David;: Vallance as well. Looks knackered. Less assured than the first few
18/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: So teachers still have to work just to look after key worker children? How's that going to work?
18/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Reckon that is probably a very good idea
18/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: I think all key workers children will be in school doing remote learning
18/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: But the child care is key
18/03/2020, 18:12 - David;: Yeah agree they need to go somewhere. But weird to make secondary School teachers cover that
18/03/2020, 18:12 - Phill: They're not exactly going to be doing anything else
18/03/2020, 18:13 - David;: True but so every teacher - English, maths, science etc. to teach a handful of children? Or one goes in per day and they get straight maths, straight english? Classes covering all age groups or still split by year group? Just don't get practically how that would function
18/03/2020, 18:14 - David;: Also ironically they will be getting taught content while no one else is - puts them at an unfair advantage?
18/03/2020, 18:15 - David;: Unless its like end of term days at chippy where they stick Blackadder on and pretend it teaches us about WW1
18/03/2020, 18:16 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs an unprecedented situation. No one has ideal solutions and honestly there probably aren‚Äôt any
18/03/2020, 18:16 - Paul;: One solution is to always buy your normal everyday 24 pack of bog roll though
18/03/2020, 18:16 - Jack G;: üëç
18/03/2020, 18:18 - Hamish Sinclair: I dont think they will have classes
18/03/2020, 18:18 - Hamish Sinclair: They will have remote learning/online learning
18/03/2020, 18:18 - Hamish Sinclair: So will all essentially be babysat at school
18/03/2020, 18:18 - David;: So going school to be taught by teachers who are at home?
18/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: Italy put 10k student doctors into service 9 months ahead of schedule. Same here do you think?
18/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: I dont think anyone is being taight
18/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: I suspect all schools will use online resources
18/03/2020, 18:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Possibly
18/03/2020, 18:20 - Jack G;: >Mr Wooldridge trying to teach his class physics over google hangouts
18/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: Lol
18/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: Woodridge
18/03/2020, 18:20 - / James Ball: thought this too. cumpled suit, crooked tie, very coronavirus about the face
18/03/2020, 18:20 - / James Ball: They'll have to have staff in though for H&S reasons at least
18/03/2020, 18:21 - / James Ball: the final few months of physics were just Look Around You on the projector
18/03/2020, 18:21 - David;: Yeah that's what I was thinking. Once you have anyone there you need security, catering staff, cleaners
18/03/2020, 18:21 - / James Ball: his literal countdown to retirement on the top corner of the board
18/03/2020, 18:22 - David;: Mental with the exams. You can't go on grades predicted a year before the exams to determine university entry
18/03/2020, 18:22 - Jack G;: Should have done better at AS level Dave. Next
18/03/2020, 18:23 - / James Ball: very ropey. Harriet pointed out there will be a number of students already accepted but deferred start ie gap yahh
18/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Would be ridiculous. Especially as they sometimes deflate predicted grades to impact their metrics on how many student over-perform predictions. So an incentive to under-predict
18/03/2020, 18:24 - / James Ball: can't let students attend (and take on the financial responsibilities) to have them take exams in autumn and fail
18/03/2020, 18:24 - / James Ball: January start? Most universities already do a September and January intake?
18/03/2020, 18:25 - David;: We don't do January intake. It's possible but they would be butt hurt if they paid full tuition fees for 1/2 year of teaching. Plus, they would miss a lot of content. That's 1/6th of a standard BA course.
18/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Government could refund tuition fees I guess.
18/03/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: Yeah, January intake but then Universities have to do an additional summer term?
18/03/2020, 18:27 - David;: That's possible. People would hate that as that's the only part of the year we get any research done usually.
18/03/2020, 18:28 - / James Ball: That's true, I've got friends in research units who would hate it. It's just going to fuck everything for a whole cycle
18/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: Yeah it's all pretty fucked
18/03/2020, 18:32 - / James Ball: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
18/03/2020, 18:32 - / James Ball: good to have the live stats readout
18/03/2020, 18:33 - David;: Wonder if this will usher in a new welfare state as happened following WW2. Johnson/Churchill - Starmer/Attlee?
18/03/2020, 18:34 - David;: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ this is also decent.
18/03/2020, 18:54 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 18:55 - / James Ball: only a 12A?
18/03/2020, 19:06 - / James Ball: Just on the Saint Etienne group chat - one of the band and family have nearly all the symptoms
18/03/2020, 19:06 - / James Ball: not confirmed virus but very likely
18/03/2020, 19:07 - Paul;: There was a 3rd from work as well
18/03/2020, 19:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Did wonder this, not sure how the arguments against big government stack up now
18/03/2020, 19:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Turns out we cant just all govern ourselves without state intervention
18/03/2020, 19:09 - Paul;: Actually really shit
18/03/2020, 19:21 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt believe people give a shit about the Eurovision being cancelled
18/03/2020, 19:22 - / James Ball: Largest TV broadcast in the world?
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Who the hell is even watching it. Never known someone to announce it as a big event coming up for them
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Must make that night free. Eurovision is on
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: ‚ÄúCan‚Äôt wait for Eurovision this year‚Äù
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: You never hear it
18/03/2020, 19:23 - / James Ball: I have watched but always by chance rather than choice
18/03/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: From my older brother. Tescos in Amersham
18/03/2020, 19:27 - Paul;: Ah
18/03/2020, 19:29 - / James Ball: People better not drink all the wine. Production times too long for continual production
18/03/2020, 19:30 - / James Ball: I just remembered I have a home brewing kit ready to go from my birthday
18/03/2020, 19:30 - / James Ball: 48 pints of ale
18/03/2020, 19:30 - Paul;: Get that going immediately
18/03/2020, 19:31 - / James Ball: I actually might start it tomorrow
18/03/2020, 19:31 - Phill: Me too actually
18/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: The brewer
18/03/2020, 19:32 - Paul;: Annoyingly you‚Äôve used all your bottles for piss storage
18/03/2020, 19:32 - / James Ball: the baker, the shit paper taker
18/03/2020, 19:32 - / James Ball: yeah yeah. will need to acquire more bottles. I also just have a big 48 pint barrel but that requires more immediate drinking before it all goes off
18/03/2020, 19:36 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 19:36 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 19:37 - / James Ball: *40 pints
18/03/2020, 19:37 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 19:38 - / James Ball: hammered bint
18/03/2020, 19:44 - Damian Rumble: We should totally each produce a brew and bring a barrel to the next Wales. What could possibly go wrong...
18/03/2020, 19:44 - David;: Whitty
18/03/2020, 19:44 - David;: Not a charismatic figure
18/03/2020, 19:45 - David;: Lol I like the idea that have to give you tips on how alcohol might be used
18/03/2020, 19:46 - David;: I think if you've bought a home brewing kit you might have the general gist already
18/03/2020, 19:47 - David;: Should organise a Wales for one of the mad corona-free weeks
18/03/2020, 19:47 - / James Ball: Just relaxed home drinking in wales
18/03/2020, 19:47 - David;: Drink ourselves to a stupour. These will become the equivalent of the medieval peasant festivals.
18/03/2020, 19:48 - David;: When we're let out by the government for the week. Each given a ration of 1 flagon of mead
18/03/2020, 19:48 - / James Ball: Just don't drink any of the hedgerow wine at Phil's house. Last time we had that a full 2 day hangover ensued, definite methanol content
18/03/2020, 19:49 - Paul;: The hedgerow wine?
18/03/2020, 19:50 - / James Ball: a swarthy, sharp little number. Phil, Becca, Harriet and I had a bottle. Complete blackout
18/03/2020, 19:50 - Stefan;: It's the greatest cultural event of the year for me and my friends. This is devastating, equivalent to all the football tournaments being cancelled for you
18/03/2020, 19:50 - David;: Lol
18/03/2020, 19:50 - Stefan;: Gay Christmas is cancelled
18/03/2020, 19:50 - David;: Paul do you remember that wine my dad brewed that kept getting stronger and stronger
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: Yeah fortified wine it tastes like
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: Very close
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: *tasted
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: Pictures of army trucks being moved into London circulating
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: Had bits floating in it
18/03/2020, 19:51 - David;: Yeah had a real sulphur edge to it
18/03/2020, 19:52 - / James Ball: @447540496004 have you still got hedgerow left?
18/03/2020, 19:52 - David;: But would get you pissed in a couple of glasses
18/03/2020, 19:52 - Paul;: Well show us then raaaaabbbb
18/03/2020, 19:52 - Phill: I darent touch it after our mad night
18/03/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: Was on my housemates phone
18/03/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: She's just gone upstairs to use all the bog roll
18/03/2020, 19:54 - Rob;: I just looked it up. At least one of the images she showed me is bollocks
18/03/2020, 19:54 - Rob;: Taken near a permanent cadet base in london
18/03/2020, 19:55 - David;: Lol
18/03/2020, 19:56 - David;: >the hedgerow wine
18/03/2020, 19:56 - David;: What were the ingredients?
18/03/2020, 19:56 - / James Ball: it was brutal
18/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: A legendary possibly mythic concoction
18/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: So a 3 day hangover?
18/03/2020, 19:58 - David;: How much was brewed and how much still remains?
18/03/2020, 19:58 - / James Ball: Becca was gone. Phil woke up and had a dominos immediately I seem to remember
18/03/2020, 19:58 - / James Ball: I could barely see
18/03/2020, 19:59 - / James Ball: I think there were a few bottles left
18/03/2020, 20:00 - / James Ball: I would guess about 20% ABV but probably some methanol content
18/03/2020, 20:01 - Phill: I drove to dominos in my pyjamas at 10AM and ate it in the car
18/03/2020, 20:01 - Phill: James was out in the garden looking at the lawn at 8am and was sick
18/03/2020, 20:02 - / James Ball: ah yeah. lol. forgot about lawn time
18/03/2020, 20:02 - Phill: We were speaking Swahili
18/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: Can‚Äôt just drop that in
18/03/2020, 20:03 - / James Ball: happened
18/03/2020, 20:03 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 20:03 - David;: Nah
18/03/2020, 20:03 - David;: Lol lawn time
18/03/2020, 20:04 - / James Ball: Just needed a good inspection at 8 before a little chunder and uncontrollable sweating
18/03/2020, 20:04 - Phill: A mad night.
18/03/2020, 20:04 - Paul;: Drinking methanol
18/03/2020, 20:06 - / James Ball: I still felt rough on the Monday, drinking was on Saturday
18/03/2020, 20:08 - David;: Reminds me of Sambos hangover in air froust one. Never left the floor of the flat. His body rejected water and all solids.
18/03/2020, 20:11 - Paul;: I do like that story
18/03/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: Sambo how was that day for you?
18/03/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Worst hangover of life. Stomach muscles in pain for a week after due to number and ferocity of vomiting sessions
18/03/2020, 21:02 - David;: I'd estimate the second day would have been the equivalent of a bad first day hangover? So the first day was a completely new level
18/03/2020, 21:11 - Sam;: Yeah. Dealing with tube was hard. I imagined it‚Äôs what it‚Äôs like to be old and infirm.
18/03/2020, 21:11 - Paul;: So you couldn‚Äôt have handled a dose of corona that morning?
18/03/2020, 21:12 - Sam;: No way.
18/03/2020, 21:14 - Paul;: Took over a week for full recovery?
18/03/2020, 21:15 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:15 - Sam;: Yeah a week
18/03/2020, 21:21 - David;: May need this
18/03/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: You'll probably end up wearing it more than any Liverpool player
18/03/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: How do they manage to take such shit quality photos of these things
18/03/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: Every time some new product leaks it‚Äôs always the worst quality
18/03/2020, 21:23 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, always getting leaked by yer nan with her Nokia 3310
18/03/2020, 21:24 - Paul;: Everyone leaking pictures inexplicably still owns the original Motorola razr
18/03/2020, 21:24 - Paul;: An Olympus 1MP digital camera
18/03/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:30 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:31 - David;: Yeah. Dem ratios
18/03/2020, 21:32 - Rob;: Although numbers of confirmed cases is basically bollocks at this point isn't it?
18/03/2020, 21:32 - David;: Could be that they are testing more
18/03/2020, 21:32 - David;: Also have a good health service.
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Phill: Got my results back today
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Rob;: If anyone was going to handle it well, you'd have said it was them
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Rob;: Lol
18/03/2020, 21:45 - / James Ball: strong test. dominant
18/03/2020, 21:50 - Phill: Hamish why is Germany death rate so low? Lots of testing of mild cases?
18/03/2020, 22:00 - Damian Rumble: Lol
18/03/2020, 22:00 - Damian Rumble: Also lol
18/03/2020, 22:26 - David;: Everything is quite johnned
18/03/2020, 22:31 - Rob;: The football is over
18/03/2020, 22:31 - Rob;: Can't really get over that even
18/03/2020, 22:32 - Rob;: I'll never see Arsenal play FK Qarabag again
18/03/2020, 22:37 - David;: Yeah. Quite a boring apocalypse
18/03/2020, 22:37 - David;: EastEnders not a huge loss.
18/03/2020, 22:38 - David;: Couldn't have predicted this
18/03/2020, 22:38 - David;: They're forecasting US unemployment levels going close to the great depression
18/03/2020, 23:03 - Damian Rumble: That would really ruin trump. Delicious
19/03/2020, 00:16 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 07:01 - Phill: There's your vaccine just make that
19/03/2020, 07:03 - Paul;: What percentage is that?
19/03/2020, 07:16 - Rob;: Why go to the trouble of turning something invisible into something useful and intelligle, then in convert that into colourful useless noise
19/03/2020, 07:16 - Rob;: All genomes would look the same
19/03/2020, 07:17 - Paul;: Bog roll update. Garage no stock

19/03/2020, 08:19 - Phill: Lol looking back at some of these Brexit memes
19/03/2020, 08:19 - Phill: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 09:13 - David;: Why is coronavirus a 16-bit SNES game?
19/03/2020, 09:16 - Paul;: Can you even do anything with this?
19/03/2020, 09:16 - Rob;: No it's pointless
19/03/2020, 09:16 - Rob;: They've taken the information and scrambled it
19/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: The full genome in AUGC neclotides is amazingly useful. This isn't
19/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: Bit like converting all the letters in the Hamlet to colours
19/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: Cool, but why?
19/03/2020, 09:19 - Paul;: To create a vaccine for hamlet?
19/03/2020, 09:23 - David;: This man's got pork to rent.
19/03/2020, 09:24 - David;: How do you even procrastinate effectively without endless football gossip and fantasy football?
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Football manager 2020 is free for the next week
19/03/2020, 09:24 - David;: Ah.
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Rob;: No
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Rob;: They haven't
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Rob;: Fuck
19/03/2020, 09:25 - David;: Nah
19/03/2020, 09:25 - David;: I could have just one drink. Just this once.
19/03/2020, 09:39 - Rob;: Imagine self-quaretining with your partner, but they're gripped by an intense FM addiction
19/03/2020, 09:39 - Rob;: Your only company can't pull away from Notts County's 2027/28 transfer window
19/03/2020, 09:41 - Rob;: Would a great troll if FM 2020 just simulated the lockdown
19/03/2020, 09:43 - Phill: Lol I'm getting it
19/03/2020, 09:43 - Phill: Is there online? Should we do an online season?
19/03/2020, 09:43 - Phill: Against each other
19/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: Yeah it's just all the nucleotides in order represented as colours. Just interesting that all of this is caused by just under 8Kb of data
19/03/2020, 10:01 - Hamish Sinclair: You will all have bought it within a week
19/03/2020, 11:37 - David;: Hamish how difficult would it be to do wartime-style conscription for the NHS to help manage the pressure. Train civilians to do basic corona-specific procedures or testing.
19/03/2020, 11:38 - David;: Take the pressure off.
19/03/2020, 11:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Reckon your best bet would be maximising everything you can do to keep existing staff at work (help with childcare,  test nhs family member to prevent periods of self isolation etc)
19/03/2020, 11:41 - Hamish Sinclair: While simultaneously training existing medical staff in covid relevant skills
19/03/2020, 11:42 - Rob;: Could nurseries be made to stay open for keyworker children? Most seem to be closing. My sister's one is charging 80% fees even though they're offering no care
19/03/2020, 11:42 - Hamish Sinclair: They're considering letting nhs staff stay I  hotels if they have someone at home unwell to allow them to continue working
19/03/2020, 11:42 - Hamish Sinclair: That's outrageous
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Hamish Sinclair: The difficulty with childcare is you need to also isolate grandparents etc
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Hamish Sinclair: So most people have lost their backup plan
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Rob;: Obviously they can cancel, the threat is that they lose their place and when things return to normal you don't have childcare
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah sounds like they are being massive pricks about that
19/03/2020, 11:45 - Rob;: Seems like there will be a lot of jobless people soon who could be brought in to do something somewhere
19/03/2020, 11:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah. We have all be warned that there could be a situation where frontline staff are effectively socially excluded as they will have high rates if infection and will be continuing to work/travel
19/03/2020, 11:47 - Hamish Sinclair: A infected undercllass
19/03/2020, 11:47 - / James Ball: You get the jobless swabbing for covid though and surely it devalues the results somewhat? Can be less sure of quality of data
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Stabbing not difficult tbf
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Swabbing
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Rob;: Yet also put greatest hope
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah lol. Everyone fully reliant yet scared to be around
19/03/2020, 11:49 - / James Ball: I agree but also underclass potentially got able to bash two rocks together
19/03/2020, 11:49 - / James Ball: Not*
19/03/2020, 11:50 - Hamish Sinclair: The underclass are the healthcare workers
19/03/2020, 11:51 - / James Ball: Ah
19/03/2020, 11:52 - / James Ball: Many metaphors going on here
19/03/2020, 11:54 - David;: You'll get the status of national heroes like the RAF though. Could be worse. Milk that for decades
19/03/2020, 11:54 - Rob;: As a generation we can milk the fuck out of this
19/03/2020, 11:55 - Rob;: And all the people born around now can in 60 years pretend they lived through it too and vote for some weird Brexit like thing because of it
19/03/2020, 11:57 - Sam;: we've got loads to harp on about; financial crisis, climate change, brexit. now this.
19/03/2020, 11:58 - Rob;: And crucially we won't be wealthy when old
19/03/2020, 11:59 - Rob;: Although perhaps the younger gens will just be even more fucked so they'll hate us anyway
19/03/2020, 11:59 - Sam;: yeah. they'll think we had it good compared to them and we'll be hated like boomers.
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: Yeah we can now be those cunts
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: In 60 years time
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: We'll ironically be simultaneously snowflakes and a blitz spirit generation.
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: You rarely see that combo
19/03/2020, 12:04 - / James Ball: You whippersnappers never had it so tough as the winter of '20. Ocado stopped deliveries and we all had to stay indoors
19/03/2020, 12:07 - David;: Yeah that's the issue. The main practical consequence is sitting on our arse indoors. Harder to milk that.
19/03/2020, 12:08 - David;: Need some good generational PR on this to be full cunts about it
19/03/2020, 12:10 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 12:19 - Damian Rumble: My housemate just got sent home for having a persistent cough. We're fucked
19/03/2020, 12:20 - Paul;: 14 day isolation for you. Make sure you stick to it
19/03/2020, 12:20 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 12:24 - David;: Going to pub tonight then?
19/03/2020, 12:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Why the fuck was he in work?
19/03/2020, 12:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah you've just bought yourself some sweet self isolation
19/03/2020, 12:25 - / James Ball: This. No one allowed in or out Damo
19/03/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: I know you struggle to understand the concept of infecting at risk people but you‚Äôve got to stick to it
19/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: You're likely infected as well, as they will have been asymptomatic for days
19/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: Just bed in
19/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: Could be a good time to drop acid. Could go either way.
19/03/2020, 12:32 - / James Ball: Covid hallucination could be strong
19/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Yeah, watch Channel 4 in-depth news on acid safe in the knowledge you might have it
19/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: See no issues there
19/03/2020, 12:34 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 12:34 - David;: These are excellent by the way
19/03/2020, 12:34 - David;: 10/10
19/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: China now has no new domestic cases.
19/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: They really nipped that in the bud
19/03/2020, 12:38 - Rob;: I was thinking about how their enormous size helped them there. Could quarantine an are the size of most countries but keep some economy going during
19/03/2020, 12:38 - Rob;: If the US had quarantined after first cases they might have been able to do the same
19/03/2020, 12:39 - Rob;: Also with it originating there they didn't initially have to deal with it being imported over the whole country from outside, so they could focus
19/03/2020, 12:40 - David;: Shouldn't they make things worse? It all being concentrated in one place overwhelming it vs having it more evenly spread.
19/03/2020, 12:40 - David;: That's why Italy has been so fucked
19/03/2020, 12:41 - Rob;: Yeah, fucks that region, but in terms of a quarantine working and not fucking your economy absolutely it was perhaps an advantage
19/03/2020, 12:42 - Rob;: Italy got all it's cased from people randomly flying into different places, China new almost all of its were in Wuhan
19/03/2020, 12:42 - Rob;: *its, cases, knew, etc
19/03/2020, 13:05 - / James Ball: @447854020575 do you have pneumonia yet?
19/03/2020, 13:05 - / James Ball: Need temp chart to track your fever
19/03/2020, 13:06 - Paul;: Oh yeah chart your temperature for us
19/03/2020, 13:06 - Paul;: At least 3 readings a day
19/03/2020, 13:06 - Paul;: See the trends
19/03/2020, 13:08 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 13:08 - Damian Rumble: She is a mental health support worker so she has had to spend her time out in the community visiting sick people. It was inevitable she would get ill
19/03/2020, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: Though tbh I have only spent 5 mins of time with her with the last 5 or 6 days
19/03/2020, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: @447526575752  what is the come up time? From infection to showing symptoms
19/03/2020, 13:10 - Paul;: You still have to isolate for 14 days
19/03/2020, 13:10 - Damian Rumble: To make matters work I changed internet provider and the new box was supposed to come today, only the pick couldn't be fucked to ring the doorbell and just left us a red letter. So now I have to go out and pick it up tomorrow or face two weeks with no internet
19/03/2020, 13:11 - Paul;: I know you‚Äôre trying to weasel your way out of it
19/03/2020, 13:11 - Paul;: Get someone to get it for you
19/03/2020, 13:12 - / James Ball: No you don't. You are not allowed to leave Damo!
19/03/2020, 13:12 - / James Ball: I have no internet
19/03/2020, 13:12 - / James Ball: You can arrange a redeliver if it's royal mail
19/03/2020, 13:13 - / James Ball: Redeliver. Can't risk key royal mail workers for Damo's new router
19/03/2020, 13:28 - Paul;: <Media omitted>

19/03/2020, 13:45 - David;: Glad that it actually produced quite an elegant matrix like pattern
19/03/2020, 13:45 - Rob;: Thank you SgtDavid
19/03/2020, 13:45 - Jack G;: The best part was the really small trolly reply after I‚Äôd asked you to stop
19/03/2020, 13:45 - Jack G;: Somehow that happened
19/03/2020, 13:46 - David;: Could have chosen much worse threads for that to happen in
19/03/2020, 13:46 - Stefan;: Yeah a very pleasing regular pattern

19/03/2020, 14:08 - / James Ball: > only paying attention when you are at risk
19/03/2020, 14:08 - / James Ball: various studies on incubation time
19/03/2020, 14:09 - / James Ball: as low as 2 days as high as 29 days in one isolated case. I think median time is 6.2 days or something
19/03/2020, 14:48 - David;: I find the BBC coverage quite shit
19/03/2020, 14:49 - David;: Just vox pops of how Deidre in Hampshire is coping.
19/03/2020, 14:49 - David;: Doesn't give the global picture well at all
19/03/2020, 14:49 - Paul;: Yeah hate that shit
19/03/2020, 14:56 - / James Ball: BBC coverage is shit for most things now, CNN a bit more shouty but quite balanced for an American platform
19/03/2020, 14:56 - / James Ball: writing is better, they use full sentences and everything is not in quotes
19/03/2020, 16:37 - Paul;: Toilet roll just stocked in coop. Can only buy one pack (Jack)
19/03/2020, 16:41 - Jack G;: I‚Äôve never bought more than one pack of toilet paper in my life
19/03/2020, 16:42 - Paul;: Lol
19/03/2020, 16:44 - Jack G;: Buying one pack of 24 perfectly legal as far as I can tell
19/03/2020, 16:53 - David;: Will be good to watch some Chinese super league when that gets going again. Now they're corona free
19/03/2020, 16:53 - David;: They might get huge ratings
19/03/2020, 16:53 - Paul;: All top players transfer to China?
19/03/2020, 16:53 - Paul;: Messi playing for Wuhan FC
19/03/2020, 16:54 - David;: Better playing at Wuhan than quarantined in Barceona
19/03/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: British clubs could just buy stadiums over there
19/03/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: Have a two week quarantine training camp then away they go
19/03/2020, 16:58 - Rob;: Wuhan Wanderers
19/03/2020, 16:59 - Rob;: Hebei Hotspurs
19/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Paulinho now plays for Hebei
19/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: former spurs player no less
19/03/2020, 17:10 - Rob;: Didn't he manage to get to Barca briefly, having gone to china after failing at Spurs?

19/03/2020, 17:23 - David;: Antibody test on the way. Fine.
19/03/2020, 17:29 - Paul;: Next.
19/03/2020, 17:41 - David;: The little gnome they have doing the signing on this one
19/03/2020, 17:43 - Paul;: Rate whitty
19/03/2020, 17:43 - Damian Rumble: I really wish I had photographic evidence from the two years we lived together to challenge this...
19/03/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: Ah jack
19/03/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: Toilet roll hoarding and multiple pack buying
19/03/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: Your PR campaign against the bog roll comes unstuck again
19/03/2020, 17:52 - / James Ball: can we get an antibody test to determine if someone has hoarded bog roll before
19/03/2020, 17:53 - Rob;: Oh yes, that's being fast-tracked as we speak
19/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: Jack is full of bog roll lies. Lie after lie
19/03/2020, 17:54 - David;: So Jack you in fact buy multiple packs
19/03/2020, 17:54 - David;: and of huge size
19/03/2020, 17:54 - Paul;: The damning lies always exposed
19/03/2020, 17:55 - Jack G;: Everyone just instantly believing Damian? He‚Äôs full of shit. This is the first time I‚Äôve ever bought a 24 pack
19/03/2020, 17:56 - Rob;: 'I bought multiple packs but I didn't inhale'
19/03/2020, 17:57 - Paul;: Stories changed to now only ever 1 x 24 pack. All the times you were out buying 6 x 4 packs. Shameful
19/03/2020, 17:58 - Jack G;: Not listening to this anymore. Not accepting anymore questions about bog roll, sorry
19/03/2020, 18:11 - Damian Rumble: I'm pretty sure I say here that I don't have evidence of jack's hording so he's probably right on that one
19/03/2020, 18:11 - / James Ball: you have no evidence *of the hoarding*
19/03/2020, 18:12 - / James Ball: hoarding confirmed
19/03/2020, 18:12 - Paul;: That‚Äôs the way you would read that
19/03/2020, 18:20 - / James Ball: I see no other way to read it
19/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Yeah, there was hoarding that you didn't record
19/03/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: really been thrown under the bus there jack.
19/03/2020, 18:27 - / James Ball: have you got an evidence to contrary?
19/03/2020, 18:27 - Jack G;: What is this, a witch hunt? What happened to innocent until proven guilty
19/03/2020, 18:27 - David;: Like saying 'I wish I had evidence of that time you shat yourself.' 'No, no, of course I wasn't saying that you did shit yourself, just that I wish I had evidence of a hypothetical time when you had'
19/03/2020, 18:28 - Jack G;: As if I would have enough cash to stockpile bog roll as a stupid. More interested in crates of Stella
19/03/2020, 18:28 - Jack G;: Student*
19/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: 'I wish I had kept the blood stained clothes from the day I murdered that woman'; 'What I meant by that was, if I had commited the murder, then I would have kept evidence of it, your honour'
19/03/2020, 18:30 - / James Ball: pretty much, yeah
19/03/2020, 18:30 - / James Ball: important to root out the hoarders among us and then test them to see if they are hoarders any more or if they have repented
19/03/2020, 18:31 - David;: Bog roll restocked now anyway. So you're sitting on 31 rolls for no reason
19/03/2020, 18:31 - Jack G;: Yeah because I‚Äôm not planning on ever taking a shit again
19/03/2020, 18:32 - David;: You panicked
19/03/2020, 18:32 - / James Ball: maybe in July you'll need a restock
19/03/2020, 18:33 - Damian Rumble: This is largely the assumption I was operating under. I would have loved to have thrown jack under a bus by providing photos of him clutching at bog roll as it falls from inside his room.... But alas I am unable to (because it didn't happen)
19/03/2020, 18:37 - David;: How many rolls have you used since you stocked up?
19/03/2020, 18:38 - Paul;: Lol hypothetically wishing for evidence
19/03/2020, 18:39 - Jack G;: 1
19/03/2020, 18:39 - Paul;: How many did you think you‚Äôd have got through?
19/03/2020, 18:40 - Jack G;: 1 or 2
19/03/2020, 18:45 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 18:46 - Rob;: Less than a pound per person though
19/03/2020, 18:46 - / James Ball: a whole cupboard of children's medicine I bet
19/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Because jack has it all
19/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Hence hoarders
19/03/2020, 18:47 - / James Ball: yes a very non sensational sensational headline
19/03/2020, 18:47 - Paul;: >what is hoarding
19/03/2020, 18:51 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 18:54 - / James Ball: rinse nob
19/03/2020, 18:56 - Rob;: I'm partly so jealous of the type of quarantine where you don't have to work. All that wanking I'm missing out on
19/03/2020, 18:56 - Rob;: But also grateful for this ever more perilous employment
19/03/2020, 18:59 - / James Ball: why not  both?
19/03/2020, 19:18 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 19:20 - Paul;: Lol she‚Äôs done well there
19/03/2020, 19:21 - / James Ball: this is you Damo
19/03/2020, 19:21 - Damian Rumble: Well if you infect a whole plane of people what's another 500 going to hurt
19/03/2020, 19:21 - Paul;: 100%
19/03/2020, 19:22 - / James Ball: how's the quarantine going damo? is Boris going to have to enforce lock down because of people flouting the rules?
19/03/2020, 19:23 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure you could refer to me as a socialite
19/03/2020, 19:23 - Damian Rumble: No one is buying that
19/03/2020, 19:54 - / James Ball: So Italy dead then. Worse outbreak than China by some metrics and people still not in total lockdown
19/03/2020, 19:56 - Paul;: Anyone watched tales from earthsea?
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: I read ally he earthsea books as a kid
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: Assuming it's the same
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: Ursula le Guin is a great writer
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: Her adult books are great
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: What's Tales from... on?
19/03/2020, 20:03 - Paul;: Shitflix. Studio ghibli one
19/03/2020, 20:03 - Paul;: Could be huge
19/03/2020, 20:15 - Rob;: Ah. Well. Combining two awesome things.

19/03/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: So perhaps it will slack off
19/03/2020, 22:26 - Paul;: Good point

20/03/2020, 00:12 - Damian Rumble: Surely that's reflective on the time it took to move from China (who quarantined an entire city to stop in spreading) to densely populated Europe (where Boris advised us not to go to the pub)
20/03/2020, 06:32 - Phill: And everyone went anyway. Can't blame everything on a Tory.
20/03/2020, 07:08 - Phill: Could we farm and harvest antibodies from people who have recovered and pump them into everyone?

20/03/2020, 09:21 - Damian Rumble: I thought 'critical' workforce's children could keep going to school?
20/03/2020, 09:23 - Rob;: And schools are meant to still be running today. So I guess it's schools that have shut on their own terms
20/03/2020, 09:23 - Rob;: Which anecdotally is most of them. Every teacher I know has been off since at least weds
20/03/2020, 09:25 - Damian Rumble: So my flatmate who probably has the virus. Her boyfriend came over last night and he left to go to work this morning (he's a sound technician at a uni). I did point out that he should be quarantine but he went anyway
20/03/2020, 09:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Hes an idiot
20/03/2020, 09:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Nursaries

20/03/2020, 12:47 - Jack G;: Complete bs how people are buying multiple kgs of food, honestly they need to start putting restrictions in place formally where you can‚Äôt buy more than x amount of anything
20/03/2020, 12:48 - David;: What would the bog roll limit be?
20/03/2020, 12:48 - Paul;: Otherwise you‚Äôre unable to control yourself without imposed restrictions?

20/03/2020, 13:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
20/03/2020, 13:42 - David;: Question for James. I managed to stand on the left side of this jack while it was plugged in, with I believe the outside of the broke jack now lodged inside the 'A' input. Any thoughts on how one might resolve such a situation?
20/03/2020, 13:43 - David;: *broken
20/03/2020, 13:53 - Phill: Super glue a stick to the bit stuck in there and pull it out. Buy new cable.
20/03/2020, 13:59 - David;: Got a replacement cable. Yeah - do I want to be lobbing super glue into an electrical socket?
20/03/2020, 14:04 - Sam;: SAGE documents out
20/03/2020, 14:04 - Sam;: Social distancing for rest of year advised
20/03/2020, 14:09 - / James Ball: Yes, this does happen quite regularly. The superglue trick might work but you'd need to use a very small amount to avoid splooging it all over the inside and ending up super gluing the broken end in there.
20/03/2020, 14:11 - / James Ball: The only real surefire way of fixing it is to poke it out from the other side or use a very long thin pair of pliers to try and grab the broken jack
20/03/2020, 14:13 - David;: The outside of the socket seems like it would unscrew
20/03/2020, 14:13 - David;: But do I want to be doing that?
20/03/2020, 14:14 - Rob;: But with some alternating of strict measures (like now) and less so (like last week). So we still get our mega benders
20/03/2020, 14:14 - Paul;: The mega benders
20/03/2020, 14:15 - Sam;: Alternating frousts
20/03/2020, 14:15 - Rob;: Like being Demob happy during the war
20/03/2020, 14:16 - Rob;: Get pissed and catch syphilis off an underage French prozzer
20/03/2020, 14:19 - David;: So the 12 weeks was a load of bollocks
20/03/2020, 14:20 - Rob;: Probably 12 weeks for strict measures before alternating?
20/03/2020, 14:20 - Rob;: No one fucking knows anyway, all prediction
20/03/2020, 14:21 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
20/03/2020, 14:23 - David;: How does the poking technique work?
20/03/2020, 14:32 - / James Ball: Usually they aren't covered inside and you can just poke the jack out with something
20/03/2020, 15:18 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
20/03/2020, 15:18 - Rob;: So 1800s
20/03/2020, 15:18 - / James Ball: thumb update. one of my stitches came undone when washing my hands. Just had an early extraction
20/03/2020, 15:25 - David;: Bonus content
20/03/2020, 15:32 - Sam;: We‚Äôre about to do our final bit of panic buying; gin and tonic
20/03/2020, 15:37 - / James Ball: two cases worth, yeah?
20/03/2020, 15:49 - Damian Rumble: Eagerly awaiting the thumb review...
20/03/2020, 16:06 - Sam;: Everything limited to four items. Was allowed 4 1litre gins but only 4 750ml tonics.
20/03/2020, 16:07 - / James Ball: actually hoarding
20/03/2020, 16:08 - Rob;: They're actually suggesting you mix less there
20/03/2020, 16:18 - Paul;: So teachers will just be awarding grades for this year
20/03/2020, 16:22 - Sam;: They want me more pissed
20/03/2020, 16:35 - David;: Lol incentivising incredibly short strong drinking
20/03/2020, 16:36 - David;: Would be great if they took that to extremes. 4 grains of rice or 4 pineapples.
20/03/2020, 16:50 - Damian Rumble: That sounds excessive but then one report I read today suggested we might have to keep these measures for the rest of the year so it case you'll struggle
20/03/2020, 16:55 - Sam;: I‚Äôm going back tomorrow.
20/03/2020, 16:56 - Rob;: But get it in the same ratio again
20/03/2020, 17:15 - Damian Rumble: Government paying 80% of salaries of people who would overwise lose their jobs
20/03/2020, 17:15 - Damian Rumble: Not sure if that covers freelance like @447508112753
20/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: doubt it as I don't have a salary
20/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: no way to prove lost earnings
20/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: although they are very happy to tax me based on previous years earnings and then correct it at the end
20/03/2020, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: No VAT for the next quarter
20/03/2020, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: Paul did you write this economic policy
20/03/2020, 17:19 - Damian Rumble: Universal credit goes up by ¬£1000 per year.
20/03/2020, 17:19 - Damian Rumble: There you go
20/03/2020, 17:21 - / James Ball: must be able to claim UC to get it though
20/03/2020, 17:23 - / James Ball: Economy basically dead after this then
20/03/2020, 17:25 - Damian Rumble: They said something about opening up universal credit to all, but I don't know enough about that system to judge whether it would help or not
20/03/2020, 17:25 - Sam;: You can get SSP. ¬£100 a week
20/03/2020, 17:26 - Sam;: It‚Äôs something I guess
20/03/2020, 17:26 - Damian Rumble: But yeah... Given this could be the case for the rest of the year there is going to be some hefty debt after this
20/03/2020, 17:31 - / James Ball: 50% of GDP extra?
20/03/2020, 17:38 - Paul;: Think we still need that ¬£1k direct
20/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: That would add much more confidence
20/03/2020, 17:41 - / James Ball: ¬£1 available now though
20/03/2020, 17:41 - / James Ball: just not as a cheque
20/03/2020, 17:41 - / James Ball: ¬£1k*

20/03/2020, 18:19 - Phill: Everyone just sitting at home now taking 80% of their salary? What's there to riot about?

20/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Will be wfh for months
20/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Which might actually be quite good
20/03/2020, 18:55 - / James Ball: there will never be full lockdown as they need to keep deliveries, food, manufacturing, healthcare etc going
20/03/2020, 19:00 - Paul;: Apart from those essentials but like in Spain / Italy where you‚Äôre not allowed out
20/03/2020, 19:06 - David;: Don't think so they ruled that out yesterday
20/03/2020, 19:07 - David;: Think it will stay like this
20/03/2020, 19:07 - Paul;: Ah ok. This could be manageable
20/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: Just went for a wander in Edinburgh. People still in some pubs.
20/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: Not great enforcement
20/03/2020, 19:08 - / James Ball: yeah, they'll keep it like this until they need to enforce it
20/03/2020, 19:09 - / James Ball: last drink of the apocalypse
20/03/2020, 19:09 - / James Ball: lots of beer going to waste over this
20/03/2020, 19:10 - David;: Should flog it by the barrell. We could all get huge kegs in to tide us through
20/03/2020, 19:10 - / James Ball: having worked in pubs it will literally just go down the drain if it's not drunk
20/03/2020, 19:11 - David;: Or just serve it takeaway in plastic cups

20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: We are working our way through all the playlists
20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: She's crumbling but I'm refusing to budge.
20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: 15mins to go
20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: Consuming every track.
20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: This is the first significant resistance.
20/03/2020, 22:28 - David;: Nice. Shuffle or original order?
20/03/2020, 22:28 - Phill: Original order
20/03/2020, 22:28 - David;: This is a huge idea.
20/03/2020, 22:28 - Phill: Analysing the composition
20/03/2020, 22:28 - David;: How can that be the track she dislikes in all that? A classic
20/03/2020, 22:29 - David;: There are some much more obscure c.2014 indie b sides on honkington she could legit oppose
20/03/2020, 22:29 - David;: E.e. Peng pong by Erlend Oye
20/03/2020, 22:31 - Phill: But that's the kind of indie/hipster shit that she loves
20/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: She's already noted a paradigm shift from the guitar to the synth.
20/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: Over the years.
20/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: I feel this exercise will bring that sharply into focus.
20/03/2020, 22:33 - David;: Yeah, that's the central drift

21/03/2020, 01:41 - Damian Rumble: BBC News - Coronavirus: Dow erases Trump presidency gains
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51980671
21/03/2020, 08:32 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 08:37 - Rob;: But also not factoring in how many extra people would die of non-corona causes due to less care if corona completely overwhelms the nhs
21/03/2020, 08:38 - Rob;: And it's quite a cold way of looking at it too. When a relative has a year to live, their family don't just go 'well, fuck it then, kill em now'
21/03/2020, 08:57 - Damian Rumble: I think the do nothing model had 500k deaths but I highly doubt that number is purely Coronavirus deaths. @447526575752 of the cases you see. What percentage of victims have serious health conditions that may have resulted in them dying within the year any way?
21/03/2020, 09:00 - Hamish Sinclair: I think alot of non Corona virus deaths will be accelerated. We are stopping giving most people chemotherapy for non curable conditions so you would expect cancer survival statistics to be much higher in the next 6months
21/03/2020, 09:19 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I guess the problem is that all those yearly deaths are coming at the same time rather than spread throughout the year.
21/03/2020, 09:34 - David;: That's quite an oversight
21/03/2020, 09:38 - Paul;: You‚Äôd have thought you‚Äôd want that mapped in
21/03/2020, 09:39 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm not sure the biggest concern about Coronavirus is necessarily the mortality rate of the virus itself. We are already resigned to the fact that 80% will get it
21/03/2020, 09:40 - Hamish Sinclair: The biggest concern is is overwhelms health  systems and then the mortality rate of Coronavirus and other conditions will rise exponentially
21/03/2020, 09:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Your chance of surviving a major car accident for example is much lower if all the operating theatres are full of covid patients on ventilators and the surgeon is at home I'll with symptoms
21/03/2020, 09:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Possibly yes, front loading your normal annual deaths, but by doing so increase the mortality of every other condition
21/03/2020, 09:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Also current mortality rate of inpatient covid admissions over 70years of age is 100% (albeit small numbers at this time)
21/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: But then I was thinking you need to map all the deaths directly or indirectly caused by the interventions. Suicides, obesity from no one doing excercise etc.
21/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: Ah. What? Everyone over 70 admitted to hospital has died?
21/03/2020, 09:46 - David;: People probably drinking a lot more booze. Hence liver problems down the line
21/03/2020, 09:51 - David;: And, the deaths in the years to come from the economic effect of the interventions. Directly: less funding for the NHS next decade as we have a smaller tax base. Indirectly: people poorer and/or unemployed so eat less healthily, excercise less, mental health problems etc.
21/03/2020, 09:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Who has tested positive with covid. Small numbers n<20 from frimley park
21/03/2020, 10:22 - Phill: Thanks for the card samboo
21/03/2020, 10:28 - David;: Wait but I thought almost all of the c150 deaths from it have been over 70?
21/03/2020, 10:28 - Phill: I think he means at his specific hospital
21/03/2020, 10:29 - David;: Right. Yeah
21/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: Fuck. c.1,500 people died yesterday worldwide
21/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: From 10,000 to 11,509 in a day
21/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: *11,500
21/03/2020, 10:39 - / James Ball: but we are seeing the death wave from everyone who got sick 5 days ago
21/03/2020, 10:40 - / James Ball: with luck cases should level off in a few days once the impact of the social distancing is felt, however deaths will continue to climb in the interim
21/03/2020, 10:42 - Rob;: When did Italy lock down? Was it 2 weeks ago? Deaths per day still increasing
21/03/2020, 10:43 - / James Ball: 12th March?
21/03/2020, 10:43 - Phill: Yeah but they've all been slobbering over each other. Kissing to greet, not respecting personal space etc. Classic Italians. British are more socially distant by nature.
21/03/2020, 10:44 - Paul;: Think this does have a lot to do with it
21/03/2020, 10:44 - Paul;: More than people are appreciating
21/03/2020, 10:45 - / James Ball: Yeah it has a lot to do with it, Italians not sticking to their quarantine and a generally older population
21/03/2020, 10:46 - / James Ball: we shouldn't be complacent though as there've been plenty of people going into work for a long time that carrying it
21/03/2020, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Hospitals are preparing for surge in cases nationally within 2 weeks
21/03/2020, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: London disproportionately affected at the moment
21/03/2020, 10:55 - Stefan;: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says
The average age of deaths in Italy is 80, and virtually all had underlying conditions
21/03/2020, 10:56 - Stefan;: Seems they're particularly fucked with a very old population and multi-generational households the norm, so young people catch it and then pass it to grandparents
21/03/2020, 10:58 - David;: Yes, that social structure with extended family homes is fucking them
21/03/2020, 11:00 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 11:00 - David;: Not really squashing the sombrero
21/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Would be interesting to see that curve by region. My understanding is that london is outstripping the rest of the country, partly due to population density but also through lack of adherence to social distencing
21/03/2020, 11:03 - David;: Yeah - well that graph is globally as well not even UK
21/03/2020, 11:03 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 11:03 - David;: This is UK
21/03/2020, 11:08 - Damian Rumble: This issue very useful
21/03/2020, 11:11 - Damian Rumble: Is*
21/03/2020, 11:12 - Damian Rumble: So basically the answer here is 99%
21/03/2020, 11:16 - Hamish Sinclair: No not neccesarily
21/03/2020, 11:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Alot of the people who have died had underlying diabetes, heart disease etc, but would not neccesarily a year from death
21/03/2020, 11:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, just found out someone I saw yesterday has tested positive, it's only a matter of time now
21/03/2020, 11:20 - / James Ball: Shit, self isolation now?
21/03/2020, 11:22 - Hamish Sinclair: No, carry on until develop symptoms
21/03/2020, 11:22 - Paul;: Then 7 or 14 days isolation?
21/03/2020, 11:23 - Hamish Sinclair: I'll need to see what the up to date guidance is
21/03/2020, 11:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Changes daily it seems
21/03/2020, 11:23 - David;: That seems fucked. Won't you just be transmitting to other NHS workers in the meantime?
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Possibly
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: If I'm infected
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: But I might not be
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: And if you tested me now and it was negative then it might be false
21/03/2020, 11:24 - David;: How quickly can you get tested now?
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: As all virus have an incubation period
21/03/2020, 11:25 - Hamish Sinclair: I wont be able to get tested unless I need hospital admission
21/03/2020, 11:25 - David;: Ah.
21/03/2020, 11:25 - Hamish Sinclair: But trusts are arguing with the government that we need to
21/03/2020, 11:25 - David;: So you have to develop symptoms to be isolated now
21/03/2020, 11:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, or live with someone with symptoms
21/03/2020, 11:25 - David;: Yeah this seems like a not great situation.
21/03/2020, 11:26 - David;: It will be going around the NHS quickly with people who haven't been tested and currently asymptomatic
21/03/2020, 11:26 - David;: I suppose if the NHS can develop its own mini herd immunity before the rest of the country that could be okay?
21/03/2020, 11:27 - Paul;: The nhs herd
21/03/2020, 11:28 - / James Ball: The segregation of health and state
21/03/2020, 11:29 - Hamish Sinclair: The social pariahs
21/03/2020, 11:30 - / James Ball: we probably owe Hamish a pint after this
21/03/2020, 11:31 - Hamish Sinclair: I believe phil has a surplus currently
21/03/2020, 11:33 - David;: Is work noticeably busier already or is it just the sense of a shit storm coming
21/03/2020, 11:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Weirdly emptied out a bit as all consultation have moved to telephone a d people are staying away
21/03/2020, 11:35 - Hamish Sinclair: And then within the designated covid isolated areas its carnage
21/03/2020, 11:35 - David;: Are you away from that?
21/03/2020, 11:35 - Hamish Sinclair: But majority of the cases within that are suspected, bot confirmed
21/03/2020, 11:36 - Hamish Sinclair: So dont think we have actually had the proper surge in cases yet, we are just putting everyone who would have otherwise come I  with a pneumonia in one place
21/03/2020, 11:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes but have to see cancer patients admitted to those areas
21/03/2020, 11:56 - / James Ball: gumped a lot of stilton last night. paying for it now
21/03/2020, 11:56 - Paul;: The gout
21/03/2020, 11:56 - / James Ball: large amount of stilton gas emerging
21/03/2020, 11:57 - / James Ball: beef stew with dumplings, spring greens, wine, beer, stilton. Gout inevitable
21/03/2020, 12:06 - David;: Ah yeah. The cut load on that is weighty
21/03/2020, 12:06 - David;: *gut
21/03/2020, 12:06 - David;: Lot of bowel admin there
21/03/2020, 12:07 - David;: Have we thought about all the extra gout deaths from self-isolation frousts?
21/03/2020, 12:27 - David;: I feel like deliveroo drivers have suddenly become key workers
21/03/2020, 12:33 - Paul;: New movie releases now available on Amazon by the looks of it
21/03/2020, 12:34 - Paul;: Seeing as can‚Äôt watch in the cinema
21/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: Yeah saw that they are doing streaming releases of new films
21/03/2020, 12:49 - / James Ball: I wonder if that will stick after the current apocalypse
21/03/2020, 13:01 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 13:01 - Paul;: Kind of johnned it for themselves there

21/03/2020, 15:52 - Phill: >this isn't about profit
21/03/2020, 15:52 - David;: So actually being used as hard currency now. Bog rolls for beer exchange rate
21/03/2020, 15:52 - Phill: >selling scarce items
21/03/2020, 15:53 - David;: I also loled at that. 'its about keeping our staff busy'. Bet they fucking love that. This makes us no money we're just so spiteful that we can't bear to simply give you the time off.
21/03/2020, 15:54 - David;: I'd rather you sold our dwindling shitty stock at no profit to us than give you some extra leisure time.
21/03/2020, 15:57 - Phill: @jack how many pints of roll you got left now?
21/03/2020, 15:58 - Jack G;: 29 pints going by this exchange rate?
21/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Was thinking we could synchronise re-watch withnail and I at some point. Start at the same time. Drink when withnail drinks.
21/03/2020, 16:41 - Phill: Yeah yeah yeah

21/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Is this the brewing kit firing up?
21/03/2020, 17:03 - David;: Father James' Old Musty Ale.
21/03/2020, 17:07 - Paul;: 800 more dead in Italy past 24 hrs
21/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: Yep. Ivan only smell malt now
21/03/2020, 17:11 - David;: Old Malty
21/03/2020, 17:20 - / James Ball: I can*
21/03/2020, 17:20 - / James Ball: Woodfordes Wherry is the beer
21/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: What do you have to do
21/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: Is it just a yeast/hop mix you add water to?
21/03/2020, 17:37 - / James Ball: I wasn't sure but essentially it came with two massive cans of molasses type malt
21/03/2020, 17:37 - / James Ball: mixed it all into the water after sterilising and added yeast
21/03/2020, 17:38 - David;: Will it get stronger the longer you leave it?
21/03/2020, 17:38 - / James Ball: nah it will run out of energy
21/03/2020, 17:39 - David;: How long till you can drink?
21/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: theoretically two weeks but will probably leave for a bit to mature in the big cask
21/03/2020, 17:42 - / James Ball: should end up being a malty dark ale
21/03/2020, 17:44 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 17:44 - / James Ball: Just squatting in the bathroom stirring my beer bucket
21/03/2020, 17:45 - David;: Have you considered taking up pipe smoking?
21/03/2020, 17:54 - Rob;: I walked to my office to pick up some stuff before it closes indefinitely today. Zone 2 London is really lively, no one in pubs but lot of people out on walks keeping their distance. Changes dramatically as soon as you get into zone 1. Absolute ghost town there, except for the homeless people, who are getting really desperate
21/03/2020, 17:55 - Rob;: They've basically had their support network of workers and tourists cut off completely
21/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Yeah. They will have to migrate out to residential districts? Rely on walkers.
21/03/2020, 17:57 - Stefan;: We cycled through Hackney/Walthamstow marshes and it was full of people
21/03/2020, 17:57 - Stefan;: Possibly counterproductive if everyone goes outside to the same place at once
21/03/2020, 17:58 - Rob;: Yeah I expect they will. They are quite distributed throughout London generally any way, but particularly congregate around whee I work on the strand as there are a lot of shelters and charity initiatives around there as well as tourists
21/03/2020, 17:58 - David;: Edinburgh was buzzing yesterday. In the parks, nice weather and all the children starting a 6 month holiday. End of term atmosphere. No social distancing
21/03/2020, 17:58 - Rob;: Surely it's a much reduced risk congregating in the open air though? In an unstructured way with small groups too
21/03/2020, 18:00 - David;: Less surfaces to transmit I guess and people not touching things.
21/03/2020, 18:00 - Rob;: Yeah, and you're not cramming in. Naturally more distanced
21/03/2020, 18:00 - David;: Our death rate is extremely high. Almost as many deaths as US with far less cases.
21/03/2020, 18:01 - Rob;: So perhaps we have far more cases?
21/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: We‚Äôre not doing much testing
21/03/2020, 18:02 - David;: Yeah I think our testing is much worse
21/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: Italy just getting destroyed
21/03/2020, 18:02 - David;: Deaths is a better metric. You don't miss any deaths but you miss lots of cases
21/03/2020, 18:03 - Stefan;: It does suggest the virus is far more widespread already than we thought
21/03/2020, 18:04 - Phill: Maybe this virus been around for months and no one knew? ü§î
21/03/2020, 18:04 - David;: At least the private hospitals are chipping in now. Ridiculous that hadn't happened already
21/03/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: I was reading about how Italy got most of its early cases from countries no one new had it yet, like Germany, while it was focusing exclusively on people coming in from China
21/03/2020, 18:33 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 18:33 - Hamish Sinclair: This is quite  a good discussion about the virus
21/03/2020, 18:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Albeit with annoying American accents
21/03/2020, 18:44 - Paul;: Now saying shitting yourself could be a sign of Coronavirus
21/03/2020, 18:46 - David;: So we've had it for years?
21/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Making it up as they go along
21/03/2020, 18:47 - David;: Wasn't there a chart saying shitting definitely nothing to do with it?
21/03/2020, 18:48 - Paul;: Yep now it turns out everyone was shitting themselves
21/03/2020, 18:48 - Paul;: Very coy and anal
21/03/2020, 18:51 - Phill: Welllll my guts have been in bits
21/03/2020, 18:52 - David;: My guts are a mess but pretty sure that's mostly to do with the chilli and wine.
21/03/2020, 19:06 - Paul;: But it could be the vid
21/03/2020, 19:14 - David;: Only if produces ring burn exactly identical to chilli slops
21/03/2020, 19:21 - Rob;: Maybe they realised everyone is constantly shitting awfully. Like warning that walking is a symptom, won't narrow it down at all.
21/03/2020, 19:26 - David;: Would lead to a lot of false positives yes. If we all have to get tested whenever we have sloppy shit. I'd tested every time I had a coffee.
21/03/2020, 19:26 - Paul;: Lol how much is coffee ruining you? I get struck 1 in 5 times I think
21/03/2020, 19:28 - David;: Depends. Can deal well with real cafetiere coffee past 12 o'clock. But in the morning or instant coffee then it's a write off
21/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: Prem to come back before end of restrictions
21/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: Behind closed doors televised games

21/03/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: They have run out?
21/03/2020, 21:35 - David;: No fresh stuff at all
21/03/2020, 21:36 - David;: No staples, running low on sauces etc.
21/03/2020, 21:36 - David;: Junk food holding up fine. Sweets, crisps etc. no problem
21/03/2020, 21:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Ready made sandwiches
21/03/2020, 21:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Lots of ready made sandwiches presumably because people no longer buying onbeay to work
21/03/2020, 22:06 - David;: Yeah, or people are worried that people have touched them while prepping?
21/03/2020, 22:07 - David;: they want forms of food that haven't seen a human in months - your pasta sauces, your tinned hot dogs.
21/03/2020, 22:52 - David;: The decline from actual MotD to essentially 3 blokes chatting over a glass of wine is stark

22/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: If you add yeast to piss. Viable drink?

22/03/2020, 16:13 - David;: Nice cheery message
22/03/2020, 16:13 - David;: Everyone is being so nice to each other.
22/03/2020, 16:14 - Damian Rumble: Maybe they were referring to the coast... Because the end of the land is indeed very near... Before it becomes the sea
22/03/2020, 16:15 - David;: It feels like everyone in the country is acting as if they had a huge row with each other last night and some dark shit was said and are now being really polite and gentle to make up for it
22/03/2020, 16:39 - David;: It's a golden age for ticket to ride online. So many players in the forum. Can get a game instantly.
22/03/2020, 16:44 - Rob;: Did not know there was an online version
22/03/2020, 16:46 - Paul;: It‚Äôs where the hardcore play
22/03/2020, 16:54 - David;: It's get very intense. Deep strategy
22/03/2020, 17:03 - Sam;: Daily briefing on the way..
22/03/2020, 17:04 - Jack G;: Stronger enforcement incoming?
22/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Everyone just frousting down?
22/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Alcoholism is definitely going to skyrocket
22/03/2020, 17:13 - David;: Old people going to get screwed
22/03/2020, 17:19 - Rob;: Seems like no for now
22/03/2020, 17:19 - Paul;: Rather dull update
22/03/2020, 17:20 - Jack G;: Tories cut police numbers so much they don‚Äôt have enough resource to do much enforcement
22/03/2020, 17:20 - David;: Thought the 12 week thing had already been implemented?
22/03/2020, 17:21 - Jack G;: They‚Äôre all getting a letter now though Dave, will make all the difference...
22/03/2020, 17:23 - David;: Also housemates and carers popping in and out all the time anyway.
22/03/2020, 17:23 - Paul;: Yeah you‚Äôd have thought they‚Äôd need to take better measures
22/03/2020, 17:24 - Paul;: How many police would you need to enforce 1.5m people?!?
22/03/2020, 17:24 - Paul;: I don‚Äôt think it makes a huge difference
22/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: As they‚Äôre so specific
22/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: Almost a 1 for 1 required
22/03/2020, 17:25 - Jack G;: It‚Äôs not just these 1.5 million people though, loads of others ignoring the advice. You‚Äôd think these most vulnerable would need the least amount of enforcing considering the huge risk to them
22/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: You just can‚Äôt help Damian‚Äôs more police or not
22/03/2020, 17:30 - / James Ball: Just need to make an example of a few people and it will help

22/03/2020, 17:32 - Paul;: Null and voiding the season still on the cards
22/03/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: I wonder how much they will have factored in the effect that the measures taken will have on other hospitalisations - fewer flu cases in the elderly, less strain on A&E as the pubs are closed and events are off etc
22/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: That was a big factor on cancelling events?
22/03/2020, 17:55 - David;: Bit of a nothing update
22/03/2020, 17:56 - Jack G;: Interesting to hear that currently 12% of ICU beds are being taken up by COVID patients. Seems high for this point of the epidemic?
22/03/2020, 17:58 - David;: Close to killing the same number as the first day of the Somme globally now.

22/03/2020, 19:58 - David;: That fucking song.
22/03/2020, 19:59 - Rob;: Yeah. Never want to hear it again
22/03/2020, 19:59 - Paul;: Good how irrelevant all the celebrities become during a pandemic. Did you see they did a highly embarrassing rendition of imagine
22/03/2020, 20:00 - Rob;: >The idea that they thought they were helping with that
22/03/2020, 20:01 - Paul;: Great how out of touch they are. Slowly getting more and more irrelevant
22/03/2020, 20:01 - Paul;: Must be driving them mad
22/03/2020, 20:02 - David;: Fuck off. Hopefully this burst the shitty b celebrity bubble.
22/03/2020, 20:02 - David;: Reality TV must finally be gone after this.
22/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51959070
22/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: Of course the bbc is fawning over them
22/03/2020, 20:08 - David;: Any good films out on streaming then?
22/03/2020, 20:14 - David;: Actually very shit
22/03/2020, 20:14 - Paul;: Yeah incredibly shit
22/03/2020, 20:14 - David;: Looked it up on youtube. Such an annoying way of singing
22/03/2020, 20:15 - David;: We'll no longer be able to afford the celebrity class after the pandemic.
22/03/2020, 20:15 - David;: They'll have to get proper jobs again
22/03/2020, 20:18 - Paul;: Will be good to get rid of them
22/03/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: I agree. But how do we stop people become celebrities from the bits of culture we like?
22/03/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: Like the people in films
22/03/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: Are we just saying: thanks for being in the films. There's no money left now thanks to the virus. Have a few thousand pounds like everyone else
22/03/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: I'm on board with that
22/03/2020, 20:21 - Paul;: Yeah have to reduce salaries
22/03/2020, 20:21 - Paul;: Here‚Äôs a tenner
22/03/2020, 20:21 - Rob;: That is sort of what happened to most musicians already
22/03/2020, 20:23 - David;: Yeah. Still make the film's we'll just charge you an average wage for it and not hold you up as gods to be revered. Also trim it down a lot, like in the way we are shedding the minor royals and only keeping the direct line of accession.
22/03/2020, 20:24 - David;: Maybe make 12 really good films a year. You get one a month.
22/03/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: The reality tv celebs will be feeling it the worst. They‚Äôll start doing some ridiculous things to stay relevant soon
22/03/2020, 20:27 - Rob;: I would like at least 24 films a year
22/03/2020, 20:27 - Rob;: Like what if two in a row are The Lady in the Van
22/03/2020, 20:27 - Paul;: Lol
22/03/2020, 20:28 - David;: Nah you get 1 a month. Remember we still have all the film's already made.
22/03/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: None of them are allowed to be cgi either. I want a return to animatronics
22/03/2020, 20:29 - Rob;: In the future no one will be able to make a film about anything but staying inside a house, as that's all they know
22/03/2020, 20:29 - Rob;: And Parasite's already done that
22/03/2020, 20:30 - Rob;: 12 films a year. All of them about working from home
22/03/2020, 20:33 - Paul;: Always filmed from 3rd person so you only see back of heads
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: What else can we scrap
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: The great pandemic reset
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: F1
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: First to go
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: Hasn‚Äôt impacted at all by it not being on
22/03/2020, 20:44 - Rob;: Going to work 5 days a week might not come back. Almost every company will find itself with the infrastructure and precedent to let people work from home
22/03/2020, 20:45 - Rob;: Could dampen down rush hour and make commute time less important in properly prices. Might open up pockets of redevelopment as people move to cheaper areas
22/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: There‚Äôs been no advantage of me going into work so far compared to what I can do from home
22/03/2020, 20:47 - Rob;: Fucks me a bit, but that's more to do with their shit server not handling the number of vpn requests. I do miss it though. I'd carved myself an extremely unprofessional little niche
22/03/2020, 20:48 - Paul;: Your unprofessional niche?
22/03/2020, 20:48 - Rob;: Used to mercilessly create any chaos I could
22/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: Got very bored a couple of years ago and entertain myself by just fucking shit up in very minor ways
22/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: Lol such as
22/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: You‚Äôre a saboteur
22/03/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: Every work birthday card has an inappropriately worded message from the same senior guy in it

Many bit of paper in the printer will just have 'fuck you' written on the back of them. Same for random pages in the work notebooks. Have been doing a good line in seemingly real work announcements, like fake employee of the month things
22/03/2020, 20:56 - Rob;: Have developed a little slot on the window everyone gazes out of while waiting for the printer, will normally be a cartoon or joke or something. Became quite popular.
22/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Lol what do you mean a little slot? Like your own prime time tv slot for a cartoon
22/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Had adoring fans?
22/03/2020, 21:00 - Rob;: Just a spot for post its on the window, but you'd hear people talking about it around the office
22/03/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: Not deco obscenia?
22/03/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: No, safe for work, but often anti-establishment
22/03/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: No ones raised the issue of the fuck you on the paper?
22/03/2020, 21:07 - Rob;: Not so far
22/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Do you not think they‚Äôd terminate employment if they traced it back to you?
22/03/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Nah
22/03/2020, 21:11 - Paul;: Rob ‚ÄòFuck you‚Äô Goodway
22/03/2020, 21:37 - David;: Was the thing about warmer weather bollocks then?
22/03/2020, 21:50 - Paul;: I think we‚Äôve got a cold wave for the next week or 2

23/03/2020, 12:33 - David;: Yeah going to save lives overall
23/03/2020, 12:35 - Paul;: The IOC has given itself four weeks to decide on the future of the event.

Options include a delay of several months or - more probably - a year. The IOC says cancellation is "not on the agenda". A "scaled-down" Games will also be considered.
23/03/2020, 12:35 - Paul;: really pushing to keep the olympics on

23/03/2020, 13:21 - Paul;: with 25k people ahead of you for servicing the area around eynsham?
23/03/2020, 13:23 - / James Ball: Correct although the website is national they don't service the whole country
23/03/2020, 13:23 - Paul;: how desperate are you to get in touch with the milkman?
23/03/2020, 13:24 - / James Ball: Not very. I was absent mindedly just going to check what they still had in stock

23/03/2020, 13:45 - Damian Rumble: Bring an all new meaning to "20/20 hindsight"
23/03/2020, 14:22 - David;: Fortunately we set up weekly milk and veg deliveries months ago. Feeling pretty good about that decision now.
23/03/2020, 14:33 - Paul;: think supply chains should start evening out this week / next now all the panic buyers / hoarders (jack) have months of supply
23/03/2020, 14:35 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
23/03/2020, 14:37 - Jack G;: Our Asda has loads of stuff in today. Must have had a delivery in the morning, seems like you‚Äôre right.
23/03/2020, 14:39 - Jack G;: Also if all restaurants/pubs are shut surely that wholesale stock could be diverted to supermarkets?
23/03/2020, 14:41 - Paul;: yes some of that will be diverted into peoples homes
23/03/2020, 14:41 - Paul;: as no one going out to eat
23/03/2020, 14:50 - David;: Can't be flogging artisinally sourced scallops for mitchelin starred restaurant chefs down Lidl though.

23/03/2020, 14:52 - David;: Suddenly lots of bulk pizza dough flour, sirloin steaks etc. hitting the shelves?

23/03/2020, 15:39 - Paul;: *were
23/03/2020, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Finally. If brexit can't rid of the foreigners maybe a health crisis and breakdown our basic way of life will do the trick...

23/03/2020, 17:59 - Paul;: Jack how many hens you got at home?
23/03/2020, 17:59 - David;: I must buy hens. The most vital thing right now is to be egg self-sufficient

23/03/2020, 18:01 - David;: they are increasing at 8.1%, down from 9%
23/03/2020, 18:02 - / James Ball: It increased 8.1% from previous day's figure
23/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: It's badly phrased there should be a % sign after both numbers
23/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: otherwise the first number could be read as an integer
23/03/2020, 18:06 - / James Ball: The BBC, badly phrased?

23/03/2020, 20:09 - David;: What I'd like is for a prem game to happen days after all the squads come out of isolation. So you'd see a game with elite players but no carefully prepared game plans or very well drilled formations etc.

23/03/2020, 20:42 - Sam;: No handovers he‚Äôs just got to deal with it all himself.
23/03/2020, 20:43 - Paul;: This seems like a more striking financial crisis than the last one
23/03/2020, 20:44 - Sam;: Yeah has to be
23/03/2020, 20:45 - David;: This has fucked the real economy first not the financial sector. So mass unemployment
23/03/2020, 20:45 - Paul;: Good point there deviiiid
23/03/2020, 20:45 - David;: You can't fully QE your way out of it. Plus they had already used up a lot of monetary policy levers by not normalising interest rates.
23/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: Wonder what you can do next
23/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: No one will be hiring
23/03/2020, 20:46 - David;: Has to be fiscal stimulus
23/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: Need that 1k real bad
23/03/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: People will be too afraid to spend though
23/03/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: The psyche has changed which you can‚Äôt fiscally stimulate
23/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: No point doing it now. Has to be timed for when we are exiting the lockdown measures to boost confidence and demand
23/03/2020, 20:50 - Sam;: Still stuff about, I‚Äôm talking to a recruitment firm called 923 Jobs about a couple of roles in Oxford. Check them out Paul.

23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: This is going to be a long dull lockdown
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: In for the long haul
23/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: The long dark froust of the soul
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: With the parents
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: No boozing
23/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: Why no boozing?
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: They just don‚Äôt like boozing
23/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: But you can just quietly booze in the corner?
23/03/2020, 20:56 - Damian Rumble: Interests rates already at 0.1%. already maxed out the levers for improving the economy. Going to be soo much borrowing that's really going to really drive up inflation
23/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: We'll probably have to start fermenting our own piss. Best to start now.
23/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Give us our ¬£1k
23/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: It‚Äôs the only logical conclusion
23/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: It doesn't cause inflation when the economy is so far below capacity.
23/03/2020, 21:00 - Damian Rumble: Surely borrowing = QE = inflation
23/03/2020, 21:01 - David;: None of those things necessarily equals the other
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: Money = Money Dave
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: Gnome represents Gnome
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: Brown = brown
23/03/2020, 21:05 - David;: Public sector borrowing can be done either via QE or through open bond markets. QE basically involves adding new money to bank of england computers and using that to buy public, financial sector or corporate debt. That would only create inflation if their is no slack in the economy and it is already running at full capacity so it translates to higher prices. But now, when there is going to be a huge slack in capacity and mass unemployment it would stimulate demand and avoid companies going bust.
23/03/2020, 21:06 - David;: Also the interest payments on additional government debt are going to be tiny at the moment as interest rates are virtually zero. And you are unlikely to get punished with capital outflow because all other countries are doing exactly the same thing so there is nowhere else for capital to go. So it's pretty much risk free.
23/03/2020, 21:07 - David;: This is as close to the exact situation Keynesian economics models as you can get.
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Give everyone ¬£100k?
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Or a little lottery each week
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: That would be fun
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Lots of prizes. Everyone‚Äôs a winner

23/03/2020, 21:28 - David;: Wait what is he trying to suggest that doesnt mean people should stay at home?
23/03/2020, 21:29 - Phill: He's basically trying everything he can to keep people on building sites working
23/03/2020, 21:29 - Phill: All my staff have called to say they won't be in tomorrow
23/03/2020, 21:30 - David;: Obvs

23/03/2020, 21:31 - David;: He is Cnut
23/03/2020, 21:33 - Paul;: That‚Äôs what sambos old boss was saying
23/03/2020, 21:33 - Paul;: He said he had a mate in the nhs who told him to ignore government advice
23/03/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: So my phone battery died while we were moving and I couldn't find where I'd packed my charger until just now
23/03/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: Welcome to the locky
23/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Full on lockdown?
23/03/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: Depends how you interpreted it
23/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Glad I got here, but fucking hell do I not have all the essentials. Mattress, sofa and internet all meant to be coming soon, but will this fuck that?
23/03/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: Yeah this could be a big fucker but deliveries should still continue
23/03/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: You can no longer go to a shop to buy anything non food
23/03/2020, 21:43 - David;: Lol that's a great situation to enter the lockdown in
23/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: Keeps things interesting
23/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: The opposite of hoarding. Stripping down everything in preperatio.
23/03/2020, 21:45 - / James Ball: Welcome to the no internet club
23/03/2020, 21:46 - Paul;: It‚Äôs more exclusive than redundancy club
23/03/2020, 22:00 - / James Ball: Most exclusive is currently the no furniture club
23/03/2020, 22:00 - Rob;: Well, if I can't get back to my old flat for my work Mac, which I deemed to valuable to load into a huge van, I perhaps will be in the redundancy club too
23/03/2020, 22:02 - Rob;: And the no kettle club, population: me
23/03/2020, 22:08 - / James Ball: Well there's always the government meat raffle to look forward to
23/03/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Yeah would enjoy that
23/03/2020, 22:08 - / James Ball: Might get a sausage. Might get a spatchcock. Who knows
23/03/2020, 22:09 - Phill: Why not just furlough you?
23/03/2020, 22:16 - Phill: Love that 7 days ago the strategy was to infect as many people as possible to establish herd immunity
23/03/2020, 22:16 - Paul;: I liked being part of the herd
23/03/2020, 22:22 - / James Ball: #bringbacktheherd

24/03/2020, 08:14 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 08:15 - Phill: Lol all our site staff have basically said fuck off they aren't going to site
24/03/2020, 08:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Lol, legally does your company still have to pay them?
24/03/2020, 08:17 - Phill: No, but the moral impacts of not doing so are shit. Also if we don't pay now they won't hang around afterwards when we'll need them
24/03/2020, 08:18 - Phill: It's stupid, there's thousands of grotty men working closely together in enclosed spaces in London on sites and they're open. It's also a who blinks first game unless the govt order shutdown because whoever delays the work is liable for damages
24/03/2020, 08:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Should just stop work for 2 weeks
24/03/2020, 09:12 - Damian Rumble: Surely the government ordered it so they are liable
24/03/2020, 09:12 - David;: But they haven't ordered it - that's the whole point?
24/03/2020, 09:15 - Phill: Govt haven't ordered anything and a minister immediately afterwards said sites would remain open
24/03/2020, 09:18 - David;: How do you social distance to someone you're working in a building team with?
24/03/2020, 09:21 - Phill: Just try your best to work apart - problem is all London sites are crowded places in enclosed areas
24/03/2020, 09:22 - David;: I don't get how food shopping 'as little as possible' corresponds to the advice not to hoard/panic buy. It's by shopping often that you don't need to stock up
24/03/2020, 09:23 - David;: So am I now doing my duty to panic buy and then bed down?
24/03/2020, 09:25 - Rob;: Also, inner city populations are closer to smaller supermarkets with small stock and no trolleys. Hard to get a full week's shop there at once
24/03/2020, 09:25 - Jack G;: Just been out to get the bins back in. Does that count as my daily allotted exercise?
24/03/2020, 09:25 - Phill: Yeah you're not allowed out again
24/03/2020, 09:26 - Jack G;: Lol
24/03/2020, 09:26 - Jack G;: Wasn‚Äôt planning to anyway, bedding in
24/03/2020, 09:27 - David;: Haha. Yeah also don't step outside to collect a parcel that will use up your trip out
24/03/2020, 09:27 - Phill: Sank a bottle of red wine last night after announcement - my arse this morning.
24/03/2020, 09:31 - / James Ball: Particularly rancid I expect. What was the food load?
24/03/2020, 09:31 - David;: The thirst as well. Desert mouth. What was the tannin structure like?
24/03/2020, 09:32 - David;: Can get those furry tannin reds that really hang around in your mouth
24/03/2020, 09:38 - Phill: Food was courgette pasta with ricotta
24/03/2020, 09:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 09:40 - David;: Peaked in Italy
24/03/2020, 09:41 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 09:42 - David;: Lol
24/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: Could get a sweepy going on the Italy daily death rate. Keep life interesting in the lock down
24/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: Give Paul his lottery
24/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: Ricotta won't be helping the arse
24/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: Was hoping for prolonged exponential growth in Italy
24/03/2020, 09:46 - / James Ball: Could just be the calm before the storm

24/03/2020, 09:48 - / James Ball: Welllll. Newsworthy isn't it
24/03/2020, 09:48 - / James Ball: Good bit of news
24/03/2020, 09:49 - David;: Yeah, it will seem a bit of a Damo squib if we do all this over c. 6000 deaths. Less than normal seasonal flu deaths per year.
24/03/2020, 09:49 - David;: That's the problem if the strategy suceeds it looks like an over-reaction
24/03/2020, 09:49 - David;: *damp
24/03/2020, 09:53 - David;: Death rate sweepy? I go 560.
24/03/2020, 09:54 - / James Ball: 560 total in UK today?
24/03/2020, 09:55 - David;: Nah for Italy today
24/03/2020, 09:59 - / James Ball: Got to check numbers first
24/03/2020, 10:04 - / James Ball: To get *dat* line of best fit on the bell curve I reckon lower. More like 520
24/03/2020, 10:04 - / James Ball: Unless there's a second wave
24/03/2020, 10:06 - David;: James goes 520
24/03/2020, 10:06 - David;: In the sweepy
24/03/2020, 10:13 - Phill: Tfw I've been WFH for over a week and now everyone is calling for advice on how to set shit up
24/03/2020, 10:13 - Phill: Godlike.
24/03/2020, 10:17 - Damian Rumble: 540
24/03/2020, 10:19 - / James Ball: Sneaking in between. Very much a weasel or stoat. A pine marten if you will
24/03/2020, 10:23 - Damian Rumble: Tbh the pine marten a quite a good spirit animal for me.
24/03/2020, 10:25 - / James Ball: My parents were staying in a holiday cottage in Scotland that had a daily pine marten visit. It just ate peanut butter sandwiches

24/03/2020, 10:35 - David;: Should probably make it in increments of 10
24/03/2020, 10:36 - / James Ball: Nahh. Good to get the precision in
24/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: Yeah, but someone could be trolled if someone goes one above and someone else one below. You're left with only that exact number possible. Increments of 5?
24/03/2020, 10:39 - / James Ball: There's no way it won't come down to one exact number
24/03/2020, 10:40 - David;: Yeah. But say you go 100. I go 101. Paul goes 99. We would both have a huge range left to us and you would need it to be 100 exactly.
24/03/2020, 10:40 - / James Ball: Then I would have had to have chosen well
24/03/2020, 10:41 - David;: Lol, fine.
24/03/2020, 10:41 - David;: As you were then
24/03/2020, 10:41 - / James Ball: Lol. Currently only Sambo and dePaul trolling each other
24/03/2020, 10:42 - David;: Yeah, Paul got a decent range up to James as well.
24/03/2020, 10:42 - Stefan;: 650
24/03/2020, 10:42 - Stefan;: I'm not calling a sustained drop in death rate just yet
24/03/2020, 10:42 - / James Ball: Ooof go big or go home eh
24/03/2020, 10:43 - Phill: 591
24/03/2020, 10:43 - Stefan;: Only locked down 2 weeks ago, takes around 1 month from a new infection to death

24/03/2020, 10:46 - / James Ball: They'll probably all recover.

24/03/2020, 10:56 - Rob;: The guy said he expects this to be his last day connecting people
24/03/2020, 10:57 - / James Ball: Hopefully different in rural Oxfordshire
24/03/2020, 10:58 - Rob;: Sofa delivery cancelled though. Holding out for a mattress at least

24/03/2020, 11:09 - Rob;: Zone 1 office land is definitely deserted
24/03/2020, 11:12 - Paul;: i want to throw in an 812 as well
24/03/2020, 11:13 - Stefan;: There's a big drop off in people commuting for work, but they also cut tube services massively. So the rush hour trains still running are rammed
24/03/2020, 11:18 - / James Ball: Office workers safe. General workers dead

24/03/2020, 11:38 - Damian Rumble: It is markedly less busy out of my window of Cally road today. The occasional jogger or people heading to the coop and reappearing a moment later disappointed
24/03/2020, 11:45 - David;: Um. But Rob sir, the helicopter is not an animal.
24/03/2020, 11:46 - Phill: >An Jet Fighter
24/03/2020, 11:49 - / James Ball: Horses get 4 entries - seems unfair?
24/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: The helicopter is technically a drupe
24/03/2020, 12:48 - Paul;: lol trying to do the court cases online - none of them have a clue how to use computers
24/03/2020, 12:54 - Stefan;: Yeah I'm sitting at home with no hearings to go to, waiting for judges to figure out how to use Skype
24/03/2020, 13:55 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 13:55 - Paul;: day on the nos would be great
24/03/2020, 13:56 - Rob;: Ah yeah

24/03/2020, 14:07 - Rob;: _WoLoveCream_
24/03/2020, 14:18 - Damian Rumble: When is the Wales revamp due for completion? I am wondering whether it would be worthwhile booking that in sooner rather than later. I imagine when quarentine is lifted people are going to go mad for holidays and it's highly like that foreign travel could be extremely limited at that point still.
24/03/2020, 14:38 - Sam;: Taylor Wimpy and TFL have closed construction sites.
24/03/2020, 15:04 - Paul;: india on a 21 day locky
24/03/2020, 15:11 - Phill: Sauce?
24/03/2020, 15:23 - Sam;: Presenter on 5 Live said it.
24/03/2020, 15:32 - Stefan;: Can confirm through reliable sources
24/03/2020, 15:38 - Paul;: can confirm via internet
24/03/2020, 15:47 - Paul;: An earlier one-day curfew, which was seen as a trial, was flouted by many. At 17:00 on Sunday as part of a nationwide lockdown, Mr Modi called on Indians to clap and cheer emergency services from their balconies, but many misunderstood the call, congregating in the streets as they danced and chanted.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs impossible to fathom the cost that India may have to pay if such irresponsible behaviour continues,‚Äù Mr Modi warned. ‚ÄúSocial distancing is the only option to combat corona.‚Äù
24/03/2020, 15:47 - Paul;: lol how did they troll themselves so hard
24/03/2020, 15:58 - Damian Rumble: Lol tbh I'm not entirely sure how India and South East Asia haven't been more badly shafted by this pandemic. Modern, but poorly organised societies with weaker central governments and corruption/general lack of adherence to the rules should be a perfect breading ground for the virus
24/03/2020, 15:58 - Paul;: Yeah is a bit odd
24/03/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: Unless it‚Äôs already deeply infected them and they‚Äôre too late
24/03/2020, 16:13 - David;: Lol that's brilliant.
24/03/2020, 16:14 - / James Ball: Actually severly affected but poor testing, treatment and reporting
24/03/2020, 16:14 - / James Ball: ?
24/03/2020, 16:21 - David;: Japan are dealing very well with this. Considering old population, huge urabn population density
24/03/2020, 16:46 - Phill: Ah. Got to furlough 5 people now.
24/03/2020, 16:47 - Phill: India and Japan both counties with low meat intake.
24/03/2020, 16:55 - David;: Seems like it will just stay like this now? They are only clarifying existing guidance.
24/03/2020, 16:59 - Paul;: Never leave the lockdown
24/03/2020, 17:00 - Damian Rumble: Japan had a pre existing culture of respecting personal space and wearing face masks if you a bit under the weather which I imagined probably helped
24/03/2020, 17:07 - David;: Ah Italy death figures out. 743.
24/03/2020, 17:07 - David;: Oh John
24/03/2020, 17:09 - Paul;: Big John
24/03/2020, 17:14 - David;: Stock market up 9% though
24/03/2020, 17:14 - David;: Biggest daily rise
24/03/2020, 17:14 - / James Ball: Stefan wins
24/03/2020, 17:15 - David;: Yeah Stefan wins the daily sweep
24/03/2020, 17:16 - David;: Your prize: more lockdown.
24/03/2020, 17:16 - David;: We all win the same thing every day
24/03/2020, 17:16 - Paul;: What about the meat raffle?
24/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: That's up to BOJO
24/03/2020, 17:17 - / James Ball: I do have a gammon hock in the fridge though - very meat raffle
24/03/2020, 17:18 - David;: The meat comes from the flesh of the loser?
24/03/2020, 17:18 - David;: So the loser has to donate a leg as flesh for the winner.
24/03/2020, 17:18 - / James Ball: Sam
24/03/2020, 17:19 - / James Ball: Sounding very much like a game of president. need to swap your best organs at the end of the round
24/03/2020, 17:19 - / James Ball: President has a lot of liver, peasant just lots of bowel
24/03/2020, 17:20 - Damian Rumble: Ahh... A cunning strategy
24/03/2020, 17:20 - Stefan;: Sam, I'll take my meat raffle prize now
24/03/2020, 17:21 - Stefan;: Stocks are running low

24/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: Meh grogodoines
24/03/2020, 18:01 - Paul;: USA might let it run and not bother with a locky
24/03/2020, 18:01 - Paul;: Back to normal by Easter
24/03/2020, 18:02 - David;: Who's saying that?
24/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 18:03 - David;: Will be interesting. How fucked that might get
24/03/2020, 18:04 - David;: The imperial model said that mitgation alone without supression would still kill over 1m people in US.
24/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: Trumpy no locky
24/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: The amount of people suing after this in the US
24/03/2020, 18:06 - Damian Rumble: September 2020. The world returns to normal but all travel to the USA is banned due to a hot bed of the virus. I wonder how that will go down for the US economy...
24/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: If he lets it loose
24/03/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: He should do shouldn‚Äôt he though just so we can see what happens
24/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: Forecast of a 24% decline in US GDP for the second quarter
24/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: Quarter of the economy gone.
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Hospital  now completely divided into red and green zones
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Red being covid positive or suspected
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Theyve divided staff into red and green teams, and the two cannot mix
24/03/2020, 18:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Red teams work 14 days in a row with 14 days off afterwards to self isolate...
24/03/2020, 18:23 - / James Ball: What colour are you?
24/03/2020, 18:47 - Damian Rumble: Is that as it stands or under the trump "do nothing and be casually racist about it" plan?
24/03/2020, 18:48 - Damian Rumble: Seems smart... Though surely you are effectively commiting to be half staffed for the foreseeable future...
24/03/2020, 19:04 - David;: Quite dystopian.
24/03/2020, 19:04 - David;: That's as it stands.
24/03/2020, 19:13 - Damian Rumble: Got a source for that?
24/03/2020, 19:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Green
24/03/2020, 19:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, an underclass within an underclass
24/03/2020, 19:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Someone I work with got evicted by their landlady at the weekend because they deemed her too high risk
24/03/2020, 19:20 - David;: Goldman Sachs
24/03/2020, 19:21 - Paul;: You might have heard of them. Little building society
24/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: That's mental
24/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Like actually illegal, there is a ban on evictions.
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Phill: Buffett here
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: I think it was a "soft" eviction
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Rob;: Yeah, I've seen a couple of landlord eviction emails shared online on the same basis
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: The woman went fucking mental and made her wear gloves and masks around the house and spent the whole time crying
24/03/2020, 19:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Told her she had to go, by which point she had already decided she couldn't stay and so didnt fight it
24/03/2020, 19:33 - Phill: Just told 5 people they're furloughed. One girl literally cried for an hour down the phone moaning.
24/03/2020, 19:33 - Phill: Why you moaning? You get a month off on almost full pay!
24/03/2020, 19:35 - Phill: Anyone watching The English Game on Netflix?
24/03/2020, 19:52 - David;: Nah but seen it. Is it a new thing?
24/03/2020, 19:53 - Phill: Yeah some downton style drama centred around the FA cup in the 1870's

>flaky 4G connection
>#myphoneisintheloft
24/03/2020, 19:53 - Rob;: Ah. So there's sort of football to watch is what you're saving?
24/03/2020, 19:54 - David;: Any good?
24/03/2020, 19:54 - Phill: Yeah. An old Etonian currently moaning about player salaries
24/03/2020, 19:55 - David;: Never experienced football withdrawal like this. Usually there is at least a constant drip feed of transfer news
24/03/2020, 20:11 - / James Ball: If it returns behind closed doors, how many injuries will be back by then
24/03/2020, 20:11 - / James Ball: might swing things if key players are back
24/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: One good team will have forgotten how to play and one shit team will suddenly be good
24/03/2020, 21:11 - Phill: Yeah the US is fucked. WHO saying it's going to become new epicentre.
24/03/2020, 21:13 - Rob;: Might actually be something Trump can't spin
24/03/2020, 21:17 - Jack G;: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got the biggest virus, the best virus. More virus than anyone‚Äù
24/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: We beat Italy's death toll bigly
24/03/2020, 21:18 - / James Ball: He doesn't even try and spin though
24/03/2020, 21:18 - / James Ball: he just lies and blames someone else
24/03/2020, 21:23 - / James Ball: "Trump says he wants the country 'opened up and just raring to go by Easter,' "
24/03/2020, 21:23 - / James Ball: Coronavirus done in 19 days according to trump
24/03/2020, 21:23 - Phill: At the same time
24/03/2020, 21:23 - Phill: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52012048
24/03/2020, 21:24 - / James Ball: Wellll.
24/03/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: I feel like a lot of officials in the US are just going to start straight up ignoring him and going past him if they're not already
24/03/2020, 21:31 - / James Ball: "So, I think Easter Sunday, and you'll have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time. And it's just about the timeline that I think is right,"
24/03/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: Time to increase bottle pissing rate and wear Kleenex boxes on my feet
24/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: Contact not extended due to corona. So I will be joining redundancy club in 2 weeks
24/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: Ever-expanding club.

25/03/2020, 08:45 - Paul;: so panic over nothing
25/03/2020, 08:45 - Paul;: the common cold
25/03/2020, 08:51 - / James Ball: I mean, I would say I just seemed to get way worse colds this winter
25/03/2020, 08:52 - Paul;: yes my cold was a lot worse and hadn't had one in 3 years
25/03/2020, 08:52 - / James Ball: slightly different from a regular cold but not awful
25/03/2020, 08:53 - Paul;: yes, felt different but didn't have the symptoms they keep going on about - but they haven't released a spectrum of symptoms from mild to extreme
25/03/2020, 08:53 - Jack G;: Apparently loss of smell and taste are now symptoms
25/03/2020, 08:53 - / James Ball: A friend of mine's wife works in that lab
25/03/2020, 08:54 - / James Ball: ah. just like what happens with a stuffy nose? I definitely had that for a day
25/03/2020, 08:55 - Paul;: it's just a big troll virus
25/03/2020, 08:55 - / James Ball: quite a trolly virus. Occasional death but usually just a cold
25/03/2020, 08:55 - Paul;: with the number of celebrities and politicians who are all testing positive it's safe to assume from a small sample like theirs that it is incredibly widespread
25/03/2020, 08:56 - Paul;: you could make that assumption?
25/03/2020, 08:57 - / James Ball: biased set though. celebrities and politicians more likely to travel and meet a lot of people
25/03/2020, 08:58 - / James Ball: the only thing it doesn't explain is why we're seeing increased deaths no and not before it was already so widespread
25/03/2020, 08:59 - Jack G;: I think there‚Äôs quite a long time between initial contraction and death. A huge laggy virus
25/03/2020, 09:00 - Paul;: that is true
25/03/2020, 09:05 - Phill: You could lose a few thousand deaths if they looked like something normal
25/03/2020, 09:06 - / James Ball: yeah but if we all had it in February then there would be a more even death rate and not such a spike now. even accounting for lack of testing etc
25/03/2020, 09:23 - Paul;: on dial in's with webcam - all these middle aged men who choose to wear superdry
25/03/2020, 09:23 - Paul;: that's an unacceptable pandemic
25/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: Can you link the kind of superdry outfits they are sporting
25/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: Need to visualise the overall look
25/03/2020, 09:34 - Paul;: just the general big logo shite
25/03/2020, 09:34 - Paul;: https://www.google.com/search?q=superdry+tshirt&sxsrf=ALeKk021X2gF1M3xGRCF1LQjyC2anuGqEw:1585128853370&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5v-mRqbXoAhXzThUIHaGyDkMQ_AUoAnoECAwQBA&biw=1280&bih=610
25/03/2020, 09:36 - David;: How has this happened? Who told then it was acceptable?
25/03/2020, 09:37 - Paul;: it's everywhere in the midlands - superdry dads as far as the eye can see
25/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: yeah, it's a big thing. middle class dads wanting to look young
25/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: go buy themselves a nice ¬£80 hoody
25/03/2020, 09:48 - Phill: I just wish Superdry would use more branding and zips on their clothing. I'd probably buy it then.

25/03/2020, 10:12 - / James Ball: time to preserve things in salt? grit the path?
25/03/2020, 10:19 - Phill: Preserve your shit
25/03/2020, 10:19 - Phill: Salt your shit
25/03/2020, 10:20 - Damian Rumble: Remember all the deaths are people with pre existing health conditions succumbing to pneumonia in ill prepared health systems across the world.
25/03/2020, 10:22 - Damian Rumble: Germany has an impressively large amount of capacity in its health system and sees some of the best survival rates of any nation.
25/03/2020, 10:23 - / James Ball: yeah, but if we all got it as early as february, are we really only seeing those early deaths now, 6/7 weeks later?
25/03/2020, 10:28 - David;: Ah. Thoughtful, but it seems she's gone for pure bulk and quantity here.
25/03/2020, 10:28 - / James Ball: did she at least order a case of wine?
25/03/2020, 10:28 - Phill: Got beccas brother on a wine run for us this morning
25/03/2020, 10:29 - David;: Most people would buy a few fancy chocolates and flowers. She's gone for a years supply of basic salt and toilet paper

It's not just Italy. In the week 16-22 March, Madrid's NO2 levels were down 41% compared with 2019, and Lisbon's rates were down 51%.

25/03/2020, 16:57 - David;: Ah good, no migrant workers to pick the harvest this year so mass food shortages possible.
25/03/2020, 16:57 - David;: So all the unemployed can return to the land.
25/03/2020, 16:57 - David;: A peasant lifestyle. Could be alright.

25/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: yeah, I saw rischi rich say that too
25/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: hopefully it's not just a tax cut
25/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: hopefully it's cold hard socialist cash
25/03/2020, 17:10 - Paul;: the ¬£1k
25/03/2020, 17:12 - / James Ball: I presume they will essentially do the same thing they're doing for PAYE but base it off my profit instead
25/03/2020, 17:12 - / James Ball: it's just about the only thing they could do that was fair
25/03/2020, 17:13 - / James Ball: Maybe average profit over the last 3 years or something to stop everyone putting in a really high income on 5th April

25/03/2020, 17:23 - / James Ball: Rob had a trolly 681
25/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: But rob also had no original thought. If I‚Äôd said 670 he‚Äôd have gone 671
25/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: I inspired that (now voided) choice
25/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: It was not within the spirit of the sweepy
25/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: sweepy spirit
25/03/2020, 17:27 - Paul;: 683 was actually the past 5 day average. That‚Äôs how I picked 680

25/03/2020, 17:54 - Phill: Curb your enthusiasm ?
25/03/2020, 17:55 - Phill: You dwelling under a rock?
25/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: Oh I thought you meant she was watching a series called curb that you hadn‚Äôt heard of

25/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: It does make things a lot more peaceful. Fan of the locky
25/03/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: Just another 2 and a bit weeks left of the locky
25/03/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: Should surprise us with lockdowns more often
25/03/2020, 18:08 - Jack G;: Will surely be extended at least a further 2 weeks?
25/03/2020, 18:09 - Paul;: Have you got enough bog roll to get through that?
25/03/2020, 18:11 - David;: Never heard of Curb. So shes got the entire 15 series or whatever to revisit now?
25/03/2020, 18:11 - David;: Is she aware the early ones are much better as well
25/03/2020, 18:17 - Sam;: She‚Äôs completely unaware.

25/03/2020, 20:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Pretty sure Korea did something like this
25/03/2020, 20:11 - David;: Yeah they were
25/03/2020, 20:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Perhaps people cancelled their own phones
25/03/2020, 20:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah the article actually says that's impossible
25/03/2020, 20:13 - David;: this is suggesting that it is a requirement to have a phone so can't purely be people cancelling to save money. It could be a lot of people cancelling work phones because not going in, but that would be unlikely to explain it all. Hence they are inferring they could be under-reporting the overall mortality rate
25/03/2020, 20:13 - David;: But could be bollocks
25/03/2020, 20:35 - Sam;: This message was deleted

25/03/2020, 20:54 - David;: Yeah wouldn't have noticed. Could have got away with that.
25/03/2020, 20:54 - Rob;: I'm assuming it wasn't a dick pick, otherwise who are you sending a dick pick when you're quarantined with your girlfriend?
25/03/2020, 20:57 - Sam;: Her. We‚Äôre in different rooms.
25/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: Lol, too lazy to walk to the next room with your dick out
25/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: Or is it the element of surprise?

26/03/2020, 13:38 - David;: You have to eat toilet paper and wipe your arse with dried pasta
26/03/2020, 13:38 - David;: An ironic punishment for the panic buyers
26/03/2020, 13:47 - Paul;: lol, i assume we'll never get our boom times - being fucked from all sides. 2008 crash and now virus depression - our parents lucked out massively
26/03/2020, 13:47 - Paul;: no one young really had any savings either before this
26/03/2020, 13:49 - David;: Plus climate change and decarbonisation. Don't forget that nice looming disaster.
26/03/2020, 13:49 - David;: and we just threw a self-inflicted Brexit in the mix to troll ourselves harder.
26/03/2020, 13:50 - Paul;: can't believe a little virus has fucked us over so hard
26/03/2020, 13:51 - Paul;: symptoms - a cough and some shitty pants and we have to close down the country
26/03/2020, 13:52 - David;: I sense next couple of weeks the consensus will be severely tested. There may be a backlash.
26/03/2020, 14:03 - Phill: Economy held together with pritt stick and masking tape.
26/03/2020, 14:20 - Damian Rumble: I thought that was me?
26/03/2020, 14:24 - Damian Rumble: Unemployment looks horrific but it's not like the 1930s. The moment the virus has receeded in the summer all the music and sports industry all those jobs will return and James Ball will have work again (providing he hasn't starved to death or succumbed to some shitty arse based disease by then)
26/03/2020, 14:29 - Paul;: lol a shitty arse based disease
26/03/2020, 14:29 - Paul;: the lingering impact of covid
26/03/2020, 14:41 - David;: Partially true but it's the hysterisis - companies that go bust completely, unemployed not all taken back on, then become gradually less employable, loss of demand from people having been furloughed/on unpaid leave etc. Going to have longer-term effects.
26/03/2020, 14:42 - David;: Basically you can't just mothball an economy and start it up again instantly
26/03/2020, 14:44 - Rob;: But we all still get our grand, right?
26/03/2020, 14:44 - Rob;: The grand will save us
26/03/2020, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: You can buy literally anything with a grand
26/03/2020, 15:54 - David;: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-news-live-coronavirus-update-today-cases-press-conference-white-house-a9426771.html
26/03/2020, 15:54 - David;: Words are irrelevant
26/03/2020, 16:07 - Paul;: Lol chalk that one off
26/03/2020, 17:17 - Jack G;: 662 for Italy, Paul wins
26/03/2020, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: Again!
26/03/2020, 17:23 - David;: You win another day of lockdown
26/03/2020, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: Paul the octopus
26/03/2020, 17:24 - / James Ball: paul is racking up the days of lockdown
26/03/2020, 17:25 - Hamish Sinclair: We will need to get a trophy for this
26/03/2020, 17:25 - Jack G;: He should be so locky. Locky, locky, locky
26/03/2020, 17:26 - David;: üëè
26/03/2020, 17:26 - Damian Rumble: 80% of profits for James...  But not until June. Not especially helpful
26/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: yeah, better than nothing
26/03/2020, 17:27 - Jack G;: Will it get back dated at least?
26/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: can presumably be back dated
26/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: i think the june date is implied that it will take ages to set up
26/03/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: I was hoping it would be averaged over the past couple of ta
26/03/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: x returns
26/03/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: annoyingly my 2019 return was much lower than my 2018 return
26/03/2020, 18:13 - / James Ball: ah. average of the past 36 months. grants are still taxable
26/03/2020, 18:17 - Jack G;: Phil wins UK sleepy
26/03/2020, 18:17 - Jack G;: Sweepy*
26/03/2020, 18:18 - Damian Rumble: 101
26/03/2020, 18:18 - Damian Rumble: Big
26/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: Ah so it‚Äôs getting worse
26/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: But the locky

26/03/2020, 18:34 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
26/03/2020, 18:35 - Damian Rumble: Ah...The actual italy value is 712
26/03/2020, 18:35 - Damian Rumble: @447752458076 winner winner chicken dinner
26/03/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: Ah

26/03/2020, 18:36 - Phill: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 18:46 - Stefan;: Excellent. Death is my victory.
26/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Bit of a tight chest
26/03/2020, 18:49 - / James Ball: ah. death imminent
26/03/2020, 18:49 - / James Ball: are you sure it's not just breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Paul;: This is a classic case of breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Paul;: Don‚Äôt trick yourself
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Phill: He's breathing out. Next.
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Paul;: Proven time and time again to be a case of breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:51 - Phill: On the tombstone:

"He's breathing out"
26/03/2020, 18:52 - / James Ball: Both Rob and I have suffered from a bit of breathing out so far. nothing to worry about
26/03/2020, 18:54 - Rob;: Yeah, it got very noticeable for an evening, but I can put that entirely down to anxiety about house move (had a choice between a week of homelessness or lose a lot of money at one point) multiplied by corona
26/03/2020, 18:54 - Rob;: It's just breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:55 - Phill: I had a good 2 months last year where I couldn't not think about my breathing. Constantly out of breath.
26/03/2020, 18:55 - Phill: Triggered during a weed smoking night.
26/03/2020, 18:56 - Paul;: More or less intense than the PODSU event?
26/03/2020, 18:56 - Phill: Less intense but more annoying and debilitating
26/03/2020, 18:58 - Phill: The only thing that fixed the CO2 balance in my blood thus restoring comfortable breathing was going on a lung shattering run
26/03/2020, 19:00 - David;: The what?
26/03/2020, 19:01 - Phill: Where I had a mental glitch in a meeting and my brain just went onto a loop repeating PODSU PODSU PODSU PODSU from Laputa
26/03/2020, 19:01 - David;: Lol
26/03/2020, 19:01 - David;: Quite a predicament
26/03/2020, 19:02 - David;: I usually don't have a problem remembering to breathe out
26/03/2020, 19:02 - Paul;: Which thing in laputa is it that goes PODSU?
26/03/2020, 19:04 - Phill: When she wakes up in his lighthouse first day and he's showing her that her neck piece is magic and he jumps off a ledge and gets rekt in the brick and she goes "PODSU!! Are you alright?"
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Would this have been noticable to anyone else in the room?
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Paul;: Ah he‚Äôs called PAZU
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Paul;: PAZU PAZU PAZU
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Phill: No
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Phill: Podsu
26/03/2020, 19:05 - / James Ball: >japan
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Paul;: Lol
26/03/2020, 19:06 - Paul;: PODSU
26/03/2020, 19:06 - Phill: No it was a mental loop. Outwardly I was forecasting quarterly cash flow
26/03/2020, 19:06 - / James Ball: inwardly japan
26/03/2020, 19:07 - Phill: Correct.
26/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: Lol. Still managing to do that while internally there was nothing left but PODSU
26/03/2020, 19:10 - David;: I was reading people with clinical anxiety are feeling better. Because usually they are worried the worst might happen and everyone is carrying on as normal. But now the worst has happened and everyone else agrees with them
26/03/2020, 19:11 - David;: So their thought patterns are no longer pathological but rational and socially sanctioned
26/03/2020, 19:12 - Phill: Agree with this. Just got adrenal fatigue.
26/03/2020, 19:12 - / James Ball: yeah, I'm actually feeling pretty good now about locky. Just bored
26/03/2020, 19:13 - Phill: Also more empathy about now. Give more of a shit about people on benefits etc. NHS. Hopefully instigates a long term social shift towards a more inclusive society... ....but probably not.
26/03/2020, 19:14 - Paul;: As long as there‚Äôs a continued backlash against celebrities that would be worth it
26/03/2020, 19:18 - Phill: Tfw buying all my food from online french supermarkets now.
26/03/2020, 19:18 - Phill: https://www.frenchclick.co.uk/
26/03/2020, 19:18 - / James Ball: fewer gwyneth paltrows would be worth it
26/03/2020, 19:18 - / James Ball: what buy?
26/03/2020, 19:19 - Phill: Merguez. Frites. Fromage.
26/03/2020, 19:19 - Phill: Poullet de Bresse
26/03/2020, 19:19 - Phill: If this weather holds up I'll be having barbecued french sausage and vin by the gallon
26/03/2020, 19:20 - David;: Hard not to drink every night
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: Yes.
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: Very.
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Would love to know the average weight gain per person
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: I'm losing weight.
26/03/2020, 19:21 - / James Ball: I'm on a diet anyway, losing weight all the time
26/03/2020, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: ?
26/03/2020, 19:21 - / James Ball: no mid week drinking also in place
26/03/2020, 19:21 - David;: Yeah. You should move into which every branch of medicine deals with obesity and booze problems. Cardiovascular stuff? Big growth area after this
26/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Had all of this going in January. Seems a long time ago.
26/03/2020, 19:22 - Phill: Not eating snacks at work. 3 normal meals a day. Finish work bang on 5 so getting a run in. Lunches and breakfast is healthy and not pastry/sausage roll/crisp based
26/03/2020, 19:23 - David;: Yeah we're having good meals in the day. It's just at night a strong tendency to booze.
26/03/2020, 19:24 - David;: Fay's hitting the bourbon old fashioneds
26/03/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: good to get a cocktail in
26/03/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: we've got a lot of spirits
26/03/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: might do a whiskey weekend
26/03/2020, 19:47 - Damian Rumble: I find sitting at home all day extremely lethargic. Sloth breeds sloth
26/03/2020, 19:56 - / James Ball: ISS flying over southern UK tonight
26/03/2020, 19:56 - / James Ball: easy to spot with the clear skies
26/03/2020, 19:57 - / James Ball: 20:29
26/03/2020, 20:01 - David;: This clapping for carers thing
26/03/2020, 20:01 - David;: Very Soviet
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Rob;: Yeah, very odd
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Rob;: No carers actually there to see as far as I know
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: All gather to cheer in the street like the Indians
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: Spread the virus further
26/03/2020, 20:03 - David;: People going mad for it here
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Jack G;: One of my neighbours has just let off some fireworks
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Damian Rumble: People in the block opposite us have got David Bowie heroes playing out across the street at full volume
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Stefan;: Yeah wild for it here, fireworks everywhere
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Damian Rumble: Stefan I can see you house from where I am standing

26/03/2020, 20:05 - Rob;: Blitz spirit
26/03/2020, 20:05 - / James Ball: fireworks here recently too
26/03/2020, 20:05 - Rob;: This is why we Brexited
26/03/2020, 20:06 - / James Ball: have our own virus our way
26/03/2020, 20:06 - David;: Brexiteers believed in privatising healthcare before this I believe?
26/03/2020, 20:07 - David;: Don't see them mentioning that so much
26/03/2020, 20:07 - Jack G;: Nah they all thought we‚Äôd be getting 350 million a week more for nhs
26/03/2020, 20:08 - David;: Your hannans etc. are big on privatising healthcare
26/03/2020, 20:09 - Stefan;: Where are you?
26/03/2020, 20:10 - / James Ball: london?
26/03/2020, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: Atkins square
26/03/2020, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 20:13 - / James Ball: is that where you live or have you illegally broken locky laws Damo?
26/03/2020, 20:14 - Paul;: Of course he‚Äôs broken regulations
26/03/2020, 20:17 - Phill: The autism. The complete lack of respect for the NHS. The liberal Tory. The cunt.
26/03/2020, 20:17 - Rob;: He does look like he's buying himself food...
26/03/2020, 20:18 - / James Ball: photo looks like it's from height though
26/03/2020, 20:18 - Phill: Also he's looking at Stefan's house and taking screenshots.
26/03/2020, 20:22 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 20:22 - Stefan;: Oh yeah that's your girlfriend's place near me
26/03/2020, 20:28 - Damian Rumble: Do you fancy popping out for a chuck about in our state sponsored exercise session at some point?
26/03/2020, 20:35 - / James Ball: illegally breaking quarantine to see your girlfriend
26/03/2020, 20:35 - / James Ball: exactly the thing trying to be stopped
26/03/2020, 20:36 - Phill: Flagrant
26/03/2020, 20:37 - Stefan;: I'll meet you in a park but I'm not touching a frisbee that someone else has handled
26/03/2020, 20:38 - Paul;: Damo you are patient zero. Not caring for the rules
26/03/2020, 20:38 - Paul;: We should lock you up
26/03/2020, 20:39 - David;: He is the pangolin
26/03/2020, 20:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah pretty sure you're supposed to either move in or break up?
26/03/2020, 20:53 - Phill: This is true. My sister has moved in with her boyfriend because she was moving back and forth.
26/03/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: The rules don‚Äôt apply to Damian remember
26/03/2020, 20:54 - Phill: You mean liberal elite in general.
26/03/2020, 20:56 - Damian Rumble: I actually forgot to bring mine. You bring the plastic and I'll bring the sanitiser?
26/03/2020, 21:59 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 22:00 - Paul;: Dat herd tho
26/03/2020, 22:01 - / James Ball: a herd of dead cattle

26/03/2020, 22:10 - / James Ball: italy still worse by most metrics
26/03/2020, 22:10 - David;: More deaths than first day of the Somme now
26/03/2020, 22:12 - / James Ball: san marino very johnned if you sort by deaths/pop - 619/million
26/03/2020, 22:12 - / James Ball: only actually 21 deaths
26/03/2020, 22:27 - Damian Rumble: All blown over by Easter...
26/03/2020, 22:28 - / James Ball: yeah, next weekend it will be fine
26/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: This is going to get so much worse.
26/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: 1bn cases and 80million deaths I reckon is my sweepy.
26/03/2020, 22:32 - / James Ball: but Phil, Trump says it will be fine next weekend
26/03/2020, 22:33 - Phill: Thousands is pussy talk. This is just ramping up. A blind summit.
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: just worked out what my socialist free cheque from government will be
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: ¬£951.82 per month
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: less than minimum wage
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: üëå
26/03/2020, 22:56 - Paul;: It‚Äôs like labour government simulator
26/03/2020, 22:56 - / James Ball: would be quite a surprise if BOJO wins the labour leadership election too

27/03/2020, 07:15 - Hamish Sinclair: This project is being run out of KCL and guys where I used to work. Think they are trying to gather data on how virus is spreading in the absence on community wide testing

27/03/2020, 09:17 - Damian Rumble: Trying to claim that his hard left wing agenda has been proved right by the Coronavirus
27/03/2020, 09:18 - Damian Rumble: Forsure spending more money on the NHS would have helped, but I am not sure that Coronavirus has justified nationalising rail, water, broadband, energy, post and education
27/03/2020, 09:24 - Jack G;: I think he was trying to make the point (granted quite poorly) that it proves the money has always been there and the last 5 years of austerity was an ideological choice
27/03/2020, 09:50 - / James Ball: Yeah I think the point was more in the interest of showing that the Torys are pricks more than anything
27/03/2020, 09:56 - Rob;: But he has managed to frame it from a personal vindication angle, rather than the more appropriate 'the government could and should have chosen to make your lives better'
27/03/2020, 09:56 - Rob;: Gone quite Kevin Keegan 'I'd love it if we beat them'
27/03/2020, 09:59 - / James Ball: Yes, it does have a rather outgoing manager vibe to it

27/03/2020, 14:33 - Jack G;: Will keep rising this quickly for another 10 days I reckon. Only at the start of the locky so won‚Äôt see benefits for a while
27/03/2020, 14:34 - Rob;: Yeah I was looking at other country's curves and when they locked down, seems to take 10-15 days to slow noticeably
27/03/2020, 14:35 - Rob;: More of a case of but how much worse would be it have been without lockdown, rather than expecting lockdown to solve things on its own
27/03/2020, 14:37 - Paul;: so should we expect to rise up towards 600/700 per day?
27/03/2020, 14:38 - Jack G;: Hopefully slightly lower, maybe in 500 range? I can‚Äôt see much we‚Äôve done differently from the other countries that got to those numbers

27/03/2020, 14:45 - Jack G;: Our curve seems to be coming back down after a terrible start
27/03/2020, 14:46 - Phill: So mortality rate appears to be 5%. But this is 5% of serious, tested, cases of which the estimate is 20% of cases. So if we multiply 14,000 by 5 to give estimate of cases we get 759 deaths from 70000 cases. 1% mortality.
27/03/2020, 14:46 - Jack G;: Also depends a huge amount on age and underlying conditions

27/03/2020, 15:22 - Paul;: Virtual Grand National to 'cheer up the nation'
Don't throw away that Grand National sweepstake kit... because a virtual race will be held in place of one of the UK's biggest sporting occasions.

The National, held at Aintree and first run in 1839, was cancelled earlier this month because of the coronavirus outbreak.

In its place, 40 of the runners will take part in the virtual version, which uses CGI technology and special algorithms.

It will be broadcast by ITV at 17:00 BST on Saturday 4 April - the day the National was planned to run.

The special broadcast will also pit Aintree legends Red Rum and Tiger Roll - who this year was bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive win in the famous steeplechase - against each other in a 40-horse Race of Champions.

27/03/2020, 15:53 - Rob;: Full of dairy either way

27/03/2020, 17:05 - Rob;: But not necessarily for just the stupid individuals
27/03/2020, 17:05 - David;: Yeah that's the issue
27/03/2020, 17:05 - David;: Caused by their idiocy but consequences felt equally
27/03/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: Like undeveloped nations and climate change
27/03/2020, 17:06 - Stefan;: The consequences will definitely be felt harder in aggregate by his voting base in the US (old people)

27/03/2020, 17:07 - Stefan;: It's going to get really bad there, the US so poorly equipped to deal with it
