914,21/04/2018, 20:44 , that's encouraging,DamianR

1367,30/04/2018, 21:33 , it's existing customers who don't threaten to leave who get shafted,RobG
1368,30/04/2018, 21:34 , so right now they are buttering up simon in his new house with the best deals you can imagine?,DaveY
1369,30/04/2018, 21:34 , they're actually paying him to use the internet,DaveY

1375,30/04/2018, 21:35 , it it hadn't happened by accident while i was sitting next to him i'd say he did it on purpose,RobG
1376,30/04/2018, 21:36 , you should just clain that loyalty bonus as a public good given you all paid in equally. demand he reimburse you the difference on an ongoing basis,DaveY
1377,30/04/2018, 21:36 , lol,RobG
1378,30/04/2018, 21:36 , punishment,RobG

1381,30/04/2018, 21:38 , lol - how can they arbitrarily charge you £50? was that a termination fee in the contract?,DaveY
1382,30/04/2018, 21:38 , yeah early termination fee,PhilH
1383,30/04/2018, 21:38 , yeah exactly - that's the only fair solution. so will his chikdren and his childrens children,DaveY

1385,30/04/2018, 21:40 , what about the delay,PaulD
1386,30/04/2018, 21:41 , yeah rob think about it this way. you'll now be free of sky's 10 second delay,PhilH
1387,30/04/2018, 21:41 , so you can actually watch sport live now,PhilH
1388,30/04/2018, 21:41 , yes i think minutes,PaulD
1389,30/04/2018, 21:41 , maybe as much as 10,PaulD
1390,30/04/2018, 21:43 , MediaShared,PhilH
1391,30/04/2018, 21:44 , ```delay is real```,RobG
1392,30/04/2018, 21:49 , do you ❤ delay?,PaulD
1393,30/04/2018, 21:51 , latency is the word you're searching for,JamesB
1394,30/04/2018, 21:51 , don't forget about jitter,JamesB
1395,30/04/2018, 21:52 , wouldnt latency be unintentional lag?,DaveY
1396,30/04/2018, 21:53 , >theory,PaulD
1397,30/04/2018, 21:53 , >did,DaveY
1398,30/04/2018, 21:54 , so he has abandoned this theory or does he stand by it?,DaveY
1399,30/04/2018, 21:54 , can't remember why he thought it,RobG
1400,30/04/2018, 21:54 , offered this 'i guess there might be a slight delay so they can bleep swearing or cut the feed if some shit goes down lol',RobG
1401,30/04/2018, 21:54 , there's usually some delay in the satellite feed,RobG
1402,30/04/2018, 21:54 , has to be sent to space and back and processed,RobG
1403,30/04/2018, 21:54 , but that might only be few hundred milliseconds or seconds,RobG
1404,30/04/2018, 21:55 , watching sport over here it goes life>tv>app>radio,PaulD
1405,30/04/2018, 21:55 , so basically he 10 years later no longer believes there is significant delay,RobG
1406,30/04/2018, 21:55 , in terms of delay time,PaulD
1407,30/04/2018, 21:55 , hmm nah radio before app surely?,DaveY
1408,30/04/2018, 21:56 , crucially speed of light>internet bandwidth,DaveY
1409,30/04/2018, 21:56 , nah my app always ruins it with an alert before i hear it on the radio,PaulD
1410,30/04/2018, 21:57 , socred by nikolas bendtner no less,RobG
1411,30/04/2018, 21:57 , yeah clearly life is before any representation of it.,DaveY
1412,30/04/2018, 21:58 , but we're talking seconds,DaveY
1413,30/04/2018, 21:58 , but my radio is internet radio,PaulD
1414,30/04/2018, 21:58 , actually,PaulD
1415,30/04/2018, 21:58 , ah. vital,DaveY
1416,30/04/2018, 21:58 , critical,PaulD
1417,30/04/2018, 21:58 , big delay there,DaveY
1418,30/04/2018, 21:58 , yeah that makes sense,PaulD
1419,30/04/2018, 21:59 , only place i can follow 4th division baseball,PaulD
1420,30/04/2018, 21:59 , apart from the app alert,PaulD
1421,30/04/2018, 21:59 , is that where the real action is?,DaveY
1422,30/04/2018, 22:00 , what team do you follow?,DaveY
1423,30/04/2018, 22:00 , yeah i follow a range of minor league teams who are feeder teams to the chicago white sox major league team,PaulD
1424,30/04/2018, 22:00 , why?,PhilH
1425,30/04/2018, 22:00 , lol,DaveY
1426,30/04/2018, 22:00 , why no just bandwagon the white sox?,PhilH
1427,30/04/2018, 22:01 , is that where you see the emerging players?,DaveY
1428,30/04/2018, 22:02 , no bandwagon on the white sox. they’re raw shit and rebuilding so figured i’d follow a team and learn the upcoming players as well,PaulD
1429,30/04/2018, 22:02 , winston-salem dash are where the action is. the double a affiliate,PaulD
1430,30/04/2018, 22:02 , so you're basically doing an independent scouting programme,PhilH
1431,30/04/2018, 22:02 , yeah yeah yeah,PaulD
1432,30/04/2018, 22:02 , 👍🏾,PhilH
1433,30/04/2018, 22:03 , is this quite niche. what sort of crowds will the dash be pulling in?,DaveY
1434,30/04/2018, 22:03 , MediaShared,PaulD
1435,30/04/2018, 22:04 , around 4000 on a weekend,PaulD
1436,30/04/2018, 22:06 , it’s always good to have a bit of baseball on,PaulD
1437,30/04/2018, 22:07 , what's your favourite base?,PhilH
1438,30/04/2018, 22:08 , based base,DaveY
1439,30/04/2018, 22:08 , all the bases,PaulD
1440,30/04/2018, 22:08 , all your base are belong to us,PaulD
1441,30/04/2018, 22:09 , but one base has to be the most based,PhilH
1442,30/04/2018, 22:09 , how many balls get bowled per 1 actual hit?,DaveY
1443,30/04/2018, 22:09 , got to be 1st base on second strike,PhilH
1444,30/04/2018, 22:10 , >bowled,PaulD
1445,30/04/2018, 22:11 , if you get 4 balls it’s a walk and if you get 3 strikes you’re out,PaulD
1446,30/04/2018, 22:11 , but you can have foul balls in play that don’t count towards that,PaulD
1447,30/04/2018, 22:11 , so could be infinite,PaulD
1448,30/04/2018, 22:11 , the answer david is infinity,PaulD
1449,30/04/2018, 22:12 , what's the home run to serve ratio?,PhilH

1515,30/04/2018, 22:48 , yes i'm on it,DamianR
1516,30/04/2018, 22:49 , anyway... it doesn't make sense to imagine the universe expanding into anything because such an interpretation is limited to just 3 dimensions.... as humans are... where as in reality the universe is not.,DamianR
1517,30/04/2018, 22:50 , ergo we can never fully comprehend how the universe expands,DamianR

1524,30/04/2018, 22:52 , also this is the point at which astrophysics starts to sound a lot like religious mysticism,StefanL

1539,30/04/2018, 23:01 , .... well in short the standard model of particle physics is a bit shit. it really sucks at explaining gravity. it was suggested that rather matter existing as particles it existed as strings. thus allowing for a higher number of dimensions... through which gravity carrying particles or gravitons would weaken as it passed from source to observer. a by product of this allowed for multiverses.,DamianR
1540,30/04/2018, 23:01 , though you should probably take that description with a pinch of salt,DamianR
1541,30/04/2018, 23:03 , so basically someone thought up multiverses by accident,StefanL
1542,30/04/2018, 23:03 , just stumbled on it when they weren't looking,StefanL
1543,30/04/2018, 23:04 , doesn't explain why another universe can't exist,PhilH
1544,30/04/2018, 23:07 , i believe we're just inside a huge alien's marble as evidenced in video footage seen at the end of men in black 1,RobG
1545,30/04/2018, 23:09 , so you like sciences which examine trivial questions and provide self-evident answers?,DaveY
1546,30/04/2018, 23:10 , 'biology'. 'let's count the trees' 'god probably didn't make us' 'chimps are people too',DaveY
1547,30/04/2018, 23:11 , never did anything for anyone,RobG
1548,30/04/2018, 23:12 , i do like the golgi apparatus though. and the bowmans capsule,DaveY
1549,30/04/2018, 23:12 , and ganglions. weird shit like that,DaveY
1550,30/04/2018, 23:14 , isnt that just all solved with the deep sea vaults etc.,DaveY
1551,30/04/2018, 23:14 , not really,RobG
1552,30/04/2018, 23:14 , they just seem a plausible place,RobG
1553,30/04/2018, 23:15 , physics is over. i’m calling it. it’s old news and bullshit,PaulD
1554,30/04/2018, 23:15 , that's you told damo,StefanL
1555,30/04/2018, 23:16 , leave the thread for 40mins to drive home and i have to put an end to physics,PaulD
1556,30/04/2018, 23:26 , what i dont get about aliens is,DaveY
1557,30/04/2018, 23:27 , everyone is always saying 'yeah there's shit loads of aliens everywhere because theres loads of planets',DaveY
1558,30/04/2018, 23:28 , but we dont understamd how life developed on earth properly yet so it could have just been a massive freak. just because you have a planet that is superficially quite ike earth doesnt guarantee jodie marie brain will pop up in a few billion years,DaveY
1559,30/04/2018, 23:29 , yeah i agree,RobG
1560,30/04/2018, 23:29 , and it took quite a long time even for microbial life to develop here,RobG
1561,30/04/2018, 23:31 , the cambrian explosion etc. - so most planets are probably just rotting away with a few shitty prokaryotes,DaveY
1562,30/04/2018, 23:31 , i suppose scientists are looking for microorganisms. it's doctor who that's propagating the fucking loads of comolex life thing,RobG
1563,30/04/2018, 23:33 , and they all seem to have heads and have the same basic body structure as us. convienient,DaveY
1564,30/04/2018, 23:33 , the cambrian explosion is rather over quoted. it's just a diary good first bit of evidence for lots of new body shapes that were quite probably bin exhistance hundred of millions of years before but have just happen to have been preserved in one area.,RobG
1565,30/04/2018, 23:34 , alien life could be completely mental,RobG
1566,30/04/2018, 23:36 , we won't be able to get close to it,DaveY
1567,30/04/2018, 23:36 , different conditions might make for a different replicating moleculenjsntead of dna or rna. maybe just proteins and replicating and function molecules. or maybe just nucleic acid based rather than using proteins to perform functions.,RobG
1568,30/04/2018, 23:37 , maybe none of those molecules are stable in the conditions and alien life uses moelcules that can't exist on earth,RobG
1569,30/04/2018, 23:37 , is protein all it's cracked up to be?,DaveY
1570,30/04/2018, 23:37 , it's pretty good,RobG
1571,30/04/2018, 23:37 , hmmm,DaveY
1572,30/04/2018, 23:37 , even a squiggle of barely protein can fuck you up,RobG
1573,30/04/2018, 23:38 , a fucking prion,DaveY
1574,30/04/2018, 23:38 , proteins pretty much do everything,RobG
1575,30/04/2018, 23:38 , i've never read a book by a protein.,DaveY
1576,30/04/2018, 23:39 , you couldn't read or write a book without them,RobG
1577,30/04/2018, 23:40 , i just think if the proteins haven't paid into the system they shouldn't be using our services,DaveY
1578,30/04/2018, 23:41 , a lot of proteins actually work in the nhs as drugs,RobG
1579,30/04/2018, 23:42 , oh so they're drugs as well? all they bring is trouble.,DaveY

2171,13/05/2018, 17:17 , i was thinking the other day how much they have us over a barrell. like if they decided to introduce a 20 pound fee next year i would pretty much have to pay it.,DaveY
2172,13/05/2018, 17:18 , we'll have to do a proper wembley style trophy presentation. you walking up the barn steps shaking everyone's hand to collect it to the sound of three lions,RobG

2188,13/05/2018, 17:39 , if he got booked from the bench or something and it stops him being subbed for fabianski it will cost me 7 points,RobG
2189,13/05/2018, 17:43 , yeah i don't know if that will count as playing or he would still be subbed. my guess is he will still be subbed and it would only count if someone was bench boosting etc.,DaveY
2190,13/05/2018, 17:45 , just checked and he did actually get booked from the bench,RobG
2191,13/05/2018, 17:45 , how has he done that? as a goalkeeper on the bench,DaveY
2192,13/05/2018, 17:47 , for celebrating their late winner apparently,RobG

2321,15/05/2018, 15:27 , it's basically just nostalgia using an analogue dial now really though. not that surprising people can't easily use a system there's increasingly less need to use,RobG
2322,15/05/2018, 15:29 , i don't know how to physical set type but i'm getting along fine with word processing software,RobG

2330,15/05/2018, 15:39 , but there's no particular benefit to using digital vs analogue clocks. whereas huge benefits to  word processors vs typesetting,DaveY
2331,15/05/2018, 15:40 , there's the benefit that one is more accurate and easier to use,RobG

2337,15/05/2018, 15:43 , 'easier to look at' - again the outcome of a situated interaction between subject and object rather than inhering in observed object,DaveY
2338,15/05/2018, 15:45 , i would say it's inherent. to telly he time in analogue clocks you have to look a three hands and the numeber they are closest too then convert that into a number and an am/pm,RobG
2339,15/05/2018, 15:45 , digital clocks you just read the time,RobG
2340,15/05/2018, 15:46 , but the clock. the humble clock,PaulD
2341,15/05/2018, 15:46 , in analogue clocks you also 'just read the time'. there is nothing fundamentally easier about decoding numerical vs non-numeric signs,DaveY
2342,15/05/2018, 15:48 , it feels harder to you/us because we are more used to reading digital clocks now,DaveY
2343,15/05/2018, 15:49 , nah,RobG

3522,15/06/2018, 01:28 , try betfair exchange. even better odds typically,PaulD
3523,15/06/2018, 01:44 , 66/1 on betfair too. but my betfair account seems fucked. not accepting my card. what site were you on hamish?,DaveY

3533,15/06/2018, 12:10 , radio fishin',RobG
3534,15/06/2018, 14:06 , new rule for football. balls not out until it touches the ground,PaulD
3535,15/06/2018, 14:06 , you could have some incredible plays in the stands,PaulD
3536,15/06/2018, 14:07 , that's the rule in rugby. it works  very well.,DamianR
3537,15/06/2018, 14:07 , you gimp m8? one of the players pubes can be in touch and the ball is dead,PhilH
3538,15/06/2018, 14:09 , as long as the player was in play before they played the ball then it's good.,DamianR
3539,15/06/2018, 14:10 , not the same as the ball not touching the ground,PhilH
3540,15/06/2018, 14:15 , headers and volleys from the back of the stands just to set up a good cross,PaulD
3541,15/06/2018, 14:15 , best players are those who can nimbly acrobat across searing,PaulD
3542,15/06/2018, 14:15 , *seating,PaulD
3543,15/06/2018, 14:17 , so could do keeoy ups around the back of the goal to the other side?,DaveY
3544,15/06/2018, 14:17 , if you get fouled behind the goal is it a penno?,DaveY
3545,15/06/2018, 14:21 , would go for a corner,PaulD
3546,15/06/2018, 14:22 , could team member actually stay outside the stadoum and recieve a very long ball over the stands and would have to control it without it dropping and then return with abother huge punt,DaveY
3547,15/06/2018, 14:23 , yeah that would be one of the new tactics,PaulD
3548,15/06/2018, 14:25 , would like to also see a workd class professional game played on an infinitely wide field with no throw ins. see what tactics develop and how they deal with it,DaveY
3549,15/06/2018, 14:25 , like at school,DaveY
3550,15/06/2018, 14:25 , infinitely wide,PaulD
3551,15/06/2018, 14:26 , he’s ran to southampton,PaulD
3552,15/06/2018, 14:27 , yeah fine - as long as it didnt go behind the goal lines. they stretch out to infinity as well,DaveY
3553,15/06/2018, 14:29 , or if you go beyond the goal line an explosive collar goes off every player is forced to wear. makes it tense. don’t stray too far out of sight of where you know the goal line is,PaulD
3554,15/06/2018, 14:30 , yeah yeah. generally more explosive collars would improve things,DaveY
3555,15/06/2018, 14:31 , stops it just descending into a farce if anything,PaulD
3556,15/06/2018, 14:32 , or playing on past 90 minutes if you are behind is allowed but every minute that passes generates a higher likelyhood all the teams collars will be triggered,DaveY
3557,15/06/2018, 14:32 , so a steadily increasing but random chance and you have to balance that against how much you want the result,DaveY

3582,15/06/2018, 17:21 , an a&e nurse friend told me she hates ramadan because she has to send away loads of people who've just tried to eat thhe three meals they've missed really quickly and feel really sick,RobG
3583,15/06/2018, 17:21 , not their dirt ramadan either but still fucking it up,RobG

4089,21/06/2018, 10:56 , i do hope bassoon is on that list,RobG
4090,21/06/2018, 10:56 , corners?,RobG
4091,21/06/2018, 10:57 , could it be the case that 2 teams were playing only to get each other booked?,DaveY
4092,21/06/2018, 10:57 , actually no because the head to head would always be at stake.,DaveY
4093,21/06/2018, 10:58 , would be good though.,DaveY
4094,21/06/2018, 10:58 , cards become goals,DaveY
4095,21/06/2018, 10:58 , celebrated wildly,DaveY
4096,21/06/2018, 11:40 , bernd leno is a big signing in my grotty little book,SamT
4097,21/06/2018, 11:48 , looks decent,DaveY
4098,21/06/2018, 11:49 , lucas torreira next apparently,DaveY
4099,21/06/2018, 11:49 , yes i like the look of him too,RobG
4100,21/06/2018, 11:51 , MediaShared,DaveY
4101,21/06/2018, 11:52 , rubbing your nose it.,SamT
4102,21/06/2018, 11:53 , he’s been more than replaced though with fabo and keito,SamT
4103,21/06/2018, 11:53 , with oxo,DaveY
4104,21/06/2018, 11:53 , milno,DaveY
4105,21/06/2018, 11:53 , robust,SamT
4106,21/06/2018, 11:54 , i think lallana might be broken though,DaveY
4107,21/06/2018, 11:54 , emre can you piss off?,SamT
4109,21/06/2018, 12:08 , is torreira just a blocking man?,DaveY
4110,21/06/2018, 12:08 , but wilshere gone as well,DaveY
4111,21/06/2018, 12:08 , a mascherano type i think,RobG
4112,21/06/2018, 12:09 , you need that,DaveY
4113,21/06/2018, 12:12 , what about ramsey?,JackG
4114,21/06/2018, 12:12 , yeah ramsey first choice,RobG
4115,21/06/2018, 12:13 , i think banega would be a squad player,RobG
4116,21/06/2018, 12:13 , so never banega?,DaveY
4117,21/06/2018, 12:13 , sometimes banega,RobG
4118,21/06/2018, 12:14 , banega in europa,JackG
4119,21/06/2018, 12:14 , i hope ozil is moved wide. you can do proper pressing with ramsey at number 10,RobG
4120,21/06/2018, 12:16 , how does lacazette play with aubameyang?,DaveY
4121,21/06/2018, 12:17 , they did play pretty well with each other at the end of last season. lacazette starting wide and popping up in the middle whenever aubemeyang dropped off,RobG
4122,21/06/2018, 12:27 , hmm i'd be worried about lack of width if that is the starting team,DaveY
4123,21/06/2018, 12:28 , especially if 4 at back still so no wing backs,DaveY
4124,21/06/2018, 12:30 , bring back the 4-1-2-1-2 worked for ac milan back in the day. very diamond,JackG
4125,21/06/2018, 12:32 , rogers played that year we came 2nd with coutinho at front of diamond behind suarez/sturridge.,DaveY

4127,21/06/2018, 12:45 , i can't wait for 442 and strike partnerships again,RobG
4128,21/06/2018, 12:46 , arguably a good solution to the high press? play over the press with quick and strong forwards latching onto the balls to exploit the space,DaveY
4129,21/06/2018, 12:50 , i think you need two absolute worldwide in the centre of midfield for it against the top sides,RobG
4130,21/06/2018, 12:51 , *worldies,RobG
4131,21/06/2018, 12:59 , but what i like about 442 is the partnerships. partnerships all over the pitch,RobG
4132,21/06/2018, 12:59 , mostly this is nostalgia,RobG
4133,21/06/2018, 13:37 , 5 corners in aus v denmark so far,PaulD
4134,21/06/2018, 13:39 , what would happen to have a heaviky unbalanced formation with both wingers on one side ofthe pitch. just aim to outnumber them on one side and always play the ball out to that side. or when you get the ball everyone runs over to one side of the pitch suddenly?,DaveY
4135,21/06/2018, 14:04 , is this so mental it will work?,PaulD
4136,21/06/2018, 14:09 , nonsense. snarling shitting hound crawling the ball is a much better tactic,PaulD
4137,21/06/2018, 15:56 , i hear they have redone the chequers? have they fucked it?,PaulD

5192,01/07/2018, 18:13 , the hubris of trying to plot ahead will destroy us,DaveY
5193,01/07/2018, 18:14 , a random draw after each round would help prevent hubris,RobG
5194,01/07/2018, 18:14 , save us from ourselves,RobG
5195,01/07/2018, 18:14 , would be intense as well,DaveY
5196,01/07/2018, 18:15 , possible a logistical nightmare? given that there are just 2 days between each round,RobG
5197,01/07/2018, 18:16 , that's what's stopping it? the hotel bookings.,DaveY
5198,01/07/2018, 18:17 , i guess for the fans rather than the teams it could be tricky.,DaveY
5199,01/07/2018, 18:17 , yeah,RobG
5200,01/07/2018, 18:18 , in a country like russia the difference in flight times would be huge depending,RobG
5201,01/07/2018, 18:18 , but no different from now surely? i.e. fans didn't know where our last 16 would be until thursday,DaveY
5202,01/07/2018, 18:19 , ah yeah,RobG
5203,01/07/2018, 18:19 , have to re-book at same notice,DaveY
5204,01/07/2018, 18:19 , so it's only for the teams' benefit,RobG
5205,01/07/2018, 18:19 , well teams as well. no one knew until you know who finishes 1st/2nd,DaveY
5206,01/07/2018, 18:20 , in every other round you know though,RobG
5207,01/07/2018, 18:21 , you could draw the whole route to the final aftee the group stages - so including which last 16 matches end up playing which in quarters etc. then there can still be forward planning but without you having any info at tge group stage,DaveY
5208,01/07/2018, 18:22 , basically the point is to get rid of england-belgium scenarios which that would do,DaveY
5209,01/07/2018, 18:22 , yeah that would be good,RobG
5210,01/07/2018, 19:02 , tuned in 2 minutes late,RobG
5211,01/07/2018, 19:02 , obviously missed a goal,RobG

5231,01/07/2018, 21:53 , 8 are in one half of the draw,RobG
5232,01/07/2018, 21:54 , 1 is in the other... eng-ger-land,RobG
5233,01/07/2018, 22:02 , bilic was proper sulking when they showed his reactions from during the game.,SamT
5234,01/07/2018, 22:03 , looked like he might stab someone,RobG
5235,01/07/2018, 22:03 , you always get the impression bilic might try to sell you a kidney from his jacket pocket,RobG
5236,01/07/2018, 22:20 , thqt must be wrong,DaveY
5237,01/07/2018, 22:23 , surely only brazil uruguay and france in the other half?,DaveY
5238,01/07/2018, 22:24 , i think brazil counts as 5,HamishS
5239,01/07/2018, 22:24 , as in they've won it 5 times,HamishS
5240,01/07/2018, 22:24 , france once,HamishS
5241,01/07/2018, 22:24 , uraguay twice,HamishS
5242,01/07/2018, 22:24 , although jokes on them  cos uraguay have technically won it 4 times,HamishS
5243,01/07/2018, 22:25 , yeah but it was 'winners' not wins?,DaveY
5244,01/07/2018, 22:25 , okay so it is summing wins,DaveY
5245,01/07/2018, 22:26 , true,HamishS
5246,01/07/2018, 22:30 , i can't decide if we're definitely going out to colombia or winning the whole thing. those seem like the only two possible outcomes right now,RobG
5247,01/07/2018, 22:30 , dat hubris,PaulD
5248,01/07/2018, 22:33 , but the hubris is perfectly balanced out by the sense of inevitable failure,RobG
5249,01/07/2018, 23:56 , nah we'll grind out a spot in the final before getting pulverised by france. you heard it here first.,DamianR
5250,01/07/2018, 23:56 , 6-1,DamianR

9210,07/11/2018, 12:23 , whit do?,PhilH
9211,07/11/2018, 12:31 , yeah i think by moving in and paying rent he's implicitly agreed to the tenancy terms. it doesn't necessarily have to be signed to take effect,StefanL
9212,07/11/2018, 12:44 , can the the state of the flat be deemed a breach by the landlord?,SamT

9214,07/11/2018, 12:45 , in all fairness the guy probably should have visited this place before agreeing to live there,DamianR

9220,07/11/2018, 13:31 , that's pretty mental. so you can be living in a dingy dank leaky shithole but if it's inhabitable there's no way to break tenancy early?,DaveY
9221,07/11/2018, 13:36 , would the payment of the rent imply agreement for the terms only for the duration big the rent paid though?,RobG
9222,07/11/2018, 13:50 , he should have got some q and he’d be able to bail himself out of this situation,JackG

9404,14/11/2018, 19:37 , 1. no deal,PhilH
9407,14/11/2018, 19:40 , that's why it will fail. it pleases no one,RobG
9408,14/11/2018, 19:41 , it could please moderates who want brexit but can’t be arsed with it in the commons/news anymore. although they’d be wrong,JackG
9409,14/11/2018, 19:42 , mps will reject it and then it'll be no deal,RobG
9410,14/11/2018, 19:43 , i really doubt mps will reject it without there being some sort of mechanism to avoid no deal,JackG
9411,14/11/2018, 19:43 , which is what may is counting on,JackG
9412,14/11/2018, 19:43 , i'd reject the fuck out of it.,PhilH
9413,14/11/2018, 19:44 , ironic that the hardest brexiteers are those opening a possible door to no brexit,DaveY
9414,14/11/2018, 19:45 , this is why i think she may scrape it through commons by a whisker. unfortunately.,DaveY
9415,14/11/2018, 19:46 , it'll be well tight i think - there are motives on both sides to reject it,RobG
9416,14/11/2018, 19:47 , few labour rebels who fear no deal more than this plus a few brexiters who don't want to compromise the whole thing or open door to general election/second ref swinging behind it.,DaveY

9421,14/11/2018, 21:05 , i think it'll fail in parliament. labour will vote against it (it fails their 6 tests) and so will the rest of the opposition. only then needs the dup or a few tory rebels to rebel and it'll fail.,StefanL
9422,14/11/2018, 21:17 , yeah but that's assuming all labour mps follow whip. can't see that happening especially as loads of them are completely alienated from the leadership anyway.,DaveY
9423,14/11/2018, 21:18 , there are still enough tory remainer and hard brexiteer rebels though,StefanL
9424,14/11/2018, 21:19 , i think they’ll be a leadership election before it gets to a vote anyway tbh,JackG
9425,14/11/2018, 21:21 , that's the question really. do labour pro-deal rebels outnumber tory anti-deal rebels. but she can also bribe them with cushy jobs etc. to bring them around - their anti-deal stance could be partly a bargaining/negotiating chip outside of the real ideologues like mogg.,DaveY

9430,14/11/2018, 22:25 , if there's no clear brexit agreement by the 21st of january then i think parliamentary powers start to kick in. they should be able to force the government to extend article 50 to avoid no deal (i hope),DamianR

10458,18/12/2018, 11:57 , also some of the winning points totals in late 90s early 2000 were really low compared to now,RobG
10459,18/12/2018, 11:57 , football is harder now,RobG
10460,18/12/2018, 12:08 , so mourinhos percentage is better?,PhilH

10466,18/12/2018, 12:23 , hmm looking at that i'd say it's actually pretty consistent apart from the 3 years 96-99.,DaveY
10467,18/12/2018, 12:23 , and man city last season,DaveY
10468,18/12/2018, 12:28 , while general standard has improved throughout,DaveY
10469,18/12/2018, 12:28 , still don't understand how it's easier to win games in an era where the standard of the league has improved,PhilH
10470,18/12/2018, 12:29 , doesn't make sense,PhilH

10474,18/12/2018, 12:38 , we can all agree mourinho is shit though,RobG
10475,18/12/2018, 12:38 , each season the quality of the league changes and so does the relative quality between teams,SamT
10476,18/12/2018, 12:38 , nah,SamT
10477,18/12/2018, 12:38 , i bet ferguson has sleepless nights about his win percentage. not like he has a huge trophy cabinet to cheer himself up with,JackG
10478,18/12/2018, 12:43 , mourinho's pl win % was 53.8. fergie 65.1,SamT

10486,18/12/2018, 14:40 , how is it fergie bashing? it's making the point he operated in a different era which could explain the win percentage. it's mourinho bashing not fergie bashing.,DaveY
10487,18/12/2018, 14:41 , trying to diminish his trophies saying they were 'easier' to win. ridiculous,SamT
10488,18/12/2018, 14:42 , it's not saying that - completely missing the point.,DaveY
10489,18/12/2018, 14:45 , a) rob's words not mine. b) point is that in an era when big clubs have less relative spending power (i.e. pre-globalization of football) then on average the big clubs drop more points. but all the big clubs are doing this so it's no easier to win titles.,DaveY
10490,18/12/2018, 14:47 , haha * not * bashing fergie,RobG
10491,18/12/2018, 14:47 , but the difference between cup and league win ratios more than explains it,RobG
10492,18/12/2018, 14:54 , it’s was sub conscious fergie bashing. your natural underlying anti united bias coming out first,SamT

12396,05/02/2019, 12:54 , just reading this liam neeson story. insane that he didn't that and even more insane that years later he decided to tell the world's media about it completely unprovoked...,DamianR
12397,05/02/2019, 13:30 , or could it have something to do with the injuries to 4 first team players?,DaveY
12398,05/02/2019, 13:32 , no excuse. we’ve got 6 first team injuries,JackG
12399,05/02/2019, 13:44 , well actually we also have 6 including oxlade-chamberlain and lovren,DaveY

12410,05/02/2019, 13:48 , and fabinho can also cover it but he is needed in centre mid due to sudden injureis to hendo and gini.,DaveY
12411,05/02/2019, 13:48 , so in theory we still have 2 good covers but been fucked over by other injuries.,DaveY

14331,08/03/2019, 15:05 , longest time lag between exposure to advert and point of pester,DaveY
14332,08/03/2019, 15:05 , because kids have got so much to think about..,SamT
14333,08/03/2019, 15:06 , so it's only because they see the chomp advert that they guzzle anchomp down? not through seeing the actual chomp in the canteen? are you broken?,DaveY
14334,08/03/2019, 15:08 , dr david tangent,SamT
14335,08/03/2019, 15:08 , chomp billboards?,SamT
14336,08/03/2019, 15:08 , not in schools anymore though are they,PaulD
14337,08/03/2019, 15:09 , how would they know,PaulD
14338,08/03/2019, 15:09 , they never were. never saw a chocolate advert in our school. saw lots of actual chocolate and then bought it,DaveY
14339,08/03/2019, 15:09 , but you don’t get any choc in schools anymore,PaulD
14340,08/03/2019, 15:09 , near schools not in them,RobG
14341,08/03/2019, 15:10 , inner city schools where all the nearby bus stops and tune station carry junk food adverts will have been the target,RobG
14342,08/03/2019, 15:10 , all the chomp bill boards down glyme lane?,DaveY
14343,08/03/2019, 15:11 , all you noobs eating chomps. curly wurly way better,JackG

14346,08/03/2019, 15:12 , build the wall! (in front of the chomp billboard),SamT
14347,08/03/2019, 15:13 , so a fatty is walking to school. really wants some chocolate. 'oh no i've not seen a chomp advert for 300m. i better just order some lettuce'.,DaveY
14348,08/03/2019, 15:13 , a bullshit reform,DaveY
14349,08/03/2019, 15:14 , nothing at all will be impacted by this.,DaveY
14350,08/03/2019, 15:14 , just like how sales of cigarettes went up after they stopped advertising them...,PaulD
14351,08/03/2019, 15:14 , companies wouldn't be buying the adverts if they weren't effective,RobG
14352,08/03/2019, 15:15 , probably short term. far fewer people smoke now,RobG
14353,08/03/2019, 15:15 , no i mean they obviously went down,PaulD
14354,08/03/2019, 15:15 , red herring. we're already going down due to wider societal changes. cant establish causality vs correlation,DaveY
14355,08/03/2019, 15:15 , irony hard to spot in this thread,RobG
14356,08/03/2019, 15:15 , *were,DaveY
14357,08/03/2019, 15:16 , the ellipsis rob the ellipsis. classic irony,PaulD
14358,08/03/2019, 15:17 , need to invent a new punctuation mark. the irony mark,DaveY
14359,08/03/2019, 15:17 , you're basically denying the effectiveness of all advertising dave,RobG
14360,08/03/2019, 15:18 , ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - the irony punctuation mark,PaulD
14361,08/03/2019, 15:18 , absolutely not. specifically placed it in the context of junk food and the 300m perimeter making any difference,DaveY
14362,08/03/2019, 15:19 , ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ dave you cunt ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,RobG
14363,08/03/2019, 15:19 , https://goo.gl/images/tfgbbi,DaveY
14364,08/03/2019, 15:19 , are you able to resist buying one now rob?,DaveY
14365,08/03/2019, 15:20 , but if it was toys it would work? only junk food that happens to be exclusively ineffective,PaulD
14366,08/03/2019, 15:20 , or you've seen that so there's nothing to be done now,DaveY
14367,08/03/2019, 15:20 , i'm eating one now,RobG
14368,08/03/2019, 15:20 , there’s a big difference between advertising and marketing though,JackG
14369,08/03/2019, 15:20 , advertising not so effective,JackG
14370,08/03/2019, 15:20 , this thread is a chomp dream. discussing their brand constantly,RobG
14371,08/03/2019, 15:20 , already been done - it's a reversed question mark,StefanL

14375,08/03/2019, 15:21 , more practical,PaulD
14376,08/03/2019, 15:21 , a real piece of shit,DaveY
14377,08/03/2019, 15:22 , ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,PaulD

14379,08/03/2019, 15:25 , ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,RobG
14380,08/03/2019, 15:25 , idiotic to think that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,PaulD

14382,08/03/2019, 15:29 , yeah i would be thinking about getting a chomp if that was suspended above the albion tavern,RobG
14383,08/03/2019, 15:30 , but you would have seen the actual bar and it's size in the canteen? but the billboard was crucial.,DaveY
14384,08/03/2019, 15:30 , they cant sell them in schools anymore dave,SamT
14385,08/03/2019, 15:31 , the chain chomp got me,JackG

14391,08/03/2019, 15:45 , dr david jargon. marketing expert,SamT
14392,08/03/2019, 15:45 , when will it end?,DaveY
14393,08/03/2019, 15:46 , really need some damo input into this,PaulD
14394,08/03/2019, 15:46 , he casts aside the thread as all about football,PaulD
14395,08/03/2019, 15:50 , not a total layman.,DaveY
14396,08/03/2019, 15:51 , chomp vs stretch armstrong marketing?,SamT
14397,08/03/2019, 15:51 , there's a lot of economic psychology literature about exactly that sort of thing for different products/sectors.,DaveY
14398,08/03/2019, 15:54 , now with a realistic 10 incher,SamT
14399,08/03/2019, 15:54 , stretch dick strong,SamT

14402,08/03/2019, 15:59 , how do you explain tv ads?,PhilH
14403,08/03/2019, 15:59 , bigger screen more pixels more deep black higher k,PhilH
14404,08/03/2019, 16:07 , i like that tv ads for tvs attempt to show the leap in quality to you on your existing screen,RobG
14405,08/03/2019, 16:08 , it will look exactly the same as what you were already seeing,RobG
14406,08/03/2019, 16:30 , like the algorithms on shopping websites that recommend the exact same thing that you just bought. no thanks,JackG
14407,08/03/2019, 16:30 , damian can you have a word,PaulD
14408,08/03/2019, 17:45 , var debate anyone?,SamT

14410,08/03/2019, 17:46 , (and petrol),SamT
14411,08/03/2019, 17:46 , slow motion makes everything look bad,JackG
14412,08/03/2019, 17:46 , next,JackG
14413,08/03/2019, 17:47 , you’ve got to look at the whole clip.,SamT
14414,08/03/2019, 17:47 , kimpembe knows what he’s doing when he jumps and turns his body,SamT
14415,08/03/2019, 17:48 , arm string outwards whilst turning,SamT
14416,08/03/2019, 17:48 , it’s a good concept. need the refs to get used to it though,JackG
14417,08/03/2019, 17:49 , you can imagine mike dean dragging out a var decision just for the drama,JackG
14418,08/03/2019, 17:50 , i think they are now. wednesday highlighted that some of the rules are overly complicated. uefa said the pen decision is correct according to the rules.,SamT
14419,08/03/2019, 17:50 , mike dean was born to var,SamT
14420,08/03/2019, 17:52 , i agree it was a pen,JackG
14421,08/03/2019, 17:52 , ironic that var was brought in to reduce controversy though,JackG
14422,08/03/2019, 17:52 , ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,JackG
14423,08/03/2019, 17:55 , ¯\_(ツ)_/¯,PaulD
14424,08/03/2019, 17:58 , sorry your goal is ruled out because aguero got fouled at 36 minutes which led to a free kick which led to the corner that the counter attack was launched from which ended in a penalty,JackG
14425,08/03/2019, 17:58 , well i just meant about 5 frames back rather than a still on the moment it touches the arm,SamT
14426,08/03/2019, 18:00 , quick free kick/corners are penalised. have to choose that or var review,SamT
14427,08/03/2019, 18:00 , maybe it should be like tennis where both teams get two var reviews per half,JackG
14428,08/03/2019, 18:01 , it's gone too var in my opinion.,PhilH
14429,08/03/2019, 18:01 , too slow though. in tennis a single player decides for themselves. are the coaching staff going deliberate before using a var call,SamT
14430,08/03/2019, 18:02 , football clubs would start employing var analysts,JackG
14431,08/03/2019, 18:04 , in rugby it’s all on the refs and tmo. so the tmo is constantly reviewing the match footage and flags stuff up for the ref to review. works really well,JackG
14432,08/03/2019, 18:05 , that’s the way var is though. rugby rules are clearer and less subjective,SamT
14433,08/03/2019, 18:13 , also you don’t get the players kicking off at the ref. need to stamp that out,JackG
14434,08/03/2019, 18:16 , think they should introduce challenges like in tennis. teams start with 3 challenges and captain can send a decision to review. lose it if onfield decision was right. keeps a lid on it being used for trivial shit and takes away subjectivity of ref in when to call for it.,DaveY
14435,08/03/2019, 18:18 , ah just read up and jack just said that,DaveY
14436,08/03/2019, 18:18 , void. i lose a challenge,DaveY
14437,08/03/2019, 18:19 , in football would you give challenge rights to the captain or manager? how do you prevent conferring,SamT
14438,08/03/2019, 18:19 , captain,DaveY
14439,08/03/2019, 18:19 , and has to do it within e.g. 10 seconds of incident,DaveY
14440,08/03/2019, 18:20 , so reduced scope for conferral,DaveY
14441,08/03/2019, 18:20 , can take quick opinion from teammates,SamT
14442,08/03/2019, 18:20 , also like the idea of giving captain role more meaning again,DaveY
14443,08/03/2019, 18:20 , yeah defo,SamT
14444,08/03/2019, 18:23 , i think every player needs a drone cam permanently 1 ft above their heads,RobG

14476,08/03/2019, 18:36 , i'm a big fan of the craft beer trend in the way that it's led to tiny cornershops stocking loads of different beers on permanent 3 for £x deals. it's fun just rinsing a few on a friday night and seeing what's good,RobG
14477,08/03/2019, 18:37 , (though i 💗 stella obvs),SamT

15001,16/03/2019, 21:55 , but meaningless,HamishS
15002,16/03/2019, 21:57 , would live brighton to win the fa cup,HamishS
15003,16/03/2019, 21:57 , e.g. that season everton finished 4th and got dumped out in qualifiers. they would rather have had silverware to cap that era,DaveY
15004,16/03/2019, 21:57 , the biggest thing tonight is var,SamT

15007,16/03/2019, 21:58 , wot???,SamT
15008,16/03/2019, 21:59 , yeah but they would take that over scrotting around for 1/2 more relegation battles while winning nothing,DaveY
15009,16/03/2019, 21:59 , look at the fury at puel this season for not caring about the cup,DaveY
15010,16/03/2019, 21:59 , fa cup has more meaning outside top 4,HamishS
15011,16/03/2019, 22:06 , how many good moments has he actually given the fans though? a couple of nice wins in the champions league i guess. but they’ve not even got to cup final and regularly embarrass themselves,JackG
15012,16/03/2019, 22:07 , getting ahead of arsenal in the league would have been big for spurs fans,DaveY

15016,16/03/2019, 22:10 , i'd prefer to be spurs personally,HamishS
15017,16/03/2019, 22:11 , fa cup would be great,JackG
15018,16/03/2019, 22:11 , his is like that delayed gratification  experiment they did on children,HamishS
15019,16/03/2019, 22:12 , false choice. you could win an fa cup in the context of improving generally and comibg 4th. then the fa cup would be a great market of that era,DaveY
15020,16/03/2019, 22:12 , *marker,DaveY
15021,16/03/2019, 22:13 , yeah maybe. it can crown and encapsulate a broader period of quality/sucess,DaveY
15022,16/03/2019, 22:13 , which would feel empty without any trophy,DaveY
15023,16/03/2019, 22:13 , but that period of success is defined by other perameters,HamishS
15024,16/03/2019, 22:14 , not the cup itself,HamishS
15025,16/03/2019, 22:14 , the footballing equivalent of a wank,HamishS
15026,16/03/2019, 22:15 , perhaps footballers are less bothered about whether they get trophies these days as well due to getting a shit tonne of money,JackG
15027,16/03/2019, 22:15 , but you are more likely to win the cup due to being good generally. so it's related to that same improvement,DaveY
15028,16/03/2019, 22:15 , and shows you have that ability to perform in key moments which is also a mark of great teams,DaveY
15029,16/03/2019, 22:16 , fa cup couldn't save wenger,HamishS
15030,16/03/2019, 22:16 , which i think is the most damning evidence against it,HamishS
15031,16/03/2019, 22:17 , e.g. ronaldo is partly so good because he does it in key moments and finals.,DaveY
15032,16/03/2019, 22:17 , 3 fa cups too,JackG
15033,16/03/2019, 22:52 , but then on the flip side i actually enjoyed the arsenal team a lot during the trophy drought. we had really excellent young players we'd brought through ourselves and played better football than we did in those last wenger seasons with the 3 cups,RobG

15571,31/03/2019, 17:25 , salt sans iodine,PhilH
15572,31/03/2019, 17:27 , the term kosher salt gained common usage in north america and refers to its use in the jewish religious practice of dry brining meats—known as koshering or kashering—as opposed to the salt itself being manufactured under religious guidelines.,PhilH

15576,01/04/2019, 13:02 , the suspensions on that.,DaveY
15577,01/04/2019, 13:37 , theoretical maximum straight red cards would be 10 - 3 games suspended each time and then the game you get sent off in each time would be 37 games.,DaveY
15578,01/04/2019, 13:37 , so he's at half that,DaveY
15579,01/04/2019, 13:37 , although looks like one was in europe,DaveY
15580,01/04/2019, 13:42 , presumably you'd need to be scoring a hat-trick and winning the match in each of the games you got sent off in to justify re-election every time. would be quite a season,DaveY
15581,01/04/2019, 13:49 , he may also have received additional suspensions for getting 5 yellows in either or both halves of the season,RobG
15582,01/04/2019, 13:51 , i'm imagining just 10 hat-trick match-winning performances but with a violent conduct straight red in each.,DaveY

15902,07/04/2019, 21:19 , i call bullshit. you can't have consumed more than your own volume,JamesB
15903,07/04/2019, 21:21 , having just googled that the human body contains only one gallon of blood that seems a  reasonable assessment haha!,DamianR
15904,07/04/2019, 21:22 , how much is a gallon?,PhilH
15905,07/04/2019, 21:22 , ah 4.5 litres,PhilH
15906,07/04/2019, 21:23 , seems a reasonable amount of booze,PhilH
15907,07/04/2019, 21:23 , 8 pints,PhilH
15908,07/04/2019, 21:24 , i just meant that damo's total volume is less than 2 gallons,JamesB
15909,07/04/2019, 21:25 , so he drank half his own blood volume?,DaveY
15910,07/04/2019, 21:25 , double,JamesB
15911,07/04/2019, 21:27 , i guess you are constantly pissing,DaveY

15913,07/04/2019, 21:27 , he was more cider than man by the end,DaveY
15914,07/04/2019, 21:29 , it's possible he was maybe going pelican and storing it all in a neck pouch to digest as required,JamesB
15915,07/04/2019, 21:30 , we've all drunk way more than 2 gallons in an evening,RobG

15929,08/04/2019, 12:46 , feel like this would be a huge wales conversation,RobG
15930,08/04/2019, 12:47 , essentially your mouth and anus are directly linked via pipe. if you were 2d rather than 3d a pipe would be drawn as just two unconnected parallel lines thus dividing you in half.,JamesB
15931,08/04/2019, 12:48 , 'fun fact',DaveY
15932,08/04/2019, 12:49 , one for parties and funerals,JamesB
15933,08/04/2019, 12:49 , so you get to see the digestion and shit generation in action,PaulD
15934,08/04/2019, 12:49 , presumably then you'd only have blood and air supply on one side of your body,StefanL
15935,08/04/2019, 12:49 , but hold on your anus is connected to itself,DaveY
15936,08/04/2019, 12:50 , at all points,DaveY
15937,08/04/2019, 12:50 , cut down middle one lung only,PaulD
15938,08/04/2019, 12:51 , i suppose this is only a problem if you're 2d in a 3d world,RobG
15939,08/04/2019, 12:51 , because of the mouth-anus divide,StefanL
15940,08/04/2019, 12:51 , shit pipe blocks all,PaulD
15941,08/04/2019, 12:51 , essentially you'd be a walking ct scan,JamesB
15942,08/04/2019, 12:52 , and israel and palestine think they've got it rough,JamesB
15943,08/04/2019, 12:52 , i was thinking more like if you unwrapped a human and flattened it to 2d form. this seems more like taking a 2d cross-section,DaveY
15944,08/04/2019, 12:53 , 2d cross section is how you'd appear in the second dimension,JamesB
15945,08/04/2019, 12:53 , lol,StefanL
15946,08/04/2019, 12:53 , unwrapping a human,StefanL
15947,08/04/2019, 12:54 ," ie we perceive the 4th dimension (time) as continually changing snapshots or ""slices"" if you will",JamesB
15948,08/04/2019, 12:54 , hold on - fly in the ointment. the top of the head above the mouth is still connected to both sides,DaveY
15949,08/04/2019, 12:55 , ah yes that is true but still fundamentally divided in haf,JamesB
15950,08/04/2019, 12:55 , so everything would have to flow through the brain,DaveY
15951,08/04/2019, 12:56 , i guess a 2d being would perceive us as tentacle monsters,JamesB
15952,08/04/2019, 12:56 , huge bottleneck in the brain with having to process all bloodflow from side to side,DaveY
15953,08/04/2019, 12:56 , with a large central brain at the top,JamesB
15954,08/04/2019, 12:57 , the downward pressure would quickly mean the two sides seperated so that you are supported on the floor by either sides of your intestines and at the center by the roof of your mouth.,DaveY
15955,08/04/2019, 12:58 , have not - should i?,JamesB
15956,08/04/2019, 12:59 ," i like that this has now become a design consultation - ""the perfect 2d human""",JamesB
15957,08/04/2019, 12:59 , we need more shit valves,JamesB
15958,08/04/2019, 13:01 , but couldnt open all the blood gates at once otherwise intantly split down the middle again. so have to open them one at a time to let shit through like canal locks,DaveY
15959,08/04/2019, 13:01 , slaughterhouse 5 also relevant,RobG
15960,08/04/2019, 13:01 , quite tenuous - that's more to do with time being non-linear,DaveY
15961,08/04/2019, 13:02 , but the bit where he talks to the aliens about how they experience time as a dimension they can move through is relevant,RobG
15962,08/04/2019, 13:03 , do not recall the shit pipe problem being covered extensively,DaveY
15963,08/04/2019, 13:04 , is only covered by the finest theologians,JamesB
15964,08/04/2019, 13:04 , the shit pipe paradox,JamesB

16301,11/04/2019, 14:29 , there's your answer,DamianR
16302,11/04/2019, 14:30 , can you translate it into a real answer?,PaulD
16303,11/04/2019, 14:31 , that makes sense. still quite close - orbiting every 16 light years. big risk of being sucked into the event horizon there surely,DaveY

16315,11/04/2019, 14:50 , would orbiting a sun that's orbiting a black hole with a big disc of glazing gas around it mean you don't have a regular day/night cycle,RobG

16320,11/04/2019, 14:56 , don't see the issue,DaveY
16321,11/04/2019, 14:59 , you just get to see loads of gas whizzing around and a big black disc of nothing/everything,RobG
16322,11/04/2019, 15:00 , probably the continuous stream of x-rays/gamma rays coming out of the super heated infalling mater as it crosses the event horizon,DamianR
16323,11/04/2019, 15:00 , ah. well.,DaveY
16324,11/04/2019, 15:01 , but that's 12x further away than the sun,RobG
16325,11/04/2019, 15:01 , just more to look at.,DaveY
16326,11/04/2019, 15:01 , x-rays used in medicine anyway - good for you if anything,DaveY
16327,11/04/2019, 15:02 , would just see through everyone it would be a good gimick for the night,DaveY

16337,11/04/2019, 15:41 , why aren't we already targetting radio messages to the nearest habitable-looking exoplanets,DaveY
16338,11/04/2019, 15:42 , good point,PaulD
16339,11/04/2019, 15:47 , i think we're doing a bit of that,RobG

16342,11/04/2019, 15:55 , sent it in 1974,PaulD
16343,11/04/2019, 15:57 , so if they reply immediately we'll hear back in 3174?,RobG
16344,11/04/2019, 15:58 , in 49974,PaulD
16345,11/04/2019, 16:05 , if there were any intelligent lifeforms within a reasonable distance to us we would have already have picked up thier passive comms (for example tv and radio) by now (and them us),DamianR
16346,11/04/2019, 16:08 , only if they're further ahead technologically by the number of light years away they are,RobG
16347,11/04/2019, 16:10 , or maybe they sent it to use before we built anything to receive it,RobG
16348,11/04/2019, 16:13 , could be a lot of life that's been and gone,RobG
16349,11/04/2019, 16:16 , i read somewhere that untargetted signals like that would only be detectable 0.25 light years away so not enough to pick up,DaveY
16350,11/04/2019, 16:18 , they could well have died out in the time it takes for their reply signal to get here anyway.,DaveY
16351,11/04/2019, 16:20 , but this is fuck all. 20 in total over decades. we should be constantly spamming out messages to the nearest ones. go for volume.,DaveY
16352,11/04/2019, 16:24 , do tv and radio signals just get spaffed out?,RobG
16353,11/04/2019, 16:24 , take all of the shit memes @447540496004  has produced on the thread and channel it straight at  alpha centuri. it's the strongest signal we have...,DamianR

16603,13/04/2019, 22:34 , surely we’ve gone mental and should just brine all foods we want to be salty in a cup of seawater over night rather than extracting salt from water,PaulD
16604,13/04/2019, 22:35 , canarian potatoes are boiled in sea water until all the liquid is gone and they're crusted with salt,RobG
16605,13/04/2019, 22:36 , and therefore fucking delicious,RobG
16606,13/04/2019, 22:36 , we’re doing salt wrong,PaulD
16607,13/04/2019, 22:37 , cut out the middle man - go straight to the seawater.,DaveY
16608,13/04/2019, 22:37 , water water everywhere,PaulD
16609,13/04/2019, 22:38 , sea water hard to come by in much of the country,RobG
16610,13/04/2019, 22:38 , chipping norton for example,RobG
16611,13/04/2019, 22:38 , salt easier to transport,RobG
16612,13/04/2019, 22:38 , so we're wanting pure water and pure salt - but then we just combine them in meals anyway. why not just drink seawater with meals. can't see any problem with that.,DaveY
16613,13/04/2019, 22:39 , but the salt's coming from the sea anyway rob,DaveY
16614,13/04/2019, 22:39 , and you get water for free,PaulD
16615,13/04/2019, 22:39 , so you're transporting it to a plant to make salt and then transporting the salt,DaveY
16616,13/04/2019, 22:40 , train to watch train,PaulD
16617,13/04/2019, 22:40 , has anyone actually tried soaking everything in seawater or are we just going on the old wives tale that you can't drink it?,DaveY
16618,13/04/2019, 22:41 , don’t think it’s been tested,PaulD
16619,13/04/2019, 22:41 , a lot of outdated information holding us back,DaveY
16620,13/04/2019, 22:41 , i eat salt i drink water ergo let me have sea water,PaulD
16621,13/04/2019, 22:42 , i'll get sea water shipped and stop buying salt,RobG
16622,13/04/2019, 22:42 , yeah - have both of them seperately all the time. just save one step in the process,DaveY
16623,13/04/2019, 22:42 , if we can pipe in fresh water with all difficult treatment; just pipe in sea water,PaulD
16624,13/04/2019, 22:43 , cost saving. twice as useful,PaulD
16625,13/04/2019, 22:43 , add pepper as its piped in,PaulD
16626,13/04/2019, 22:43 , the amount of truck hours and petrol that would be saved in delivering all the salt,DaveY
16627,13/04/2019, 22:43 , lol so seasoned water through all taps,DaveY
16628,13/04/2019, 22:44 , pre-seasoned,DaveY
16629,13/04/2019, 22:44 , add generic spices,PaulD
16630,13/04/2019, 22:44 , exploring the world by ship would have gone so much better if they'd just ignored that stupid wives' tale and drunk the water,RobG
16631,13/04/2019, 22:44 , no one uses all the nutmeg or cinnamon,PaulD
16632,13/04/2019, 22:44 , and a few potatoes and beef come in through the tap as well,DaveY
16633,13/04/2019, 22:44 , in fact you end up with a nice salty roast dinner,DaveY

17026,24/04/2019, 20:39 , auba not in the squad probably points towards a knock,RobG

17028,24/04/2019, 20:40 , injury to ramsay has brought him in,RobG
17029,24/04/2019, 20:41 , wolves are great though to be fair against top 6. could destroy liverpool on the last match of the season,JackG

17033,24/04/2019, 21:26 , i'll just leave 3 players free and track into a region where my centre back is already standing,DaveY

17054,26/04/2019, 10:25 , just looking into george best - that post-united career. really got away from him.,DaveY
17055,26/04/2019, 10:32 , heads straight for the jewish guild. age 27. makes 5 appearences. then who should come knocking but dunstable town on a loan deal.,DaveY
17056,26/04/2019, 12:01 , made 5 appearances for bournemouth at the age of 37,HamishS
17057,26/04/2019, 12:03 , 4 clubs in 1983,RobG
17058,26/04/2019, 12:04 , had a little late rennaisance at san jose earthquakes though. pops in 21 goals in the 80-81 season,DaveY
17059,26/04/2019, 12:15 , i wish they'd recorded a pints to goals ratio,RobG
17060,26/04/2019, 12:28 , surely boozy centre backs would just dominate though,DaveY
17061,26/04/2019, 12:28 , your tony adams,DaveY
17062,26/04/2019, 12:28 , his ratio would be obscene,DaveY
17063,26/04/2019, 12:37 , tony ten pints' ratio would be correspondingly poor,RobG
17064,26/04/2019, 13:47 , https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6954283/change-uk-group-plots-destroy-lib-dems.html,DamianR
17065,26/04/2019, 13:49 , i was cautiously optimistic about the tig party but not anymore. they all resigned to fight brexit but instead they have made it thier priority to fight the other anti brexit party despite our offer to work together. i hope they all get spanked at the next general election...,DamianR
17066,26/04/2019, 13:50 , so e.g. gazza's career comes out better than pele's because of the pints he got in while doing it.,DaveY
17067,26/04/2019, 13:52 , turns out you can be a remainer and still be a fucking racist,StefanL
17068,26/04/2019, 13:54 , yeah fucking hate tig. self-important pricks - there are already 2 committed remain uk parties (green and lib dem) plus snp and plaid if that's your voting preference. they have just splintered it further and made brexit party more likely to clean up.,DaveY
17069,26/04/2019, 13:55 , plus they are vacuous third way tossers,DaveY
17070,26/04/2019, 14:00 , wasnt there a thing with adams where he stopped drinking and his form collapsed? or stops being influential in the dressing room. so boozing actually key to his success.,DaveY
17071,26/04/2019, 14:53 , adams did say the best game of his life was while pissed i tbink,RobG
17072,26/04/2019, 14:54 , possibly euro 96 semi,RobG
17073,26/04/2019, 14:59 , imagine trying to mark someone called kuntz while smashed,JackG
17074,26/04/2019, 15:08 , it could have been the intervening jail sentence. i'm sure i was overly aware of it all at the time,RobG

17089,28/04/2019, 13:38 , were doing pretty well until april,DaveY
17090,28/04/2019, 13:39 , then the old 5 losses in 6 premier league games.,DaveY
17091,28/04/2019, 13:39 , (if they lose this game),DaveY

17107,30/04/2019, 14:19 , and going for both names still.,DaveY
17108,30/04/2019, 14:19 , fucking pick one,DaveY
17109,30/04/2019, 14:20 , no time for them.,DaveY
17110,30/04/2019, 14:30 , i've gone full circle on chukka. when labour were in power i thought he was smug and stuck up prick. under miliband i thought he was a whiny prick. under corbyn he actually came across as a fairly reasonable prick. now in change uk he's reverted to a smug and stuck up prick.,DamianR
17111,30/04/2019, 14:31 , it’s all very petty,JackG
17112,30/04/2019, 14:43 , they've managed to completely conform to the sitting on the fence stereotype that dogs centrist politics with with a logo that looks like a fence and a name that's a compromise between two options,RobG
17113,30/04/2019, 14:44 , both of which are themselves bland and non-commital,DaveY
17114,30/04/2019, 14:45 , it looks like they've redacted half of their own name as well.,DaveY

17116,30/04/2019, 17:11 , back to game of thrones briefly. my many years of playing rome total war has me raising serious eye brows at jon snow's battle plan. i mean you have a massive castle... so let's put our artillery outside of it in our front line so they can literally only get one shot away before getting over run. such noobs...,DamianR
17117,30/04/2019, 17:13 , also why send the cavalry off i  advance,HamishS
17118,30/04/2019, 17:13 , amateurs,HamishS
17119,30/04/2019, 17:21 , poor use of dragons,RobG
17120,30/04/2019, 17:24 , not great tactics from the night king either though,StefanL
17121,30/04/2019, 17:25 , didn't get his bodyguards to check for little girls hiding in the bushes,StefanL
17122,30/04/2019, 17:25 , the other white walker could surely have done some work at some point,RobG
17123,30/04/2019, 17:27 , we know how the white king was created,SamT
17124,30/04/2019, 17:29 , i want to see what the lord of light is about. was he just wanting to help kill night king or more?,SamT
17125,30/04/2019, 17:33 , i’m hoping that grrm is also cheesed off at everything and he’ll be motivated to actually finish the books now,JackG
17126,30/04/2019, 17:35 , yeah bran's whole story arc now pointless,DaveY
17127,30/04/2019, 17:36 , it was a real dry hump of a resolution,DaveY
17128,30/04/2019, 17:37 , although i am glad all those fucking years of watching arya scrub the fucking floor as an assassin's apprentice paid off,RobG
17129,30/04/2019, 17:37 , it just felt arbitrary - no attempt to link it into all of the lore they have built up over 100s of hours of my life,DaveY
17130,30/04/2019, 17:38 , jon snow pointless. dragons pointless.,DaveY
17131,30/04/2019, 17:39 , the writing/directing definitely has a marked drop in quality since they’ve gone beyond the material of the existing books.,JackG
17132,30/04/2019, 17:40 , how did arya even know where he was? and how did she fight out of a castle over-run with 1000s of reanimated corpses in a few minutes?,DaveY
17133,30/04/2019, 17:41 , on her own,DaveY
17134,30/04/2019, 17:42 , she knew he was going for bran and where bran was. i got the impression that she had jumped from a rooftop nearby the room we last saw her in,RobG
17135,30/04/2019, 17:43 , hence why the red woman was in there,RobG
17136,30/04/2019, 17:43 , but everyone else knew he was there,DaveY
17137,30/04/2019, 17:43 , no reason to try and go there? only she thought of it,DaveY
17138,30/04/2019, 17:44 , the red woman told her to,RobG
17139,30/04/2019, 17:44 , was he that close to the castle that you can just jump there from the roof?!,DaveY
17140,30/04/2019, 17:44 , definitely never established that and if so everyone would see that ages ago,DaveY
17141,30/04/2019, 17:44 , she must have jumped from a height to get that height,RobG
17142,30/04/2019, 17:45 , so he was just hanging out at the base of the castle - no one from either side realised?,DaveY
17143,30/04/2019, 17:50 , lure the night king,SamT
17144,30/04/2019, 17:50 , he was craters for bran,SamT
17145,30/04/2019, 17:52 , this is how they filmed it https://twitter.com/yahtimest/status/1123100417754324992?s=08,StefanL
17146,30/04/2019, 17:57 , also  for the battlb7e?,DaveY
17147,30/04/2019, 17:57 , what does bran do now? he's a freak with only one purpose in the world and it's been achieved,RobG
17148,30/04/2019, 17:57 , he's immediately post referendum farage,RobG
17149,30/04/2019, 17:58 , perhaps remainers will bring the white walkers back,RobG
17150,30/04/2019, 18:01 , so that was the whole basis of the battle plan. but relies on the red lady whispering it to arya stark on the off chance?,DaveY
17151,30/04/2019, 18:01 , great fucking communication strategy,DaveY
17152,30/04/2019, 18:01 , and no one else was told where he would be,DaveY
17153,30/04/2019, 18:08 , everyone was told where he would be in the planning meeting.,SamT
17154,30/04/2019, 18:08 , arya was there,SamT
17155,30/04/2019, 18:09 , end of last episode,SamT

17165,30/04/2019, 19:53 , i googled and an article suggested i might orgasm to the noise of a man eating kfc,RobG
17166,30/04/2019, 19:53 , is that what you meant?,RobG
17167,30/04/2019, 19:53 , no thankyou,HamishS
17168,30/04/2019, 19:53 , haven't seen that particular video,DaveY
17169,30/04/2019, 19:54 , there's another three episodes right? not sure they are how they are going to fill them. surely dany goes kings landing but then realised she only has an army of 12 major characters who were somehow able to survive people the battle. gets fucked by cersi. game over.,DamianR
17170,30/04/2019, 19:55 , i watched a couple of some scottish girl doing it,JamesB
17171,30/04/2019, 19:55 , i get the idea of it,JamesB
17172,30/04/2019, 19:55 , but no orgasms - yet,JamesB
17173,30/04/2019, 19:56 , nah it's more spine tingles sort of works. there was one guy doing some very intense ones,DaveY
17174,30/04/2019, 19:57 , yeah it's taps into some kind of deep rooted catatonic thing i think,JamesB
17175,30/04/2019, 19:57 , like massaging a chicken to make it all asleep,JamesB

19411,07/07/2019, 17:38 , its fucking with everyone's sense of what's a goal or not,HamishS

19414,07/07/2019, 17:38 , fans don't know what's happening,DaveY
19415,07/07/2019, 17:39 , arbitrary marginal offside aswell,HamishS
19416,07/07/2019, 17:39 , morally onside,HamishS
19417,07/07/2019, 17:40 , they should make offside easier for attackers. make it so that that any overlap between players equals onsode,HamishS
19418,07/07/2019, 17:41 , yeah,DaveY
19419,07/07/2019, 17:41 , because also offside is designed to prevent goal hanging not to give huge advantage to defenders,DaveY
19420,07/07/2019, 17:41 , would probably stop any side from playing a high line ever though,HamishS
19421,07/07/2019, 17:42 , makes the offside trap too easy to play now it's refereed like this,DaveY
19422,07/07/2019, 17:43 , also this thing of any handball in the box no matter how close or inadvertant or close to the body is a penno,DaveY
19423,07/07/2019, 17:44 , maybe need a form of punishment less severe like an indirect free kick in the box,DaveY
19424,07/07/2019, 17:44 , differentiate between accidental and not,HamishS
19425,07/07/2019, 17:46 , and to keep checks to a mimimum,DaveY
19426,07/07/2019, 17:49 , have to say what you think was wrong,DaveY
19427,07/07/2019, 17:49 , i.e. 'im challenging - number 7 was offside',DaveY
19428,07/07/2019, 17:57 , going to be a lot more set piece goals this season i guess,DaveY
19429,07/07/2019, 17:57 , because defenders will be scared of being to physical so will be easier to find space in the box,DaveY
19430,07/07/2019, 17:57 , maybe this is what triggers the return of 4-4-2,DaveY
19431,07/07/2019, 17:58 , would be somewhat ironic,DaveY
19432,07/07/2019, 17:58 , sends us back to the dark ages,DaveY
19433,07/07/2019, 18:00 , although just as we've all abandoned that style of football,DaveY
19434,07/07/2019, 18:00 , it will somehow work against us,DaveY
19435,07/07/2019, 21:20 , i think part of the problem is that the very culture of football is about pushing the rules to absolute limit and beyond when ever you can. the current rules are very hard to enforced to the letter by the refs in real time and because everyone is doing it a large number of offences are allowed to pass. var ends that by allowing proper scrutiny and the result is a very stop start game where players who are routinely cheating are getting caught when previously they wouldn't have. i think the rules need to change to reflect this but so does the culture of football - the accidental handball in the penalty area is a good example of this. at the end of the day playing competitively and fairly without gamesmanship is preferable to old way that drives an 'do anything to win' attitude and fuels widespread disdain for the officials.,DamianR

20609,09/08/2019, 14:58 , can’t wait for there to be a controversial var decision tonight. i ❤ var,JackG
20610,09/08/2019, 15:01 , var is shit. runing football.,DaveY
20611,09/08/2019, 15:01 , no more offside goals from salah 👌,JackG
20612,09/08/2019, 15:06 , not aware of this being a  significant issue,HamishS
20613,09/08/2019, 15:08 , with var salah would have scored 3 goals,RobG
20614,09/08/2019, 15:09 , it is known,RobG
20615,09/08/2019, 15:12 , rainman rob strikes again,JackG
20616,09/08/2019, 15:19 , you'd be more on the mark if you focussed on his soft penno's,DaveY
20617,09/08/2019, 15:21 , they’ve also changed the handball rules for this season. watch pundits still not be able to agree on whether something is handball or not,JackG
20618,09/08/2019, 15:24 , no gaps in play. you have to try to win by more than one goal,RobG
20619,09/08/2019, 15:27 , yeah,RobG
20620,09/08/2019, 15:27 , i'm just going to leave this here...,DamianR
20621,09/08/2019, 15:27 , so if you score a dodgy -seeming goal you feel like you need another as insurance,RobG
20622,09/08/2019, 15:29 , what happens if someone got a red card unfairly?,JackG
20623,09/08/2019, 15:30 , the entire game would have to be re-modelled in a simulation to remove all of their subsequent touches and see how the game panned out.,DaveY
20624,09/08/2019, 15:31 , lol,JackG
20625,09/08/2019, 15:31 , replay for the remaining minutes,RobG
20626,09/08/2019, 15:31 , everyone in the crowd has to come back to recreate the exact atmosphere,RobG
20627,09/08/2019, 15:31 , nah huge computer simulation to determine who won.,DaveY
20628,09/08/2019, 15:31 , ok,RobG
20629,09/08/2019, 15:31 , sure,RobG
20630,09/08/2019, 15:32 , so most games are now just simulated. any game that had an overturned decision has to be modelled virtually.,DaveY
20631,09/08/2019, 15:34 , or you can broadcast all simulations each game week. go to the pub to watch a computer churn out a result,JackG
20632,09/08/2019, 15:35 , so they can input actual weather conditions,RobG
20633,09/08/2019, 15:36 , the game takes weeks to play. then you assess with var which version sould actually be picked as the result.,DaveY
20634,09/08/2019, 15:38 , how does the data on player statistics and attributes come from if no games are being played though. would we eventually end up watching randomly generated players like in fm?,DaveY
20635,09/08/2019, 15:44 , ah right yeah,DaveY
20636,09/08/2019, 15:44 , so still playing matches but just behind doors to generate the data,DaveY
20637,09/08/2019, 16:13 , yeah yeah,RobG
20638,09/08/2019, 16:14 , they're like people who've had films based on their life,RobG
20639,09/08/2019, 16:14 , i would love for delia to do another drunken half-time speech tonight,RobG
20640,09/08/2019, 16:48 , what’s the impact on wages and sponsorship? are they represented as a badly rendered computer sprite. people have posters of them up rather than the actual person,PaulD
20641,09/08/2019, 16:48 , a grainy player on the footy man pitch in the simulation,PaulD

20652,09/08/2019, 20:02 , yeah damo you'd have found that out by reading any preview,RobG

20672,09/08/2019, 21:03 , somewhat mediated by having by van dijk and trent,DamianR
20673,09/08/2019, 21:04 , my model didn't have a feature for inexplicably leaving you best player from last season on the bench,DamianR

20705,10/08/2019, 10:17 , if he can’t be flogged in this window then he’ll have to be a back up player,SamT
20706,10/08/2019, 10:17 , that's mental,DaveY
20707,10/08/2019, 10:19 , has to be done to make a statement that united won’t pay silly wages to get a big name anymore. if you don’t perform you’re out. sanchez is that last one of those signing left,SamT
20708,10/08/2019, 10:21 , you did well to get so much cash back for lukaku,JackG

20720,10/08/2019, 13:17 , they make fouls high up the pitch because your more likely to get booked the closer they get to goal,HamishS

20822,11/08/2019, 19:50 , he defined it as higher consciousness,RobG
20823,11/08/2019, 19:50 , he just loves blood in his brain,RobG
20824,11/08/2019, 19:50 , will do anything for more blood there,RobG
20825,11/08/2019, 19:50 , how does it work in terms of drilling through the skull?,PaulD
20826,11/08/2019, 19:51 , his brains out there for the world,PaulD

20831,11/08/2019, 20:01 , i think you leave the skin and let it heal over the hole,RobG
20832,11/08/2019, 20:08 , still quite mental,PaulD
20833,11/08/2019, 21:42 , very reassuring to have the skin regrow over the hole,StefanL
20834,11/08/2019, 21:43 , babies have that hole in their skull - presumably they're 30% high all the time,StefanL
20835,11/08/2019, 21:43 , yes that was actually a point he made,RobG

20840,11/08/2019, 21:47 , i don’t get how drilling a hole equals more brain blood,PaulD

20842,11/08/2019, 22:01 , it gives your blood vessels more room and makes the whole skull less rigid so there is more room,RobG

21553,29/08/2019, 16:40 , hopefully can make change one minute after the deadline before he has fallen in value - the are a lot of transfers in that will need to be cancelled out before he starts slipping,RobG

21565,29/08/2019, 16:47 , yeah i read somewhere they happen at 1am. maximum 0.1 up or down  a day. they have to cross a threshold of a certain amount of transfers to trigger it,DaveY

21578,29/08/2019, 16:58 , this is turning into mass hysteria. martial is fine. no price changes,PaulD
21579,29/08/2019, 17:05 , for falls it can also be a % of ownership threshold,DaveY
21580,29/08/2019, 17:06 , net transfers - absolute for rises. absolute or % of ownership whichever happens first for falls,DaveY
21581,29/08/2019, 17:09 , you win some you lose some on price rises. i would say losing 4 points is maybe not worth saving 0.1 million,RobG
21582,29/08/2019, 17:10 , you’ve got to think of the knock on as well though. you’d have to use your transfer next week on martial rather than doing the one you’d planned to improve your team,JackG

23010,13/10/2019, 17:50 , specific non generic source,PaulD
23011,13/10/2019, 17:52 , the fact that people needed to write articles about it says enough. if i was enjoying the film i probably wouldn’t have been thinking about when it’s supposed to be set,SamT
23012,13/10/2019, 17:52 , so sam if you’re watching a film set now but they show a film from the 1930’s in a scene that would overrule the use of technology in the film and place it’s time period to the film they’re watching?,PaulD
23013,13/10/2019, 17:54 , there’s other factors than the two i pointed out.,SamT

23080,17/10/2019, 12:21 , because he's gone harder brexit - the remain-leaning tories who he kicked out are unlikely to go for it and without them he doesnt have a majy even with the dup,DaveY
23081,17/10/2019, 12:22 , i suppose labour rebels might tip it through,DaveY

23083,17/10/2019, 12:24 , i think boris is probably hoping it fails anyway. plays into his parliament vs people ploy,JackG

23085,17/10/2019, 12:29 , think boris would have to campaign on no deal to get the cunt vote,JackG
23086,17/10/2019, 12:36 , could be great if nigel splits the cunt vote,RobG
23087,17/10/2019, 12:50 , question is if it's rejected does he campaign on no deal or on this deal,DaveY
23088,17/10/2019, 12:53 , yeah that’s a tricky one because if he gets a majy campaigning on this deal you’d assume he’d be able to get it through parliament. he can’t say he’d go no deal if the deal doesn’t pass so no dealers will gravitate towards farage,JackG
23089,17/10/2019, 12:55 , yes campaigning on this deal risks splitting cunt vote again while campaigning on no deal risks pushing moderate tories towards the lib dems,DaveY

23329,22/10/2019, 16:56 , like the world cup for politics,RobG
23330,22/10/2019, 17:10 , the biggest unknown is how the public will react to having brexit delayed. will they punish to pm breaking his promise or will they go with his line that parliament has betrayed the 'will of the people',DamianR
23331,22/10/2019, 17:12 , i bet things come out even more divided that at present,RobG

23377,22/10/2019, 20:10 , a short technical extension would be most sensible for boris. want but he will have to fight mps every step of the way. it would be easier to get a long delay. crush labour and then sail through any brexit he wants with a large majority,DamianR

23858,30/10/2019, 22:37 , yeah that one is a mystery to me. they have done that for a number of our other converts and i have seen some polling that suggests we would win well in a few specific places. i suspect the labour vote in kensington has collapsed and that the pro remain tories will happily vote for one of thier own even if he is actually running for another party.,DamianR
23859,30/10/2019, 22:41 , i'm not sure i can tbh. i think to explain that i would first need to be able to explain how you can  simultaneously be a pro leave daily mail loving gammon and life time labour supporter who voted remain...,DamianR

24346,13/11/2019, 16:12 , well... back fire in that labour are too weak to defend against both us and the tories,DamianR
24347,13/11/2019, 16:13 , if you want to win labour votes you can’t be slagging them off and giving the impression that you’re assisting a tory majority,JackG
24348,13/11/2019, 16:20 , lol yeah,DaveY
24349,13/11/2019, 16:25 , i do think equally labour need to show willingness to stand down in seats they can't win as part of a remain pact - their leadership are so dogmatic that they'll never even consider it,StefanL
24350,13/11/2019, 16:26 , there is no chance. partially i don't think we want to open the door to a mass stand down like the brexit party did as that means less votes overall which means less press coverage and money for the next 5 years,DamianR
24351,13/11/2019, 16:27 , i think they’ve agreed not to campaign in a fair few con/lib marginals haven’t they?,JackG
24352,13/11/2019, 16:27 , agree the awkward fact is that there aren't as many of those as vice versa - your st ives etc.,DaveY
24353,13/11/2019, 16:28 , only a handful where labour is a very clear 3rd,DaveY
24354,13/11/2019, 16:42 , this whole situation could be avoided if we had a proper voting system,JackG
24355,13/11/2019, 16:43 , where did you hear this?,StefanL
24356,13/11/2019, 16:43 , imagine if people had cared as much about the av referendum as the brexit one,RobG
24357,13/11/2019, 16:47 , local labour campaigner so could be fake news,JackG
24358,13/11/2019, 16:56 , which makes it all the more annoying that they won't budge. if labour withdrew 10 of our tory marginals and we from 10 of there's that would be rob 20 seats from the tories and any chance of them getting a majority,DamianR
24359,13/11/2019, 16:56 , *would rob them of 20 seats,DamianR
24360,13/11/2019, 16:57 , >rob,DamianR
24361,13/11/2019, 16:57 , agree,DaveY
24362,13/11/2019, 16:57 , but still reacting to that not happening in this way only has the practical effect of delivering a tory majority,DaveY
24363,13/11/2019, 16:58 , thing is though that gives the tories an easy attack line of “lib dems working with corbyn” and con/lib swingers would run back to tories,JackG
24364,13/11/2019, 16:59 , lol con/lib swingers,DaveY
24365,13/11/2019, 17:00 , this is a concern forsure,DamianR
24366,13/11/2019, 17:05 , personally i think such decisions should be taken at a local level based on local feelings for a local candidate and not reflect the national leadership (which is millstone round the labour parties neck),DamianR
24367,13/11/2019, 17:16 , are there any labour supporters left in the north?,PaulD
24368,13/11/2019, 17:19 , you can still find them,DaveY
24369,13/11/2019, 17:19 , a handful,DaveY
24370,13/11/2019, 17:22 , let's just do away with all parties and mps and instead hold a referendum on every single issue. stop denying the will of the people,RobG

24616,19/11/2019, 14:32 , so i was curious to exactly how much of an effect this would be and to cut a long story short i got her ls of the data from 2017 and determined that in a) there are 7 seats at risk and b) there are 11 seats,DamianR
24617,19/11/2019, 14:34 , based on which assumptions?,DaveY
24618,19/11/2019, 14:43 , firstly i look for constituencies where the total lib dem vote is greater than the difference between labour and tory vote. i dismiss any constituency where lab or con are not trying to win (vote percentage <25%) and any constituency where we are completely uncompetitive as we wouldn't ever bother campaigning (<5%),DamianR
24619,19/11/2019, 14:43 , finally i look at constituencies where the difference between lab/con is less than 15pts,DamianR
24620,19/11/2019, 14:44 , so total 11 constituencies where the lib dems could potentially split the vote pointlessly leading to the tories staying on. not many,DamianR
24621,19/11/2019, 14:45 , tories had a 10 seat majority last time round,HamishS
24622,19/11/2019, 14:45 , but enough to more than replace the loss of the dup as supply partners,RobG
24623,19/11/2019, 14:46 , in this assumption i assumed we would win our high target seats off of the tories so that 11 is not a net gain,DamianR
24624,19/11/2019, 14:48 , but the more people see of swinson the less they like her,HamishS
24625,19/11/2019, 15:09 , and turnout dynamics,DaveY
24626,19/11/2019, 15:19 , agreed. i am looking for somewhere i can get an up to date constituency by constituency dataset and revise this. quite a lot of individual constituency pools show a big swing from labour to the lib dems in some of our target seats but i'm not sure across the country,DamianR
24627,19/11/2019, 15:29 , so no one knows essentially,DaveY

24640,19/11/2019, 19:23 , what makes you think labour and tory are not fighting for every seat? what makes you think this is a normal election? what makes you think this a party election and not a brexit election?,PhilH

25375,27/11/2019, 14:49 , why does emery never unclench his teeth?,DaveY
25376,27/11/2019, 14:53 , why does he play such terrible football?,RobG
25377,27/11/2019, 14:54 , he opens his mouth without opening his teeth,DaveY
25378,27/11/2019, 14:54 , just worked out that's why he looks so odd,DaveY
25379,27/11/2019, 14:55 , good ebening,RobG
25380,27/11/2019, 14:56 , arsenal could really do with poch - but that will never happen?,DaveY
25381,27/11/2019, 14:56 , it's probably unlikely for the rivalry reason,RobG
25382,27/11/2019, 14:57 , would actually ironically fit the club brilliantly,DaveY
25383,27/11/2019, 14:57 , but you'd have said that about sol campbell,RobG
25384,27/11/2019, 14:57 , yeah i think so,RobG
25385,27/11/2019, 14:58 , he's a good defensive coach and good on a second rate budget,RobG
25386,27/11/2019, 15:01 , not sure poch would go there as a respect to spurs thing,DaveY
25387,27/11/2019, 16:26 , MediaShared,RobG
25388,27/11/2019, 16:26 , and we employed him looking to improve,RobG
25389,27/11/2019, 16:31 , that’s pretty poor. not surprising though when he sets up with a back 5 at home against a southampton side in the relegation zone,JackG
25390,27/11/2019, 16:31 , yeah it makes no sense,RobG
25391,27/11/2019, 16:31 , he invites pressure onto a weak defence,RobG
25392,27/11/2019, 16:32 , and leaves quality attacking players isolated,RobG
25393,27/11/2019, 16:32 , plays completely to his squad's weaknesses,RobG
25394,27/11/2019, 16:43 , although he might say you have a shit defence and good forwards so try to bolster the defence and hope the forwards put away the few chances you do create?,DaveY
25395,27/11/2019, 16:44 , the shot difference thing could be a result of trying to keep things tighter knowing you have clinical strikers?,DaveY
25396,27/11/2019, 16:49 , i don't think david luiz was the answer to any of your problems,DaveY
25397,27/11/2019, 16:50 , i think if he's going to play the way he is it's baffling they haven't prioritised full backs/wing backs,DaveY
25398,27/11/2019, 16:51 , a better manager could get far more from this squad.,JackG
25399,27/11/2019, 16:51 , *unlucky,RobG

25402,27/11/2019, 16:54 , havent seen enough of him. it's a big step up from spl to prem will probably take him at least a season to adjust,DaveY
25403,27/11/2019, 17:00 , chambers also looks good when he plays,RobG

26450,12/12/2019, 23:47 , but they said their exit poll is from 20000 people. which divided by 600 constuencys is like 30 per constineuncy,HamishS
26451,12/12/2019, 23:48 , it's a few things. you're asking people right after voting so no undecideds etc. the sample is instantly correct to the turnout without any imputations or assumptions. you don't have to do demographic weighting.,DaveY
26452,12/12/2019, 23:48 , dont understand how they make such an accurate poll per constituency,HamishS
26453,12/12/2019, 23:49 , and you can do it for individual constituencies so don't have to model average swinga,DaveY

26465,12/12/2019, 23:56 , *68. but this was well within margin of error,DaveY
26466,12/12/2019, 23:57 , and average poll lead was 10 points which translates to a big majority.,DaveY
26467,12/12/2019, 23:58 , not necessarily in fptp,PhilH
26468,12/12/2019, 23:58 , either way i'm butthurt but going to revel in the trolling,PhilH
26469,12/12/2019, 23:58 , yes even in fptp. when you get to around 5-7 then it depends on local spreads etc. but no one has ever failed to win a large majority with a +10% vote share,DaveY
26470,13/12/2019, 00:00 , agree it points to a majority but the size of it is still on a largely unknown scale due to said local factors.,PhilH
26471,13/12/2019, 00:01 , there's no arguing that this is an significantly above average majority based on the pre election poll predictions,PhilH
26472,13/12/2019, 00:03 , only vs optimistic readings of the tightest polls. but whatever.,DaveY

26633,18/12/2019, 12:52 , the problem is that there are multiple left leaning parties whereas the vast majority of the right leaning vote is concentrated on one party. without taking some of those i don’t see how labour could get into power,JackG

28233,19/02/2020, 18:11 , i think surely a combination of the two. offside is only ruled when part of body that you can score a goal with is ahead of the final defender. var calls for a review but the review and decision is made by the ref and linesmen on the big screen in the stadium where everyone can see (rather than wasting time by trotting over to a separate monitor and preventing everyone there from seeing why a decision was made).,DamianR

28934,08/03/2020, 09:12 , also hate this idea that adding a healthy food to an unhealthy food somehow makes it less fattening,PhilH
28935,08/03/2020, 09:13 , becca says it all the time with salad. asks if i want salad with dinner. i say no. she says it's good for you. doesn't understand that by not eating the salad i am consuming less calories,PhilH
28936,08/03/2020, 09:14 , good fibre in salad though phil,RobG
28937,08/03/2020, 09:14 , but what if i'm eating a bean chilli and brown rice.,PhilH
28938,08/03/2020, 09:15 , must i also consume an extra 200cals in leaf and oil?,PhilH
28939,08/03/2020, 09:15 , obviously not,RobG
28940,08/03/2020, 09:16 , in theory.,PhilH
28941,08/03/2020, 09:17 , the salad has to itself not be oily/calorific etc and be eatin instead of something worse,RobG
28942,08/03/2020, 09:17 , but more variation is always a plus,RobG
28943,08/03/2020, 09:17 , but in practice it never is. it's always an extra.,PhilH
28944,08/03/2020, 09:18 , i'm still going to eat the same amount of burger regardless of if i have a token salad on the side.,PhilH
28945,08/03/2020, 09:18 , not going to happen. fake news.,PhilH
28946,08/03/2020, 09:19 , but only eating burger and never ever having any vegetables because they would be _more calories_ would just leave your enzymes craving vitamins,RobG
28947,08/03/2020, 09:20 , for the small reward of having cut the least calorific element of the meal,RobG
28948,08/03/2020, 09:20 , just take a multivitamin. next.,PhilH
28949,08/03/2020, 09:20 , fine. but i would enjoy eating a salad more than popping a pill,RobG

28960,08/03/2020, 19:21 , so unecessary. you're ordering a meal of carbs and fat. i assume you'll need a side of carbs and fat to go with that.,DaveY

28962,08/03/2020, 19:22 , imagine it goes somewhere along the midlands,DaveY

28964,08/03/2020, 19:24 , that was actually the main legacy of roman occupation i've heard. the scottish tribes continued to serve bread with their chips as a sign of freedom and resistance,DaveY
28965,08/03/2020, 19:24 , with the chips as well though? like it's an extra not a substitute,DaveY
28966,08/03/2020, 19:25 , that sounds like bollocks to me,DamianR

28972,08/03/2020, 19:29 , so much more vinegar needed than they think you need,RobG
28973,08/03/2020, 19:30 , yeah you can't trust them with vinegar and salt levels they need manual adjustment,DaveY
28974,08/03/2020, 19:30 , pints of vinegar rob,DaveY
28975,08/03/2020, 19:30 , i could dip chips into a pint of it,RobG
28976,08/03/2020, 19:30 , a good serving suggestion,RobG
28977,08/03/2020, 19:31 , the type of vinegar also crucial,DaveY
28978,08/03/2020, 19:31 , need to be that darker chip shop vinegar not generic malt,DaveY
28979,08/03/2020, 19:31 , yeah. has to be 100% opaque,RobG
28980,08/03/2020, 19:32 , for the sort of chips that come in styrofoam,DaveY

28991,09/03/2020, 13:57 , how can the government claim that we’re still in a containment phase with coronavirus while simultaneously accepting it will spread in a significant way. negligent,JackG

28999,09/03/2020, 14:10 , is the coronavirus more deadly than they first thought?,PaulD
29000,09/03/2020, 14:12 , i think it’s still quite uncertain. a lot of unreported cases where people were fine skewing it. still not ideal though and apparently reinfection is a thing,JackG
29001,09/03/2020, 14:30 , it probably wouldn't move as quickly - really deadly things are obvious and get contained quickly. they also limit their own transmission by killing their hosts before they spread it too far,RobG
29002,09/03/2020, 14:30 , apparently they have considered just getting it over and done with and letting it spread thought wh population quickly,HamishS
29003,09/03/2020, 14:31 , but think they predicted 500k deatha,HamishS
29004,09/03/2020, 14:31 , the current plans are based on trying to contain it until summer,HamishS
29005,09/03/2020, 14:39 , yeah the issue with letting it spread quickly is you get a massive peak of cases which overwhelms the health system,StefanL
29006,09/03/2020, 14:39 , not enough intensive care beds,HamishS
29007,09/03/2020, 14:40 , also there have been quite a few cases of reinfection so it’s not even getting the problem out of the way,JackG

29105,11/03/2020, 18:49 , has overwhelmed their hospitals,HamishS
29106,11/03/2020, 18:52 , unless they are very shit at testing,DaveY
29107,11/03/2020, 18:53 , so it skews results. we are 6 dead from 450. much lower as a % of cases,DaveY
29108,11/03/2020, 18:53 , MediaShared,PaulD

29113,11/03/2020, 18:55 , but why mild cases undetected if they're 2nd highest test rate globally?,DaveY
29114,11/03/2020, 18:55 , the milder cases undetected is pretty key,HamishS
29115,11/03/2020, 18:58 , probably because the real number of infections per head is so much higher than other countries with high testing rates. so more are missed,StefanL
29116,11/03/2020, 18:59 , probably get lots of people who have it just staying in and not engaging with health care at all,RobG
29117,11/03/2020, 19:08 , so really does point to acting soon and smoothing peak out. can't let it get away from you,DaveY

29946,16/03/2020, 16:27 , but isn’t a little mutation just standard? inevitable when it comes up against an organism with immunity. otherwise we’d never get colds again,JackG
29947,16/03/2020, 16:28 , and possibly render our vaccines and antivirals useless,RobG
29948,16/03/2020, 16:28 , well colds and flu are seasonal because they mutate a lot,RobG

30390,17/03/2020, 18:15 , not if i lose my job because my company doesn't have cash to pay people,PhilH
30391,17/03/2020, 18:16 , this sounds pretty much like my experience,JamesB
30392,17/03/2020, 18:17 , https://finance.yahoo.com/news/its-time-for-free-money-from-washington-190321406.html,PaulD
30393,17/03/2020, 18:18 , lol they obviously wo t give it to 5 year olds. how many 5 year olds have an ni number and bank account?,DaveY
30395,17/03/2020, 18:19 , plus yeah you still get your salary. a supplement not a replacement otherwise that would be a pay cut for most people,DaveY
30396,17/03/2020, 18:20 , my point is people have different financial needs. take two people who lose their jobs because their companies have no cash flow. one has monthly outgoings of £1k the other lives in kent and has a £2k mortgage.,PhilH
30397,17/03/2020, 18:20 , the point of this measure would be to catch people not on standard pay rolls like james.,DaveY
30398,17/03/2020, 18:20 , too difficult to identify the needy - just give to everyone,PaulD
30399,17/03/2020, 18:20 , there are additional measures to support business cash flow,DaveY
30400,17/03/2020, 18:20 , like what.,PhilH
30401,17/03/2020, 18:21 , all the loans and tax relief they just announced?,DaveY
30402,17/03/2020, 18:21 , so is this 1k for all actually happening or is it fake news?,JackG
30403,17/03/2020, 18:21 , fake but just a hypothesis,PaulD
30404,17/03/2020, 18:21 , not enough in reality. tax relief does not equal liquidity.,PhilH
30405,17/03/2020, 18:23 , i love how seriously we're debating paul invented measure,RobG
30406,17/03/2020, 18:23 , this. i'm in a different industry but cash flow is vital in my sector too,JamesB
30407,17/03/2020, 18:24 , but there are also grants and loans,DaveY
30408,17/03/2020, 18:24 , 10k - 25k,PhilH
30409,17/03/2020, 18:24 , enough for a week,PhilH
30410,17/03/2020, 18:25 , £5m loans for sme companies with no interest for at least 6months,PaulD
30411,17/03/2020, 18:25 , yeah lol. very much not 25k,DaveY
30412,17/03/2020, 18:26 , still crippling though. needs to be grants if you want companies to survive,JamesB

30415,17/03/2020, 18:26 , MediaShared,PhilH
30416,17/03/2020, 18:26 , it makes no sense. i agree with a phil it’s a pointless solution that most people will just spend on rubbish. need to pump money into the system to keep businesses paying staff and out severe penalties in place for any bollocks where businesses are avoiding paying staff etc,JackG
30417,17/03/2020, 18:27 , a £5m loan is bollocks as it will cripple low margin industries for years,PhilH
30418,17/03/2020, 18:27 , they are doing that as well jack.,DaveY
30419,17/03/2020, 18:28 , also why do you assume people would spend a 1000k grant on rubbish bit not their wage packet?,DaveY
30420,17/03/2020, 18:28 , https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51932403,PaulD
30421,17/03/2020, 18:28 , 5 minutes ago!,PaulD
30422,17/03/2020, 18:28 , >cheques,JackG
30423,17/03/2020, 18:28 , because i know most of my staff in london run out of money every month because they spend it on coke?,PhilH
30424,17/03/2020, 18:29 , so pay them less wages. they're just spending it on rubbish.,DaveY
30425,17/03/2020, 18:29 , unecessary,DaveY
30426,17/03/2020, 18:29 , but give them a grand. ok karl.,PhilH
30427,17/03/2020, 18:30 , lol the illogic. can't reason with that,DaveY
30428,17/03/2020, 18:30 , >tracking people’s spend and giving the a pay cut because they spend money on anything leisurely,JackG
30429,17/03/2020, 18:31 , jack are you on both sides of the argument?!,PaulD
30430,17/03/2020, 18:32 , no i’m just pointing out how ridiculous it is to pay people less money based on what they spend it on,JackG
30431,17/03/2020, 18:32 , lol but you are using that exact logic to oppose the 1k,DaveY
30432,17/03/2020, 18:32 , but that was your entire point against the £1k,PaulD
30433,17/03/2020, 18:33 , no i’m against the £1k because people will spend it on crap. but you’re saying if that’s the case then they shouldn’t be paid that money in the first place. very draconian,JackG
30434,17/03/2020, 18:35 , no i'm pointing out there is no difference between 1k in wage support or 1k in grant in terms of the demand it generates and the liquidity it creates,DaveY
30435,17/03/2020, 18:36 , wages = spend on coke (supported by grant) - £1k from government = spend it on coke,PaulD
30436,17/03/2020, 18:37 , peoples behaviour will be the same,PaulD
30437,17/03/2020, 18:37 , a 1k grant to individuals creates no liquidity for businesses.,PhilH
30438,17/03/2020, 18:37 , nor does tax relief,PhilH
30439,17/03/2020, 18:38 , nor does a huge loan at an unspecified interest rate after 6 months foster any sort of sustainability,PhilH
30440,17/03/2020, 18:38 , if you witheld cash now it would be much worse,PaulD
30441,17/03/2020, 18:38 , the second 2 do exactly that. the first does so indirectly,DaveY
30442,17/03/2020, 18:39 , how does tax relief create cash?,PhilH
30443,17/03/2020, 18:39 , it just means you pay less cash.,PhilH
30444,17/03/2020, 18:39 , you're not given cash.,PhilH
30445,17/03/2020, 18:39 , it's cash that is not leaving your bank account.,DaveY
30446,17/03/2020, 18:39 , keeps cash on the balance sheet,PaulD
30447,17/03/2020, 18:39 , hence you have more cash,DaveY
30448,17/03/2020, 18:39 , lol so deluded.,PhilH
30449,17/03/2020, 18:39 , lol,DaveY
30450,17/03/2020, 18:39 , so many companies have cashflow issues at the moment,PhilH
30451,17/03/2020, 18:39 , MediaShared,HamishS
30452,17/03/2020, 18:40 , so phil somebody says you dont have to pay any bills or mortgage this months. that leaves with no more cash at the end of the month?,DaveY
30453,17/03/2020, 18:41 , hence the loans and grants. you seem unable to grasp that there are multiple different measures to do different things.,DaveY
30454,17/03/2020, 18:41 , i would rather not take anything than take a loan,JamesB
30455,17/03/2020, 18:42 , you seem to live in some sort of fantasy land,PhilH
30456,17/03/2020, 18:42 , i'd just have to take some other work instead,JamesB
30457,17/03/2020, 18:42 , loan would be too destructive,JamesB

30467,17/03/2020, 20:05 , but yeah i mean it's a shit show companies will go bust. a few companies going busy would not be a bad thing as they are likely the shitest run and others will mop up their market share and expand.,DaveY

30500,17/03/2020, 20:41 , dat initial peak,PaulD
30501,17/03/2020, 20:43 , and that's assuming infection does confer long lasting immunity,StefanL
30502,17/03/2020, 20:44 , why does it take so long to get a fucking vaccine?,PhilH
30503,17/03/2020, 20:44 , surely we can just print vaccines now we can sequester dna?,PhilH
30504,17/03/2020, 20:46 , increase nhs alongside though so shortens the time,PaulD
30505,17/03/2020, 20:46 , safety and efficacy trials mostly,RobG
30506,17/03/2020, 20:47 , a lot of that can be sped up surely,RobG
30507,17/03/2020, 20:49 , they already started human trials yesterday,PaulD
30508,17/03/2020, 20:49 , but vaccines are in principle relatively simple compared to a drug,RobG
30509,17/03/2020, 20:49 , skipped all those stages,PaulD
30510,17/03/2020, 20:49 , also probably the worst outcome is you give someone corona,RobG
30511,17/03/2020, 20:50 , would be good if they stumble on a great vaccine really quickly but comes with terrible side effects.,DaveY
30512,17/03/2020, 20:50 , it also acts as an intense and instant laxative,DaveY
30513,17/03/2020, 20:50 , that’s coffee,PaulD
30514,17/03/2020, 20:50 , already exists,PaulD
30515,17/03/2020, 20:51 , but coffee doesn't vaccinate against covid-19 as far as i'm aware,DaveY
30516,17/03/2020, 20:51 , if it does i'm fine,DaveY
30517,17/03/2020, 20:51 , has to be given on the toilet,HamishS
30518,17/03/2020, 20:51 , perhaps the delivery mechanism,HamishS
30519,17/03/2020, 20:52 , covid free or long term laxative. that’s your options,PaulD
30520,17/03/2020, 20:52 , 'they accidentally isolated the shit protein',RobG
30521,17/03/2020, 20:52 , ruins your guts for a year,PaulD
30522,17/03/2020, 20:52 , forced to isolate anyway due to explosive shitting,PaulD
30523,17/03/2020, 20:52 , has complex higher level emergent effects that no one could model. but makes you shit yourself,DaveY
30524,17/03/2020, 20:54 , yeah so we get herd immunity but accompanied by herd incontinence,DaveY
30525,17/03/2020, 20:54 , our ward today ran out of masks,HamishS
30526,17/03/2020, 20:54 , fuck,RobG
30527,17/03/2020, 20:54 , the bog roll now seems petty,HamishS
30528,17/03/2020, 20:54 , ah. you'd think masks would be a minimum,DaveY
30529,17/03/2020, 20:54 , the rules in the hospital change daily but normally because of supply issues rather than evidence based practice,HamishS
30530,17/03/2020, 20:54 , lol the herd incontinence,PaulD
30531,17/03/2020, 20:55 , are you seeing a lot more admissions to icu?,PaulD
30532,17/03/2020, 20:55 , yesterday we had 56 people with suspected covid,HamishS
30533,17/03/2020, 20:55 , today 90,HamishS
30534,17/03/2020, 20:56 , all pneumonia?,PaulD
30535,17/03/2020, 20:56 , yeah,HamishS
30536,17/03/2020, 20:56 , lots of negative tests aswell though,HamishS
30537,17/03/2020, 20:56 , ah,PaulD
30538,17/03/2020, 20:56 , so regular seasonal stuff intermingled,PaulD
30539,17/03/2020, 20:57 , are you testing everyone with pneumonia symtoms? and what's the turnaround time?,StefanL
30540,17/03/2020, 20:57 , could catch covid in the meantime,PaulD
30541,17/03/2020, 20:57 , turn around for testing was up to a week last week,HamishS
30542,17/03/2020, 20:57 , are there enough tests even?,DaveY
30543,17/03/2020, 20:57 , a double hit,PaulD
30544,17/03/2020, 20:57 , which is why they stopped testing i the community,HamishS
30545,17/03/2020, 20:57 , have flu already then catch covid,PaulD
30546,17/03/2020, 20:58 , sp now you only get tested if you need admission,HamishS
30547,17/03/2020, 20:58 , by which time you could be symptomless or dead i suppose,JamesB
30548,17/03/2020, 20:58 , what's the demographic spread that you see in the hospitals with it?,DaveY
30549,17/03/2020, 20:58 , if you go to a&e with the symptoms but dont need admitting then you are told to self isolate but not tested,HamishS
30550,17/03/2020, 20:58 , all older?,DaveY
30551,17/03/2020, 20:58 , we havnt seen alot of positive yet so hard to judge,HamishS
30552,17/03/2020, 21:02 , are you having to work much longer shifts?,RobG
30553,17/03/2020, 21:03 , not yet,HamishS
30554,17/03/2020, 21:04 , but they anticipate that 50% of the work force will have to isolate in the next 4 weeks,HamishS
30555,17/03/2020, 21:04 , so that will likely change,HamishS
30556,17/03/2020, 21:05 , the working from home and social distancing will surely have a positive effect,RobG
30557,17/03/2020, 21:06 , yeah massive,PaulD
30558,17/03/2020, 21:06 , problem is the relatively long incubation though?,JamesB
30559,17/03/2020, 21:06 , people already infected waiting for it to burst out of the chest,JamesB
30560,17/03/2020, 21:06 , lol,PaulD
30561,17/03/2020, 21:07 , that’s why they’ll do a mandatory quarantine,PaulD
30562,17/03/2020, 21:07 , i feel better now than i have done in a week and a half,PaulD
30563,17/03/2020, 21:07 , like the grot is ebbing away,PaulD
30564,17/03/2020, 21:08 , the persistent cold disappearing,PaulD

30566,17/03/2020, 21:08 , even that's pretty good now,JamesB
30567,17/03/2020, 21:08 , the grot skin has been shed,JamesB
30568,17/03/2020, 21:08 , need that test to see if you’ve already had covid,PaulD
30569,17/03/2020, 21:10 ," at present the biggest obstruction to fflow through the hospital is people awaiting results for ""suspected"" covid",HamishS
30570,17/03/2020, 21:11 , so the priority is to spend up in hospital testing to move people along,HamishS
30571,17/03/2020, 21:11 , could they be told to go home and act as if they are infected until they get results,JamesB
30572,17/03/2020, 21:11 , or are we talking people in need of immediate care,JamesB
30573,17/03/2020, 21:12 , only people unwell enough to need admission are tested,HamishS

30799,18/03/2020, 16:54 , will start to think about it when there is half a roll left on the reel,DaveY
30800,18/03/2020, 16:55 , literal squeaky bum time,JackG
30801,18/03/2020, 16:56 , that's still 5 shits or so. couple of days. so i'll just start to bear it in mind at that point.,DaveY
30802,18/03/2020, 16:58 , 31 rolls is complete madness. you've lost your senses,DaveY
30803,18/03/2020, 16:59 , don’t forget dave that all your shit are happening at home now... work toilet can’t take the brunt off your shit for you now.,SamT
30804,18/03/2020, 16:59 , i also think the coffee shits is fake news,JamesB
30805,18/03/2020, 16:59 , i'm on my fourth mug now and yet to shit,JamesB
30806,18/03/2020, 17:00 , yeah but i maybe shit twice a day. now one of those is at home rather than work.,DaveY
30807,18/03/2020, 17:00 , what kind of coffee?,DaveY
30808,18/03/2020, 17:00 , 3x fresh cafetiere mugs and 1x instant,JamesB
30809,18/03/2020, 17:00 , doubled the demand you were previously placing on your rolls,SamT
30810,18/03/2020, 17:01 , true but doubling from a very low base,DaveY
30811,18/03/2020, 17:01 , i'm not overly concerned,DaveY
30812,18/03/2020, 17:01 , what's fay's consumption like?,RobG
30813,18/03/2020, 17:02 , you’re way too confident here dave,JackG
30814,18/03/2020, 17:02 , don't feel the need to get a years supply in,DaveY
30815,18/03/2020, 17:02 , hoping this rumor of shutting down london is just a rumour. i won't last 3 months with such dire loo roll supplies,DamianR
30816,18/03/2020, 17:02 , i can't get over how much more women use,RobG
30817,18/03/2020, 17:02 , jack you're part of the problem.,DaveY
30818,18/03/2020, 17:03 , not really. i bought one pack of 24. regular (apparently) people like you wouldn’t go anywhere near that so you’re not missing anything,JackG
30819,18/03/2020, 17:03 , haven't noticed it - to be fair she often buys the loo roll that's partly where this complacency stems from. i just assume theres always bog roll there.,DaveY
30820,18/03/2020, 17:03 , but you already had 7 rolls when you bought it,RobG
30821,18/03/2020, 17:04 , and who’s laughing now?,JackG
30822,18/03/2020, 17:04 , my feeling is this is an artificial temporary problem caused by people needlessly clearing out the stock currently on the shelves. everyone will now have loads so as it is restocked demand will be less. that's when i enter the market,DaveY
30823,18/03/2020, 17:05 , there will likely be an oversupply crisis as they adjust to higher demand but everyone is in fact shitting at just the same rate as always. i can clean up on the lower prices that may bring.,DaveY
30824,18/03/2020, 17:06 , who's laughing then jack? as you work through your 31 rolls bought at the peak of the bubble,DaveY
30825,18/03/2020, 17:08 , i think i’ll be alright. an extra £1 now is worth having no stress about whether i can afford to shit or not,JackG

30855,18/03/2020, 17:38 , no exams means no a-levels means no university enrolments?,JamesB
30856,18/03/2020, 17:38 , yeah that's potentially fucked up everything,DaveY
30857,18/03/2020, 17:39 , just write off this year,PaulD

30900,18/03/2020, 18:09 , so teachers still have to work just to look after key worker children? how's that going to work?,DaveY
30901,18/03/2020, 18:11 , reckon that is probably a very good idea,HamishS
30902,18/03/2020, 18:11 , i think all key workers children will be in school doing remote learning,HamishS
30903,18/03/2020, 18:11 , but the child care is key,HamishS
30904,18/03/2020, 18:12 , yeah agree they need to go somewhere. but weird to make secondary school teachers cover that,DaveY
30905,18/03/2020, 18:12 , they're not exactly going to be doing anything else,PhilH
30906,18/03/2020, 18:14 , also ironically they will be getting taught content while no one else is - puts them at an unfair advantage?,DaveY
30907,18/03/2020, 18:15 , unless its like end of term days at chippy where they stick blackadder on and pretend it teaches us about ww1,DaveY
30908,18/03/2020, 18:16 , it’s an unprecedented situation. no one has ideal solutions and honestly there probably aren’t any,JackG
30909,18/03/2020, 18:16 , one solution is to always buy your normal everyday 24 pack of bog roll though,PaulD
30910,18/03/2020, 18:16 , 👍,JackG
30911,18/03/2020, 18:18 , i dont think they will have classes,HamishS
30912,18/03/2020, 18:18 , they will have remote learning/online learning,HamishS
30913,18/03/2020, 18:18 , so will all essentially be babysat at school,HamishS
30914,18/03/2020, 18:18 , so going school to be taught by teachers who are at home?,DaveY

30926,18/03/2020, 18:22 , should have done better at as level dave. next,JackG
30927,18/03/2020, 18:23 , very ropey. harriet pointed out there will be a number of students already accepted but deferred start ie gap yahh,JamesB
30928,18/03/2020, 18:23 , would be ridiculous. especially as they sometimes deflate predicted grades to impact their metrics on how many student over-perform predictions. so an incentive to under-predict,DaveY
30929,18/03/2020, 18:24 , can't let students attend (and take on the financial responsibilities) to have them take exams in autumn and fail,JamesB
30930,18/03/2020, 18:24 , january start? most universities already do a september and january intake?,JamesB

31230,19/03/2020, 18:11 , i'm pretty sure i say here that i don't have evidence of jack's hording so he's probably right on that one,DamianR

31238,19/03/2020, 18:28 , student*,JackG
31239,19/03/2020, 18:30 , important to root out the hoarders among us and then test them to see if they are hoarders any more or if they have repented,JamesB
31240,19/03/2020, 18:31 , bog roll restocked now anyway. so you're sitting on 31 rolls for no reason,DaveY
31241,19/03/2020, 18:31 , yeah because i’m not planning on ever taking a shit again,JackG
31242,19/03/2020, 18:32 , you panicked,DaveY

31244,19/03/2020, 18:33 , this is largely the assumption i was operating under. i would have loved to have thrown jack under a bus by providing photos of him clutching at bog roll as it falls from inside his room.... but alas i am unable to (because it didn't happen),DamianR
31245,19/03/2020, 18:37 , how many rolls have you used since you stocked up?,DaveY

31253,19/03/2020, 18:46 , because jack has it all,PaulD
31254,19/03/2020, 18:46 , hence hoarders,PaulD

31616,21/03/2020, 08:57 , i think the do nothing model had 500k deaths but i highly doubt that number is purely coronavirus deaths. @447526575752 of the cases you see. what percentage of victims have serious health conditions that may have resulted in them dying within the year any way?,DamianR
31617,21/03/2020, 09:00 , i think alot of non corona virus deaths will be accelerated. we are stopping giving most people chemotherapy for non curable conditions so you would expect cancer survival statistics to be much higher in the next 6months,HamishS
31618,21/03/2020, 09:19 , yeah i guess the problem is that all those yearly deaths are coming at the same time rather than spread throughout the year.,DamianR

31621,21/03/2020, 09:39 , i'm not sure the biggest concern about coronavirus is necessarily the mortality rate of the virus itself. we are already resigned to the fact that 80% will get it,HamishS
31622,21/03/2020, 09:40 , the biggest concern is is overwhelms health  systems and then the mortality rate of coronavirus and other conditions will rise exponentially,HamishS
31623,21/03/2020, 09:41 , your chance of surviving a major car accident for example is much lower if all the operating theatres are full of covid patients on ventilators and the surgeon is at home i'll with symptoms,HamishS
31624,21/03/2020, 09:43 , also current mortality rate of inpatient covid admissions over 70years of age is 100% (albeit small numbers at this time),HamishS

31626,21/03/2020, 09:46 , people probably drinking a lot more booze. hence liver problems down the line,DaveY
31627,21/03/2020, 09:55 , who has tested positive with covid. small numbers n<20 from frimley park,HamishS

31631,21/03/2020, 10:29 , right. yeah,DaveY

31659,21/03/2020, 11:24 , how quickly can you get tested now?,DaveY
31660,21/03/2020, 11:24 , as all virus have an incubation period,HamishS
31661,21/03/2020, 11:25 , i wont be able to get tested unless i need hospital admission,HamishS
31662,21/03/2020, 11:25 , ah.,DaveY
31663,21/03/2020, 11:25 , but trusts are arguing with the government that we need to,HamishS
31664,21/03/2020, 11:25 , so you have to develop symptoms to be isolated now,DaveY
31665,21/03/2020, 11:25 , yeah this seems like a not great situation.,DaveY
31666,21/03/2020, 11:26 , it will be going around the nhs quickly with people who haven't been tested and currently asymptomatic,DaveY
31667,21/03/2020, 11:26 , i suppose if the nhs can develop its own mini herd immunity before the rest of the country that could be okay?,DaveY

32062,23/03/2020, 20:56 , interests rates already at 0.1%. already maxed out the levers for improving the economy. going to be soo much borrowing that's really going to really drive up inflation,DamianR

32072,23/03/2020, 21:06 , also the interest payments on additional government debt are going to be tiny at the moment as interest rates are virtually zero. and you are unlikely to get punished with capital outflow because all other countries are doing exactly the same thing so there is nowhere else for capital to go. so it's pretty much risk free.,DaveY
32073,23/03/2020, 21:07 , this is as close to the exact situation keynesian economics models as you can get.,DaveY
