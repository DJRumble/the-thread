02/08/2018, 16:56 - Sam;: Free transfer
02/08/2018, 16:57 - Paul Dickinson: Oh so just load him up with wages
02/08/2018, 16:57 - Rob;: 70K a week for Eriksen would have been affordable a decade ago though
02/08/2018, 16:58 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
02/08/2018, 17:06 - / James Ball: First time I've ever built a wall, felt I should share. You can resume talking about football now.
02/08/2018, 17:07 - Paul Dickinson: How big is the wall going to be? Don’t stop there
02/08/2018, 17:08 - Rob;: Will it keep the Mexicans out?
02/08/2018, 17:08 - Rob;: Do you think the guest bedroom might be a bit pokey?
02/08/2018, 17:14 - Sam;: The most intense froust chamber ever built?
02/08/2018, 17:14 - Paul Dickinson: You eventually seal yourself in
02/08/2018, 17:21 - Damian Rumble: Whose paying for it?
02/08/2018, 17:43 - / James Ball: Who's Damian, who's.

02/08/2018, 17:59 - / James Ball: All too late for this year, just being prepared ready for next season

03/08/2018, 00:50 - Damian Rumble: Got a gas well burning out of control? Obviously the best solution is to nuke it
03/08/2018, 01:13 - Paul Dickinson: Fekin werked tho din it

03/08/2018, 10:06 - Hamish Sinclair: My arse is in tatters
03/08/2018, 10:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Had a vegan curry last night and I'm dealing with hot, gassy slurry
03/08/2018, 10:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Meat wouldn't do this to you
03/08/2018, 10:08 - Phill: >vegan
03/08/2018, 10:08 - Phill: >Trusting that witchcraft to not violate your colon
03/08/2018, 10:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Chickpea, sweet corn and lentil. The warning signs were there
03/08/2018, 10:20 - Rob;: I found out if you don't wash tinned pulses properly you get loads more fibre than you need because the water they're in contains savagely indigestible compounds
03/08/2018, 10:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Sounds like a great randomised control trial in the making
03/08/2018, 10:21 - Rob;: Like 400% of your recommended daily amount of fibre
03/08/2018, 10:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Feed Sam two Currys on two separate days
03/08/2018, 10:22 - Rob;: With a constant amount of MDMA
03/08/2018, 10:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Just waiting to break through
03/08/2018, 11:07 - David;: Lol so mdma is the dependent variable?
03/08/2018, 11:08 - Phill: Wish I'd recorded the elsan bit
03/08/2018, 11:08 - Phill: Stand up. I can't. Try. 💩
03/08/2018, 11:10 - Damian Rumble: Tbh that actually sounds pretty tasty...
03/08/2018, 11:11 - Phill: Remember going for a shit the day after and seeing Sam's pat on top basically covering the whole area of the circle
03/08/2018, 11:11 - Phill: Looked like Bolognese.
03/08/2018, 11:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh, would have been the best scene in the blame y cwm sitcom
03/08/2018, 11:20 - Rob;: It was nice that we were all there to support him
03/08/2018, 11:21 - Rob;: I would also like footage of Stefan and I discussing that we are each other's oldest friend while explosively emptying our arses and grunting in turn
03/08/2018, 11:25 - Stefan;: That was a beautiful moment
03/08/2018, 11:27 - Stefan;: The pauses halfway through fond reminiscences as I crank another turd out
03/08/2018, 11:30 - Sam;: Hammering the turd crank
03/08/2018, 12:33 - Sam;: The Oreo ice cream range is outstanding
03/08/2018, 12:42 - Paul Dickinson: What they offering?
03/08/2018, 12:43 - Sam;: The Oreo sandwich. The magnum like offering on a stick. Fantastic
03/08/2018, 12:44 - Sam;: The classic ice cream tub
03/08/2018, 12:45 - Phill: >mass produced ice cream. Scum.
03/08/2018, 12:47 - David;: But Sam we know how your bowels react to ice cream. Can you handle the fallout?
03/08/2018, 12:47 - David;: Is it worth it?
03/08/2018, 12:48 - Sam;: Mass produced because it’s so good that every fucker wants it.

Just piled a thick milkshake on top of it. A few beers later and there’s going to be quite a show tonight
03/08/2018, 12:49 - Phill: Say hi to Dan and Karen for me
03/08/2018, 12:51 - Sam;: Nah they’ll just say they ‘don’t want a hello from that uppity prick’
03/08/2018, 12:53 - David;: Salt of the earth
03/08/2018, 12:54 - David;: Rags to riches
03/08/2018, 12:54 - Sam;: A bloody bloke is Dan
03/08/2018, 12:55 - Sam;: And Karen
03/08/2018, 13:01 - David;: Did you see ed balls' doccy about trumpland?
03/08/2018, 13:01 - Sam;: Gonna need to. What channel?
03/08/2018, 13:01 - David;: Bbc gumpplayer
03/08/2018, 13:03 - David;: Its good he gets into the real redneck grot. And hes there as a slightly posh english bloke, but embraces it
03/08/2018, 13:03 - David;: They get him in an old school wrestling costume and he has to act as the evil foreigner that they all hate
03/08/2018, 13:06 - Stefan;: Sounds excellent
03/08/2018, 13:06 - Stefan;: Do they straight up admit that they're racist and hate blacks/Muslims, like on Baron-Cohen's show?
03/08/2018, 13:07 - David;: Nah they sort of take the 'we're not racist just normal blokes, proud of the flag, misunderstood by the cosmopolitans'
03/08/2018, 13:07 - David;: He digs up a black and mexican trump supporter.
03/08/2018, 13:08 - David;: So much cognitive dissonance
03/08/2018, 13:09 - David;: She's like 'yeah well he just doesnt like criminals. I'm not a criminal. I wouldnt want a rapist coming here anyway'
03/08/2018, 13:21 - Stefan;: Classic
03/08/2018, 13:21 - Stefan;: Nobody can argue with that
03/08/2018, 13:26 - David;: Balls somehow managing to appear a lot more human and normal than when he was seeking elected office
03/08/2018, 14:06 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
03/08/2018, 14:08 - Sam;: I recognise the extraction system. World class gas removal technology
03/08/2018, 15:11 - Sam;: Dave, is this what it felt like when my gas woke you up in the flat?

Too hot? In 1858 a heatwave turned London into a stinking sewer
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-45009749
03/08/2018, 15:12 - Paul Dickinson: What caused you to create gas like that?
03/08/2018, 15:13 - Sam;: It happened in an era marred by poor documentation so the causes are unknown
03/08/2018, 15:13 - Paul Dickinson: Not the Thornton mush?
03/08/2018, 15:14 - Sam;: Nah, that was benign, rice peas and tuna
03/08/2018, 17:16 - David;: I remember, it was nandos and then ice cream. The toxic mix
03/08/2018, 17:17 - David;: You had work nandos on friday then lager then ice cream. The perfect storm, your colon never stood a chance
03/08/2018, 17:18 - David;: Through 2 closed doors and an intervening room, but my survival instinct kicked in with the oxygen levels falling.
03/08/2018, 17:20 - Rob;: Breakfast at My Brother's Cologne
03/08/2018, 17:22 - Sam;: Ah yes. The spices from the chicken, the creamy dairy, the gaseous lager. A tinder box if ever there was one. 

So booze, spiced fast food and ice cream is what it takes to reach peak gas in both volume and stench
03/08/2018, 17:23 - David;: We need to start obsessively documenting which foods and conditions lead to which types of gas, then repeating experiments
03/08/2018, 17:23 - David;: There should be a website with this sort of data crowd-sourced
03/08/2018, 17:24 - Sam;: Yeah yeah yeah. And how to create the slurryest of slurrys
03/08/2018, 17:25 - David;: Yeah, like i've worked out a chilli con carne eaten on the come up of 2/3rds of an acid tab gives limitless volumes of odourless gas.
03/08/2018, 17:27 - Rob;: Shartipedia
03/08/2018, 17:31 - David;: Surely wikishart?
03/08/2018, 17:36 - Rob;: Or just Wikileaks?
03/08/2018, 17:46 - Phill: Gasitleaks
03/08/2018, 18:01 - David;: Wikipoodia
03/08/2018, 18:08 - Jack G;: On the Origin of Faeces

03/08/2018, 18:11 - David;: 50 shades of gut spray
03/08/2018, 18:12 - Sam;: Visceral Dave
03/08/2018, 18:12 - Sam;: Very visceral
03/08/2018, 18:12 - Sam;: >gut spray
03/08/2018, 23:13 - Paul Dickinson: What was that four tet remix song?

05/08/2018, 18:37 - Rob;: Who will start in defence for liverpool?
05/08/2018, 18:37 - Phill: Van dijk, Trent, Robertson and probably gomez/lovren filling the other spot
05/08/2018, 18:38 - Rob;: The either/or was not what I wanted to hear
05/08/2018, 18:49 - Phill: Can't help you with that final spot in afraid
05/08/2018, 19:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Also wouldn't be surprised to see clyne play RB for the first few games

06/08/2018, 08:28 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/efcash25/status/1026125962478538753?s=19
06/08/2018, 10:36 - David;: I'm pretty sure it will be Robertson, Virgil, Gomez, Clyne for the first game, based on preseason
06/08/2018, 10:37 - David;: Then lovren and trent coming in for gomez ajd clyne in a week or 2
06/08/2018, 10:37 - David;: Forst choice is def Robertson, Virgil, Lovren, Trent but lovren and trent both went far in the world cup
06/08/2018, 10:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Salah and mane are both midfielders?? This is mebtal
06/08/2018, 10:58 - Rob;: Ah so the two most likely starters cost 6 instead of 5. Breaks team. I won't be investing.
06/08/2018, 10:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Are we doing a draft?
06/08/2018, 11:02 - Rob;: Can we find a free evening? I basically have tonight or Wednesday only - flying to Edinburgh Thursday night
06/08/2018, 11:32 - Phill: Tonight? 8pm?

06/08/2018, 16:07 - Damian Rumble: I'm out of draft. Will be flying to Croatia then. Not expecting to have much internet at that...
06/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: Possibly might be able to
06/08/2018, 17:32 - David;: Should be if it doesnt take too long. Sambo - a draft team?
06/08/2018, 17:33 - Sam;: Wa ya mean when ya say draft team?
06/08/2018, 17:33 - Sam;: Like the NFL?

06/08/2018, 17:36 - Damian Rumble: Gateway game
06/08/2018, 17:38 - Sam;: Looking back in the thread the 8pm ting does no work for me. I’ve retired from football management. I only work in an advisory capacity now
06/08/2018, 17:38 - Sam;: 60 seasons at spurs on FM09 was enough
06/08/2018, 17:39 - David;: Was it actually 60? How old was your character?
06/08/2018, 17:39 - Sam;: I was in my 80’s
06/08/2018, 17:40 - David;: Also hom many titles in that period?
06/08/2018, 17:40 - Sam;: Well we’re talking 50
06/08/2018, 17:41 - Sam;: I couldn’t stop
06/08/2018, 17:54 - David;: Did they force you to retire?
06/08/2018, 17:54 - Paul Dickinson: Does your character ever die? Did you yourself develop Alzheimer’s or anything via proxy and start making ill informed decisions
06/08/2018, 17:55 - Paul Dickinson: At the very least I imagine you had a colostomy bag
06/08/2018, 18:10 - Phill: Shall we do Wednesday instead?
06/08/2018, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh i can do either
06/08/2018, 18:11 - David;: Yeah wednesday
06/08/2018, 18:11 - David;: I'll be in France gumping

06/08/2018, 18:15 - Phill: 🤢
06/08/2018, 18:15 - David;: Presume it will be bourdeaux- like
06/08/2018, 18:15 - David;: Cabs etc.
06/08/2018, 18:15 - Phill: You driving?
06/08/2018, 18:17 - David;: Nah, plane. Parents booked this place and are  there for 2 weeks, we're just going for a week. Picking us up from airport. Pretty good, free villa for a week.
06/08/2018, 18:17 - David;: Will need to work in between gumping. Work and gump. Like game and watch
06/08/2018, 18:17 - Phill: French gump will consume you
06/08/2018, 18:18 - Phill: No such thing as le petit gump
06/08/2018, 18:18 - Phill: Grande gump every day
06/08/2018, 18:18 - Phill: Dawn till dusk
06/08/2018, 18:18 - David;: <Media omitted>
06/08/2018, 18:19 - David;: Could get very close

06/08/2018, 18:30 - Phill: Yeah
06/08/2018, 22:18 - David;: Ronaldo Vieira - English bloke obviously
06/08/2018, 22:19 - David;: Ronny Venables to his mates.
06/08/2018, 22:20 - Rob;: Are Chelsea fucked?
06/08/2018, 22:21 - David;: Look pretty fucked. Hired a manager whose style is completely at odds with their squad structure
06/08/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: Courtois missing from training and Hazard saying he'd like to go
06/08/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: Who have they signed?
06/08/2018, 22:21 - David;: Yeah and everyone wanting out. I think the deliberate policy of constant churn and insecurity is finally catching up with them?
06/08/2018, 22:22 - David;: Rob Green
06/08/2018, 22:23 - David;: A 38 year-old Rob Green and Jorginho
06/08/2018, 22:23 - Rob;: Also Abramovic losing interest / being made to feel unwelcome in the UK over connections to Putin
06/08/2018, 22:23 - David;: Classic case of making a pact with the devil. Famously doesn't work out well.
06/08/2018, 22:23 - Rob;: Still have a big striker problem, unless Morata comes good
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: Jorginho look like a player though
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: A real footballer
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: I fancy him
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: He’s cute
06/08/2018, 22:24 - Sam;: Two feet
06/08/2018, 22:24 - David;: Very cute.
06/08/2018, 22:25 - Rob;: Cute
06/08/2018, 22:25 - David;: But one Jorginho does not a summer make.
06/08/2018, 22:26 - Rob;: Only have until 5pm on Thursday to sign someone else
06/08/2018, 22:26 - David;: Also Luiz looks gone
06/08/2018, 22:26 - Sam;: Stick an Kante (donk) on it
06/08/2018, 22:27 - Rob;: Doesn't do goals, Jorginho. Is he an assistant?
06/08/2018, 22:28 - Sam;: Pass master. The link. He had the best passing stats in Europe last season
06/08/2018, 22:28 - Rob;: Aquarius, the water-carrier
06/08/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: Tottenham's transfer window is interesting
06/08/2018, 22:29 - Rob;: Do you think they'll go on a last minute supermarket sweep?
06/08/2018, 22:35 - Sam;: Looks like Levy hasn’t risen to poch saying they need to be bolder in the transfer market. Sure up some big contracts, bring on more youth, maybe get some silly money off United for Toby jug
06/08/2018, 22:36 - Rob;: They've done well keeping hold of players
06/08/2018, 22:37 - Rob;: With the shit money they pay I've been hoping for them to get picked apart by the bigger clubs
06/08/2018, 22:37 - David;: what's Kane on?
06/08/2018, 22:37 - David;: and alli?
06/08/2018, 22:39 - Rob;: Had to look it up, but he's just gone up to 200K a week
06/08/2018, 22:41 - Rob;: So that's not bad, but he could probably double it again with a nice elsewhere
06/08/2018, 22:43 - Rob;: From last summer:
Dele Ali 50K a week 
Eriksen 75K
Vertongan 100K
Loris 120K
06/08/2018, 22:53 - Paul Dickinson: How shitty are arsenal looking?
06/08/2018, 23:00 - Rob;: Think we've done some sound business, plugged the obvious gaps and had an alright preseason. Might be a shit start considering it's City then Chelsea, but it's a decent squad now
06/08/2018, 23:01 - Paul Dickinson: But Chelsea are looking like the biggest bag of shit possible?
06/08/2018, 23:01 - Rob;: They have the potential to have had the worst window if they sell without replacing
06/08/2018, 23:02 - Rob;: Spurs could be fucked at he start if they don't buy considering how many players we t far in the world cup
06/08/2018, 23:02 - Paul Dickinson: But they’re footballers. They do football
06/08/2018, 23:03 - Rob;: But other footballers have had more than a week's preparation
06/08/2018, 23:04 - Rob;: Sambo who have United signed except Fred?
06/08/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: Lol Diogo Dalot
06/08/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: Do you Diogi Dalot?
06/08/2018, 23:05 - Rob;: Not much, no
07/08/2018, 00:09 - David;: Would Edward Woodward? Yes, Edward Woodwood would.
07/08/2018, 08:29 - Sam;: Dalot will be our Trent hopefully. Could sign alderweirald this week 🤷🏻‍♂
07/08/2018, 08:32 - Phill: >Manshitster PooShyted
07/08/2018, 09:47 - Sam;: So they’ve developed a luck index for football...
07/08/2018, 09:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh I've seen this
07/08/2018, 09:49 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
07/08/2018, 09:49 - Hamish Sinclair: This just conforms everything I've ever known
07/08/2018, 09:50 - David;: Yeah this isn't news.
07/08/2018, 09:54 - David;: Arsenal's Stan Kroenke makes offer to buy whole of London club - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45094538
07/08/2018, 09:55 - David;: The old £557m loan. Pretty shit deposit there.
07/08/2018, 09:55 - Rob;: Yeah, Usmanov realised there was no point owning a minor stake
07/08/2018, 09:55 - Rob;: >Silent Stan
07/08/2018, 09:56 - Rob;: He's such a piece of shit
07/08/2018, 09:57 - David;: Usmanov made a bid for the whole club in 2015?
07/08/2018, 09:58 - David;: But stan was like oh, ah, weeel, no.
07/08/2018, 10:03 - Rob;: I think that was down to corporate law, where you have to make a formal bid for the whole lot once you reach a certain share. I think since Kronke got ahead of Usmanov he's basically controlled the club
07/08/2018, 10:04 - Rob;: Usmanoc has ties to the Everton owner, I imagine he might invest there now he's out of Arsenal
07/08/2018, 10:16 - Sam;: You’ve been Glazered.
07/08/2018, 10:16 - Sam;: The AST will be booted off the board now in the compulsory purchase?
07/08/2018, 10:16 - Rob;: Not sure about that
07/08/2018, 10:17 - Rob;: There is an official fan share system too, would be strange for that to change
07/08/2018, 10:17 - Rob;: He has all the power as it is, no need to get rid of what are affectively good will gestures
07/08/2018, 10:19 - Sam;: But it’s a compulsory purchase.
07/08/2018, 10:19 - David;: Did he appoint emery?
07/08/2018, 10:20 - Sam;: Must have signed off on it on gazidis recco
07/08/2018, 10:35 - Rob;: Yeah probably had a sign-off but not an active rolw. He just wants his clubs  to make him money and that's it
07/08/2018, 10:36 - David;: Ah and you're forced to support that. It's a hicks/gilette scenario.
07/08/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: Yeah
07/08/2018, 10:37 - Rob;: I mean the football people doing stuff might manage to make us competitive, but it will be inspite of the owner
07/08/2018, 10:38 - David;: But he needs revvie from the champs league even to skim off money
07/08/2018, 10:38 - David;: Even if your aim is entirely mercenary sucess pays.
07/08/2018, 11:06 - Rob;: If only Kronke would agree
07/08/2018, 12:34 - Sam;: So courtios is just sacking off training this week then?
07/08/2018, 12:34 - Sam;: Not interested mate
07/08/2018, 12:40 - Rob;: I really, really, really hope they end up with Rob Green in goal
07/08/2018, 12:42 - Sam;: Willy caballero is funny enough
07/08/2018, 12:48 - Rob;: One little injury is all it takes

07/08/2018, 13:05 - David;: Burnley just stockpiling england keepers.
07/08/2018, 13:07 - David;: Should sign pickford and get the clean sweep
07/08/2018, 13:18 - Sam;: Heaton and pope are dead though right?
07/08/2018, 13:48 - David;: Heaton still fully dead?
07/08/2018, 13:48 - David;: How is dislocated shoulder a 6 month injury anyway? Salah got over it in 3 weeks m8
07/08/2018, 13:49 - Jack G;: Just shrug it off surely
07/08/2018, 13:52 - Rob;: Salah not a glove butler though
07/08/2018, 13:52 - Rob;: Might need to build up more strength to stop it happening again as a keeper
07/08/2018, 17:01 - Paul Dickinson: BREAKING: PSG unlikely to sign kante

08/08/2018, 14:16 - Paul Dickinson: The rats are leaving the ship
08/08/2018, 14:31 - Sam;: Not happening
08/08/2018, 14:31 - Paul Dickinson: What about de gea not wanting to sign a new contract?
08/08/2018, 14:44 - Sam;: Courtios to real now happening so nowhere for him to go
08/08/2018, 14:51 - Rob;: The draft at 7pm boys
08/08/2018, 14:51 - Rob;: You can't dodge the draft
08/08/2018, 14:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh, need to make it concise, no pissing around. Like speed chess
08/08/2018, 14:54 - Paul Dickinson: How do we do the draft?
08/08/2018, 14:55 - Jack G;: I’m in
08/08/2018, 14:55 - Phill: Fuck thought it was 8
08/08/2018, 14:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah nah 7
08/08/2018, 14:56 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm just looking at the rules now
08/08/2018, 14:57 - Hamish Sinclair: You can score it head to head rather than classic, might be a good way of differentiating it from the Jules chippet
08/08/2018, 14:58 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah do it head to head
08/08/2018, 14:58 - Paul Dickinson: Magnifies the butthurt
08/08/2018, 14:59 - Paul Dickinson: And everyone has a tense time
08/08/2018, 14:59 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm going to set up the league now so that people can just join at 7
08/08/2018, 14:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Need a name
08/08/2018, 15:01 - Sam;: The 10 Twats One Cup
08/08/2018, 15:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Jokes on you as it's actually a league format
08/08/2018, 15:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you playing Sam?
08/08/2018, 15:03 - Sam;: Lol no. I though head to head was Knockout
08/08/2018, 15:05 - Hamish Sinclair: I think you go head to head and win 3 points in classic football style
08/08/2018, 15:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Right code for league:
320032-74507
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Jack G;: Can we join now in advance then?
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Hamish Sinclair: And start making a list of players you want apparently
08/08/2018, 15:08 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
08/08/2018, 15:09 - Paul Dickinson: I’m getting invalid code
08/08/2018, 15:11 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
08/08/2018, 15:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you definitely applying to a draft league Paul?
08/08/2018, 15:14 - Paul Dickinson: Ah I see it lives outside the realm of the app
08/08/2018, 15:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Just reading the rules:

1. There is no budget, but I think 3 players of one team max still applies

2. It's a "snaking draft" which means the person who goes last in the first round goes first in the second round. This will all be randomly assigned

3. You can make 1 transfer request per week from the pool of players left. Bottom of league gets first pick

4. There are no captains
08/08/2018, 15:19 - Hamish Sinclair: We can have up to 10 players in the league. Do we want to invite others or keep it with the 5-6 We have
08/08/2018, 15:23 - Paul Dickinson: The snake 🐍
08/08/2018, 15:46 - Jack G;: Do we manually choose our players in turn? Just looking at this priority list on the watch list
08/08/2018, 15:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
08/08/2018, 15:47 - Hamish Sinclair: But I think you can set it up incase you arnt there
08/08/2018, 15:47 - Jack G;: 👍
08/08/2018, 15:51 - Paul Dickinson: I’m going to snake my way straight into your draft plans jack
08/08/2018, 15:52 - Jack G;: Snek
08/08/2018, 16:05 - Phill: I don't get it. Now that I've sorted my list, do I even need to be here for it?
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: Someone could take your pick
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: You have to choose who you want manually
08/08/2018, 16:06 - Paul Dickinson: That’s just a watch list
08/08/2018, 16:07 - Phill: Fuck sake
08/08/2018, 16:07 - Phill: What a dick ache
08/08/2018, 16:08 - Jack G;: We’ll need to make our picks quickly too otherwise we’ll be there all night
08/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: It’ll auto draft if you’re not there but it will take 90 seconds
08/08/2018, 16:12 - Paul Dickinson: So you’ll be a right old cunt
08/08/2018, 16:12 - Phill: Trollin'
08/08/2018, 16:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Is Dave still play8ng?
08/08/2018, 16:35 - Rob;: D8ve, are y8u still play8ng?
08/08/2018, 17:16 - Jack G;: Isn’t Dave gumping in France?
08/08/2018, 17:17 - Jack G;: D8ve*
08/08/2018, 17:17 - Paul Dickinson: Slurry FC 👍🏼
08/08/2018, 17:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes but pretty sure he said Wednesday was good
08/08/2018, 18:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Draft incoming
08/08/2018, 18:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Can everyone join the league?
08/08/2018, 18:45 - Jack G;: Looks like we’ve got 5
08/08/2018, 18:47 - Paul Dickinson: Someone call daffy
08/08/2018, 18:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Thoughts on adding others not on the thread
08/08/2018, 18:50 - Phill: Don't muddy it
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Phill: It's shitty enough already
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Murky
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Paul Dickinson: Slurry FC
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Paul Dickinson: Fuck I’m nervous. The snake
08/08/2018, 18:51 - Jack G;: 🐍
08/08/2018, 18:52 - Phill: Just going to the shop, be back before the draw at 8
08/08/2018, 18:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Arse is twitching
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Paul Dickinson: Assume everyone is drafting from the shitter in anticipation of the nervousness
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: I've got a bucket
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: No mains plug in the shitter
08/08/2018, 18:55 - Jack G;: Hope I don’t accidentally select a united player
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Rob;: Isn't it at 7?
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Rob;: And in in 3 mins
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Paul Dickinson: Yep
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Phill: 🎣
08/08/2018, 18:56 - Jack G;: Lol
08/08/2018, 18:57 - Jack G;: If I get first pick I’m taking Salah 👌
08/08/2018, 18:58 - Phill: The autistic choice
08/08/2018, 18:58 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah full autism
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Paul Dickinson: Oh fuck 1min
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Rob;: Tried to use my laptop for this. Booted up an hour ago: installing updates. Current progress: 3%
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Rob;: Phone it is
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Jesus
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Paul Dickinson: So nervous
08/08/2018, 18:59 - Hamish Sinclair: It might start up during this
08/08/2018, 19:00 - Phill: Everyone in draft chat
08/08/2018, 19:00 - Jack G;: Phil
08/08/2018, 19:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Rob
08/08/2018, 19:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you trying to use the full 90seconds
08/08/2018, 19:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Jack you pick again
08/08/2018, 19:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Snake
08/08/2018, 19:04 - Phill: >MAHREZ MAHREZ
08/08/2018, 19:04 - Paul Dickinson: It trolled me. Clicked lukaku
08/08/2018, 19:21 - Rob;: That was so intense
08/08/2018, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh
08/08/2018, 19:21 - Paul Dickinson: I scrolled the player list then it hit me with mahrez
08/08/2018, 19:22 - Hamish Sinclair: I'll trade mahrez with you
08/08/2018, 19:22 - Rob;: It had me down as timed out for my first pick because I hadn't touched the screen for a bit and didn't notify me, then picked Sterling for me
08/08/2018, 19:23 - Paul Dickinson: Mahrez doesn’t seem so bad anymore. Already got some punters after him
08/08/2018, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh it's ranked all the players based on last year so sterling must have been 3rd
08/08/2018, 19:23 - Rob;: I feel like we didn't quite have enough people, I barely had to make any compromises
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Add in another 5 and it would be intense
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah there would be complete shit floating around everywhere
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Hamish Sinclair: You'd have to really grot around
08/08/2018, 19:24 - Rob;: Yeah, horrid. If you're drawn last you have no hope of a top striker
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes but you could nail two good midfielders
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: By the time it came round to player one again there'd only be some real shit going
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: You'd get first and 20th picl
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Paul Dickinson: Thank god I got jota
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Who is jota
08/08/2018, 19:25 - Rob;: What is Jota?
08/08/2018, 19:26 - Paul Dickinson: That I cannot answer with any degree of certainty
08/08/2018, 19:27 - Paul Dickinson: Got siggurdson then. Time for a comeback
08/08/2018, 20:03 - Paul Dickinson: You’ve jota be kidding me
08/08/2018, 20:28 - David;: I guess this is all over? No way of me picking up the dregs?
08/08/2018, 20:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes you can join and pick up the real shit leftover
08/08/2018, 20:31 - David;: Yeah yeah, how do i do that?
08/08/2018, 20:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Think you just add yourself to the league with the code above
08/08/2018, 20:32 - Paul Dickinson: Get deep in the slurry
08/08/2018, 20:32 - Paul Dickinson: You’ll probably still end up beating jack at least
08/08/2018, 20:37 - Paul Dickinson: Courtois to Real
08/08/2018, 21:16 - David;: Yeah yeah, grot fc.
08/08/2018, 21:20 - Paul Dickinson: Managed to make a team?
08/08/2018, 22:20 - Sam;: Just looking through the Chelsea squad on the PL app...

08/08/2018, 22:20 - Sam;: Lol
08/08/2018, 22:21 - Rob;: The Chelsea equivalent of a Diglett Pokémon card
08/08/2018, 22:52 - Rob;: Fulham's squad is great on paper
08/08/2018, 22:53 - Rob;: John Micheal Seri, Mitrovic, Sessingon and Andre Shurrle is pretty good for a promoted side
09/08/2018, 00:58 - David;: Says league closed to new entries. Stay.
09/08/2018, 08:01 - Rob;: Me fucken Yurt Julia and I booked for September has burned down
09/08/2018, 08:01 - Rob;: Well, the mountain it's on has
09/08/2018, 08:02 - Rob;: Heatwaves suck
09/08/2018, 08:03 - Phill: I guess yurt have to do something else.
09/08/2018, 08:06 - Rob;: A whopping 14 airbnbs left in Portugal for our dates
09/08/2018, 08:14 - Rob;: The poetry of the lodge's statement is good at least:
09/08/2018, 08:14 - Rob;: I feel  i need to give some information, although it feels very sad to do so. As if by announcing the death of Eco-lodge Brejeira, it turns it really real. But the fact is: it is real. Eco-lodge Brejeira no longer is. It was burnt to ashes in those gigantic fires that are still terrorising the Algarve. The dream that was has come to an end. We, though, are fine. And by some miracle, our own Yurts survived. Some guardian angels protected our home, and i am immensely grateful for that. The hill is in grief, black and sad, and so are we.
But i believe that dreams cannot burn, so new ones will arise from the ashes. For now, though, we are in survival mode, back to the basics. We need to restaure our water, all deposits and pipes were burnt. We need to clean, clean a lot. 
Then, we will see what's next.
For those who wish to, i have written a letter asking for help. If you would like to receive it, send me your email adress and i will send it.
I want to thank everyone who made this dream be what it was in the last eight years. I want to thank everyone who took a little something from our paradise with them, in their hearts. And i wish that Eco-lodge Brejeira will remain alive in many of those hearts.
09/08/2018, 08:15 - Rob;: 'The hill is in grief, black and sad'
09/08/2018, 09:27 - Stefan;: That's pretty shit, hope there are other yurt options available
09/08/2018, 09:27 - Stefan;: Will Eco-Lodge Brejeira remain alive in your heart though?
09/08/2018, 09:28 - Phill: Love the line: we need to clean. Clean a lot.
09/08/2018, 09:28 - Phill: Catastrophic wild fire

09/08/2018, 10:31 - Jack G;: Looks like we’re signing all the arsenal rejects. First Wilshere, now Lucas Perez
09/08/2018, 10:50 - Rob;: There's a rich history of that, Wright, Boa Morte, ljungberg
09/08/2018, 10:51 - Rob;: I thought Perez looked good when ever he did play, but apparently he was rather shit when he was loaned back to Deportivo last year
09/08/2018, 10:55 - Sam;: Winterburn, suker
09/08/2018, 10:56 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah, I like what I’ve seen. Good finisher, eye for a pass, can do football

09/08/2018, 12:05 - Phill: Why would Maguire take a step backwards?
09/08/2018, 12:07 - Sam;: From 9th to second? Into the UCL?
09/08/2018, 12:08 - Hamish Sinclair: I've heard he doesn't like the look of "the project"

09/08/2018, 16:01 - Paul Dickinson: Is anyone else aware?

11/08/2018, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeh don't think so. Regardless of this window mourinho has spent net 315m since he took over, second only to city
11/08/2018, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Which doesn't take into account the fact they got ibra and Sanchez on frees with ridiculous wages

17/08/2018, 09:11 - Sam;: Some little screb may have made a patch with 18/19 squads but it would require changing the DOB of every player in the game and creating a shit tonne of players. A shit tonne.
17/08/2018, 09:18 - David;: But imagine rebooting the 09 interface with modern players
17/08/2018, 09:19 - David;: It did add a lot when they added the 3d match view
17/08/2018, 09:19 - David;: The level of immersion
17/08/2018, 09:19 - David;: Fm11 was the best imho
17/08/2018, 09:25 - Sam;: I always preferred the dots because of the birds eye view. Shape, formation, seeing it
17/08/2018, 09:44 - Sam;: When was the interface changes to the modern style FM12 or 13. Is too busy and clunky to move between screens. 

I
17/08/2018, 09:44 - Sam;: 7
17/08/2018, 09:54 - David;: Nah, they made the shift on 11 and it was a bit clunky but they tidied everything up by 12/13. Also that relates to your processing power, and you always had option to switch back to the old interface. If you were mental enough to want that.
17/08/2018, 09:55 - David;: Well done, no sauce.
17/08/2018, 09:56 - David;: So you could play FM13 still using the dots
17/08/2018, 10:05 - David;: just checked my fm13 stats on steam. 1,197 hours. Ah.
17/08/2018, 10:05 - Sam;: Yeah yeah yeah. I played 13 with dots, preferring tactical oversight to graphics. If it’s not fifa standard then don’t bother.

Still found 09 to have smother transitions from screen to screen and simpler layouts
17/08/2018, 10:05 - Phill: Can you do FM online league with your mates?
17/08/2018, 10:06 - Phill: Would mitigate against potential gaming abuse as you'd have to wait for your opponent
17/08/2018, 10:06 - Sam;: Yeah think so but it’s turn based so could take forever
17/08/2018, 10:06 - David;: 09 felt a bit too primitive. I liked the tactics engine of 13 better.
17/08/2018, 10:06 - Phill: Yeah yeah, so you'd be forced to take breaks
17/08/2018, 10:07 - Sam;: It’s all about ploughing through to the January transfer window, pretending you’ll stop there
17/08/2018, 10:08 - David;: Yeah, but if you are doing well then you need the rush to continue and if it's going badly you have to end on a win.
17/08/2018, 10:08 - David;: So you can never stop

31/08/2018, 07:52 - Damian Rumble: It's all too do with reference frames. The speed of light is constant to any object moving at a constant velocity. We may observe a rocket with a laser traveling at speed v, but in the rocket's reference frame it is impossible to tell if it is moving, or it is stationary and the entire universe is moving. In that case the rocket only ever experiences a constant speed of light. Special relativity init

31/08/2018, 10:32 - David;: Light has no mass so conservation of momentum irrelevant
31/08/2018, 10:33 - David;: Yes
31/08/2018, 10:34 - Damian Rumble: Also tickets for the 12th
31/08/2018, 10:34 - Damian Rumble: Sorry 11th
31/08/2018, 10:34 - Damian Rumble: Wednesday
31/08/2018, 10:35 - Damian Rumble: There were still some available so you might want to grab some more if several more want to come
31/08/2018, 10:35 - Rob;: I'm going to get the ones for the 12th refunded
31/08/2018, 10:35 - Rob;: As Stefan couldn't make it
31/08/2018, 10:35 - Rob;: We can all go weds
31/08/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: Is it also all-night?
31/08/2018, 10:36 - Rob;: I'll book Thursday off
31/08/2018, 10:38 - Damian Rumble: I think the weekday ones only go till midnight
31/08/2018, 10:38 - Rob;: Lame
31/08/2018, 11:00 - / James Ball: Ah four tet would be good. He just put a live album out on bandcamp. I'm on tour that week though
31/08/2018, 11:00 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
31/08/2018, 11:02 - / James Ball: Oh incidentally, Paul, your parents are super keen to know where I am in the States over the next two weeks in case they can meet up with me
31/08/2018, 11:57 - Paul Dickinson: Ah ok, what’s the schedule?
31/08/2018, 12:12 - Rob;: I'm on my 6th shit of the day
31/08/2018, 12:32 - Paul Dickinson: This is fantastic news
31/08/2018, 12:35 - Rob;: The volume is astounding
31/08/2018, 12:52 - David;: Causes?
31/08/2018, 12:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Chickpea curry ?
31/08/2018, 12:54 - Hamish Sinclair: I've read that the outer layer of a chickpea causes extreme flatulence  but it's broken down when soaked in water or tinned. Would be good to arrange a trial of tinned vs untinned and document resukts
31/08/2018, 12:55 - David;: So it would need to be completely dry to cause the flatulence?
31/08/2018, 12:55 - Hamish Sinclair: No you apparently just immediately cook them from dry, no soaking
31/08/2018, 12:56 - Hamish Sinclair: When you cook dry pulses you're meant to soak them for 24 hours prior to cooking
31/08/2018, 12:56 - Hamish Sinclair: But that's what they want you to do
31/08/2018, 12:56 - David;: Yeah yeah, that would go badly
31/08/2018, 12:57 - David;: Is it only to deal with the flatulencene though? I heard if you dont soak kidney beans they are poisonous or something
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Hamish Sinclair: My knowledge of this subject begins and ends with chickpeas
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: Yeah the NHS recommends to wash all tinned pulses before eating to avoid getting huge flatulence
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Lol public health England are involved
31/08/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: I've heard that about dry kidney beans too
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: But who's buying dried pulses that need days of soaking anyway?
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Other than Judith I've nonidea
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Paul Dickinson: But we want huge flatulence
31/08/2018, 12:59 - Rob;: My shits have been caused by a root vegetable Madras and 5 pints
31/08/2018, 13:01 - Sam;: Pints win prizes (shits)
31/08/2018, 13:01 - David;: Who are they to tell me i can't shart everywhere as much as i want? The nanny state
31/08/2018, 13:01 - Paul Dickinson: Root vegetable madras
31/08/2018, 13:02 - David;: This is why we brexited, to take back control of our arses. Fucking eurocrats tinning our british pulses.
31/08/2018, 13:07 - Phill: Lol just had a bowl of chickpea curry and a yeasty lager for lunch

31/08/2018, 13:16 - Paul Dickinson: Ah the hound. Forgot about that one
31/08/2018, 14:11 - David;: Yeah, very grotty. Always worth revisiting. 'He drew saville as a hounds'
31/08/2018, 14:11 - David;: Broadway 1972, the incredible breakout tour
31/08/2018, 14:17 - Paul Dickinson: Is there anything more grotty than drawing your friend as a hound and giving it as a gift?
31/08/2018, 14:18 - David;: Doing it while also pedoing?
31/08/2018, 14:20 - Paul Dickinson: But it assumes pedo
31/08/2018, 14:20 - Paul Dickinson: It’s like a damning insult to be drawn as a hound
31/08/2018, 14:21 - David;: Did the hound picture not cause anyone to suspect anything?
31/08/2018, 14:21 - David;: Just passed off as your everyday hound picture, nothing that it could be implying
31/08/2018, 14:22 - Paul Dickinson: Just your typical human-hound sketch
31/08/2018, 15:26 - / James Ball: With a ribbed dildo for a nosr
31/08/2018, 15:29 - Rob;: Rolf isn't bad (at drawing) it's quite clearly Saville, as well as an odd dildo wolf

31/08/2018, 20:20 - David;: Hamish I'm having to chug through about 15 2% bud lights that you and sam left here. Apprectiate the free lager but it almost feels like a chore.
31/08/2018, 20:21 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah give it a go
31/08/2018, 20:21 - David;: Is it netflix?

31/08/2018, 20:53 - David;: 'you're dealing with Tony Clifton. Is that frustrating?' 'it is'
31/08/2018, 20:57 - Paul Dickinson: Next Wales we should have Sam in character as Tony Clifton for a whole day. Really make it an arduous time for us
31/08/2018, 21:09 - David;: Lol throwing chairs at the guy as Kaufman
31/08/2018, 21:09 - David;: Just 'in character', nothing you can do
31/08/2018, 21:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Very trolly
31/08/2018, 21:18 - Hamish Sinclair: When he drinks as to My and has to be lifted into makeup
31/08/2018, 21:26 - David;: Apparently Carey has hepatitis, herpes and chlamydia
31/08/2018, 21:46 - David;: Like when Hefner thinks he is talking to Carey as Cliton but it's Bob
31/08/2018, 21:47 - David;: Then Carey shows up
31/08/2018, 21:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Jim carry talks a lot of shit
31/08/2018, 22:00 - Rob;: Isn't he an anti vaccination dick now
31/08/2018, 22:08 - David;: He would be exhausting to be around for any length of time
01/09/2018, 10:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Also Jim casually dropping in that he met up with koufmans daughter as andy koufmanwho he'd never met
01/09/2018, 11:54 - David;: Passanda shits. Endless low density slops and putrid gas.
01/09/2018, 20:37 - David;: Just listening to a great podcast about the 18th century gin craze. This is the most Paul thing ever:

01/09/2018, 23:43 - Sam;: “It’s a sign that we’re not French. We can get intoxicated whenever we want to.”
02/09/2018, 00:44 - / James Ball: Somehow ended up reading about rationing on Wikipedia
02/09/2018, 00:44 - / James Ball: Got to this:
02/09/2018, 00:44 - / James Ball: The scientists found that the subjects' health and performance remained very good after three months; the only negative results were the increased time needed for meals to consume the necessary calories from bread and potatoes, and what they described as a "remarkable" increase in flatulence from the large amount of starch in the diet. The scientists also noted that their faeces had increased by 250% in volume.
02/09/2018, 00:47 - Paul Dickinson: >250%
02/09/2018, 00:47 - Paul Dickinson: Read that as faces to begin with

02/09/2018, 14:15 - David;: Fay says warnock looks like a pedo
02/09/2018, 14:15 - David;: I'd have to agree
02/09/2018, 14:15 - David;: The short sleeves are not helping him

03/09/2018, 17:40 - / James Ball: Stand out tracks?
03/09/2018, 21:03 - Damian Rumble: Think I'm going to have to listen to it a few times more before choosing a favourite

05/09/2018, 13:43 - Phill: Like rob when he sleep walks
05/09/2018, 13:43 - Phill: Hence the taking Tesla private bullshit too
05/09/2018, 13:43 - Phill: Probably thought he was dreaming
05/09/2018, 13:44 - David;: But straight to unfounded pedo claims

05/09/2018, 16:15 - Paul Dickinson: Hit him with the child rapist moniker
06/09/2018, 09:24 - Sam;: Are the health benefits of essential oils bullshit or is there something to it?
06/09/2018, 09:28 - Rob;: They're not essential in the sense that your body needs them and can't synthesise them, like essential amino acids
06/09/2018, 09:29 - Rob;: It means they're oil that contain the characteristic ingredient they're named for - eh frankensense
06/09/2018, 09:39 - Sam;: Guessing there’s some Latin going on in this - lavender and eucalyptus don’t tell my bonce much as names.

Shame I’m not called frank, I could do with some sense
06/09/2018, 09:43 - Rob;: Unless you're a koala I don't reckon you really need much eucalyptus
06/09/2018, 09:50 - Sam;: Lol, cool. I mostly want some plant based assistance with oxygenating the flat when it’s too cold to open the windows. The misses has developed that conversation into a dire need for essential oils.
06/09/2018, 09:52 - Rob;: Oh I see, not consuming them. Actually can they even be consumed?
06/09/2018, 09:52 - Rob;: Why not just get plants?
06/09/2018, 09:56 - Sam;: Yeah I just want dem little ones that don’t shed leaves and barely need watering
06/09/2018, 09:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Oxygenated the flat - is this to cover for your terrible arse
06/09/2018, 09:59 - Sam;: Is there a plant that feeds on methane? I want that
06/09/2018, 10:00 - Rob;: Get air plants. They die if you do water them
06/09/2018, 11:21 - David;: Oxygen gets in through windows. I've been breathing fine with windiws shut for years
06/09/2018, 11:22 - Rob;: Yeah but Sam's turning it into Co2 and methane quicker than it can get in
06/09/2018, 11:22 - David;: Sure. But no plant is going to cut through that
06/09/2018, 11:23 - David;: He's way beyond a couple of ferns in the corner
06/09/2018, 11:23 - David;: Nah but Fay has the same stupid thing with aromatic oils in baths etc. Think you just have to let them have that.
06/09/2018, 11:25 - Rob;: Something to mask the shit is a good idea I think
06/09/2018, 11:31 - Sam;: She’s been convinced that the smells of each oil can reduce stress or anxiety and other effects. Happy to have nice smells I guess
06/09/2018, 11:32 - Phill: Just become a weed addict. Smells good and you'll definitely feel less stressed. Everyones a winner.
06/09/2018, 12:05 - Rob;: I mean if she believes it the placebo effect will probably help it work
06/09/2018, 12:05 - Rob;: As long as you're not spending most of your income on essential oils
06/09/2018, 12:05 - Rob;: No Christmas dinner this year, just more oil
06/09/2018, 12:06 - Sam;: Lol. Quite the wrong oil boom
06/09/2018, 12:33 - David;: Peak essential oil
06/09/2018, 12:33 - David;: Brent crude eucalyptus
06/09/2018, 14:39 - Sam;: Can’t wait for the biopic of Trump, so hard to not make it seem like a parody
06/09/2018, 14:39 - Rob;: I've been thinking this
06/09/2018, 14:40 - Rob;: Will be worth any negative affect on the environment or international affairs
06/09/2018, 16:33 - David;: When is that coming out?
06/09/2018, 16:34 - Rob;: I think Sam meant there will inevitably be one, rather than meaning a specific one on its way
06/09/2018, 16:43 - Sam;: You could make several. I need a lord of the ring style trilogy

08/09/2018, 18:46 - David;: Rules for the interaction between nations league and euros qualificatios are so complicated
08/09/2018, 19:04 - Damian Rumble: I thought I read somewhere that the winners of each division get automatic qualification. That means Gibraltar could get in by winning the shit munching division
08/09/2018, 19:50 - David;: It means there will always be at least one shitmuncher
08/09/2018, 19:51 - Damian Rumble: And we'll definitely manage to lose to them ...

08/09/2018, 21:05 - David;: That's the real referendum.
08/09/2018, 21:05 - Damian Rumble: Maybe a slight edge to the union
08/09/2018, 21:06 - David;: May won't be able to ignore that sort of popular resistance for long
08/09/2018, 21:08 - Phill: Hope those waving union jack's are walking the walk and drinking English sparkling wine.
08/09/2018, 21:21 - David;: Surepy this vintage of british wine is going to be great because of the weather?
08/09/2018, 21:32 - Damian Rumble: It would be if we had the labour to pick it. If only we hadn't given a massive fuck you to those who wanted to come to do those jobs rather relying on our own lazy work shy fuck whits who won't.

10/09/2018, 17:54 - Stefan;: Lol, imagine being the journalist whose editor told them to write this
10/09/2018, 17:56 - Stefan;: "Gases can either be reabsorbed through the gut wall into the circulation and eventually exhaled through the lungs or excreted via the rectum, as a fart."
So it dissolves in your blood, it doesn't literally come out of your mouth in its pure fart form
10/09/2018, 17:56 - Phill: In a 24-hour period all the flatus they expelled was collected via a rectal catheter.
10/09/2018, 17:58 - Stefan;: Why weren't we invited to take part in these experiments?
10/09/2018, 21:49 - David;: Would be a good wales activity
10/09/2018, 21:50 - David;: Rob. Biology. Does light from normal artificial lightbulbs help plants in any way? I.e. will moving them to a room where the lights are on more often in the evening have any impact?
10/09/2018, 22:16 - Rob;: Yeah it does
10/09/2018, 22:16 - Rob;: You can grow plants via electronic lights
10/09/2018, 22:18 - Rob;: But sunlight is best, as they're adapted to that spectrum. But if it's the same amount of sunlight + extra electric light it might help them
10/09/2018, 22:19 - Rob;: Will vary for variegated plants, which are adapted to low level light anyway

20/09/2018, 15:58 - Sam;: I just realised he’s done another photo with a can of soup for scale as well. I hope he really though about which two items are best for showing scale. Ruler? Nah too obvious

25/09/2018, 20:01 - Phill: I'm sorry but we can't just keep having votes. There would be a huge campaign for another vote if remain won the second time round by leave. Respect the referendum. Respect the result. You liberal cunt.
25/09/2018, 20:02 - Jack G;: >more voting being less democratic
25/09/2018, 20:05 - Phill: >tfw when you realise that another vote is a "your opinion means nothing" to 52% of the population
25/09/2018, 20:06 - Stefan;: Leavers didn't respect the result of the first referendum
25/09/2018, 20:18 - Sam;: Yeah but they didn’t get a second. Until the eu was a far different thing. (If you’re talking about those who opposed joining in the first place)
25/09/2018, 20:23 - Jack G;: Can’t wait to be America’s bitch once we hard brexit
25/09/2018, 20:24 - Rob;: I think it's very unlikely that the deal we get, if we get one, will look anything like what the 52% wanted, therefore it's fair to ask them if they still want it
25/09/2018, 20:27 - Hamish Sinclair: If it's still the will of the people then they'll just vote for it a second time?
25/09/2018, 20:27 - / James Ball: Yeah, I'm pretty sure that brexit is going to be quite unsatisfying for everyone involved
25/09/2018, 20:28 - Jack G;: David Cameron is somewhere, laughing with his cock in a pigs anus
25/09/2018, 20:28 - Sam;: I’ll take unsatisfying James. It’s the catastrophe their predicting I’m worried about

28/09/2018, 12:36 - David;: Like I basically didn't sleep for the last week.

28/09/2018, 12:51 - Phill: Sounds like a great idea
28/09/2018, 13:00 - Hamish Sinclair: Go full mage, no weapons or armour
28/09/2018, 13:00 - David;: Is it ever viable to focus on summoning stuff?

29/09/2018, 13:15 - Jack G;: Double honk
29/09/2018, 13:26 - David;: Such a dangerous scoreline though Jack
29/09/2018, 13:27 - David;: Better not to even score that
29/09/2018, 13:28 - Jack G;: Lukaku is bound to score, he’s scored 9 times in a row against us
29/09/2018, 13:30 - Jack G;: Fortunately we have Declan Rice, aka the Irish Busquets
29/09/2018, 13:36 - David;: Ah

29/09/2018, 14:46 - Hamish Sinclair: The net spend doesn't lie
29/09/2018, 14:47 - Jack G;: Offside, deflection, foul in build up
29/09/2018, 14:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Except in this case it does, cos it doesn't include the millions spent on ibra and sanchez
29/09/2018, 14:47 - Jack G;: All fake goals apparently
29/09/2018, 14:47 - David;: And purchase of Pogba pre-Neymar. So inflation adjust that as well
29/09/2018, 14:48 - Jack G;: Would have to give Mourinho a huge payout to sack as well
29/09/2018, 14:52 - David;: Yeah but they probably recoup it by floging pogba emojis to the indonesian market
29/09/2018, 16:48 - Jack G;: 2-0 seems like the score of the day
29/09/2018, 16:48 - Jack G;: Clearly a dangerous score line

01/10/2018, 19:14 - Rob;: Yeah, makings Facebook thread where people can post their registration details. It'll be a mix of pipeline I know who want to go with the idea being that if you get through and have space in your six, you buy a ticket for someone else. And keep trying after you have a ticket

13/10/2018, 10:32 - David;: So Tony was at a country club outside Cardiff for work this week. The wales team was staying there. Apparently he was sitting about 2 metres from Gareth Bale talking to Ramsey about Madrid's form. Slagging off Modric, saying it is because he is too slow. Then Giggsy walked in.
13/10/2018, 10:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Is Ramsey signing for  liverpool?
13/10/2018, 10:39 - David;: He didn't manage to glean that information

15/10/2018, 20:24 - David;: Ah. Ah. Ah. Yeah.
15/10/2018, 20:24 - David;: 3-0
15/10/2018, 20:24 - Paul Dickinson: What is this nations league?
15/10/2018, 20:25 - Paul Dickinson: Dangerous scoreline surely
15/10/2018, 20:25 - David;: Nah we've gone past the danger. Risk free at 3-0
15/10/2018, 20:27 - Rob;: So do we play Croatia one more time then that's  it for the group stage bit?
15/10/2018, 20:27 - Sam;: Yeah
15/10/2018, 20:27 - Rob;: Seems like 4 in a group might be more fun
15/10/2018, 20:30 - Sam;: Yeah three is strange. Must be forced by the number of inty breaks they have to work with
15/10/2018, 20:30 - David;: There are some 4 team groups
15/10/2018, 20:30 - Sam;: Rekt
15/10/2018, 20:30 - David;: But not even numbers because has to divide up all countries
15/10/2018, 20:33 - David;: I mean it's a mess
15/10/2018, 20:34 - Rob;: 4 wouldn't need more breaks necessarily - for example Croatia could be playing the other team tonight, and we could have played them when Croatia were playing Spain instead of having that friendly
15/10/2018, 20:54 - Phill: >tfw when you smoke a big Billy bifta and get immersed in Pillars of Eternity, completely forgetting the England game before checking the score at half time

16/10/2018, 20:45 - David;: Yeah, quarters
16/10/2018, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Quaters. That's got to be in-tents
16/10/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: *quarters
16/10/2018, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: I watch the first few rounds. Is the fit one still in?
16/10/2018, 20:46 - David;: Yeah ruby. Would bang.
16/10/2018, 20:52 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/10/2018, 20:53 - David;: ???
16/10/2018, 20:53 - Paul Dickinson: Terrible picture
16/10/2018, 20:53 - Paul Dickinson: Can’t tell if fit or not
16/10/2018, 20:56 - David;: She is fit but that's a retarded picture
16/10/2018, 20:58 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/10/2018, 20:58 - Damian Rumble: Better
16/10/2018, 20:59 - Paul Dickinson: If I’m not seeing raw gusset how am I meant to tell
16/10/2018, 21:01 - David;: Bake off not know for gusset shots
16/10/2018, 21:02 - Paul Dickinson: Not famed for exposing perenium
16/10/2018, 21:02 - David;: Never been its USP
16/10/2018, 22:15 - Damian Rumble: Went back and watched the whole of GBBO on catch up. To be fair the fit one smashed it out the park. Hollywood on top form. Describing people's baking as 'awful' to their face. Making them cry. Then rounding it off with an unsubtle dig at the Rahul to 'up it next' after he spent the entire show having a mental breakdown due to stress. Delicious.
16/10/2018, 22:21 - David;: <Media omitted>
16/10/2018, 22:21 - David;: <Media omitted>
16/10/2018, 22:21 - David;: Toast on Toast. By Steven Toast.
16/10/2018, 23:28 - Rob;: Manon is also fit
16/10/2018, 23:28 - Rob;: Is she still in it?
16/10/2018, 23:29 - Rob;: Toast of London is great. Hope it comes back
17/10/2018, 00:07 - Damian Rumble: Out this week. Massive controversy
17/10/2018, 00:07 - David;: Ah well. Ruining that episode for him
17/10/2018, 00:08 - Rob;: Yeah thanks mate
17/10/2018, 00:08 - Damian Rumble: I'm sure you'll get over it
17/10/2018, 00:08 - David;: She was fit but almost too French
17/10/2018, 00:11 - Rob;: Too French is a difficult concept for me
17/10/2018, 00:11 - Rob;: And the baking, it's an attractive trait
17/10/2018, 00:12 - Rob;: Naughty punk hair
17/10/2018, 00:12 - Rob;: So naughty
17/10/2018, 00:12 - Rob;: *pink
17/10/2018, 07:04 - Phill: French one grotty. Ruby fit.
17/10/2018, 12:00 - David;: Grotty in a good way?
17/10/2018, 12:02 - Rob;: Definitely a good way
17/10/2018, 12:02 - David;: She's cheeky
17/10/2018, 12:03 - David;: She's got a turn
17/10/2018, 12:05 - David;: But looks a bit like a fish
17/10/2018, 12:07 - Rob;: I think if you met her in a real life context you'd be enamoured
17/10/2018, 12:11 - Damian Rumble: Not for me. No edge
17/10/2018, 12:20 - Rob;: But the turn
17/10/2018, 12:20 - Rob;: The cheeky turn
17/10/2018, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: This lady's not for turning

17/10/2018, 22:50 - Rob;: Autocorrect hates his name so much
17/10/2018, 23:18 - Damian Rumble: Was in front of the sound desk in in bizzare hole in the ground
18/10/2018, 07:30 - Rob;: The layout was mental. We were just behind that bit to the right
18/10/2018, 08:05 - Damian Rumble: I figured it is to be where Orchestra sat back in the day
18/10/2018, 08:06 - Damian Rumble: Carpet every where
18/10/2018, 08:06 - Damian Rumble: I was think of going to a Psy night there in November. That would be extra weird
19/10/2018, 14:29 - Damian Rumble: Phil how do you feel about clegg going to Facebook?
19/10/2018, 14:58 - David;: Strange decision. Trying to repair a lack of trust in a young user base for using their data to manipulate the electoral process. Hire a man best known for breaking an electoral promise to young voters.
19/10/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: Nick Clegg's brother is Julia's CEO
19/10/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: Fun fact for you
19/10/2018, 15:06 - Rob;: Paul Clegg
20/10/2018, 12:29 - David;: This is going to be a classic mourinho 0-0 surely?
20/10/2018, 12:30 - Sam;: Dunno, pretty attacking line up
20/10/2018, 12:31 - Sam;: Don’t think he expects to keep a clean sheet so trying to a get a goal
20/10/2018, 12:37 - Rob;: I want a classic 0-0
20/10/2018, 12:52 - David;: That's set it up nicely
20/10/2018, 12:54 - David;: I've got the tv muted ajd synched up the radio commentary. Game changer - makes it much more intense
20/10/2018, 12:55 - David;: All football should be consumed this way
20/10/2018, 13:07 - Rob;: 6 Music Celebrates The White Album - With Martin Freeman - @bbc6music http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m0000q41
20/10/2018, 13:08 - Rob;: Three hours of Martin Freeman analysing the White Album track by track
20/10/2018, 13:09 - David;: Lol, why Martin Freeman? But i wilk be listening to thay
20/10/2018, 13:11 - Rob;: He does lots of specials for 6 music and is a Beatles nut
20/10/2018, 13:12 - David;: Glass Onion - tune
20/10/2018, 13:42 - Sam;: A mild relief from butt hurt
20/10/2018, 13:46 - David;: Martialiol - provides temporary relief from chronic butt hurt. Ask your manager to prescribe it today.
20/10/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: A double dose!
20/10/2018, 14:11 - David;: Best to sub that
20/10/2018, 14:11 - David;: Rubbish
20/10/2018, 14:12 - Sam;: He’s done his job
20/10/2018, 14:12 - David;: On a hat-trick. That's so clasically mourinho
20/10/2018, 14:13 - Sam;: Don’t think we’ll be pushing for a third..
20/10/2018, 14:14 - David;: But he's fired up as well, confidence flowing. Let him have his 10 little minutes
20/10/2018, 14:21 - Sam;: I decide in two minutes
20/10/2018, 14:23 - Sam;: Fuck sake
20/10/2018, 14:24 - David;: Crufts
20/10/2018, 14:24 - David;: That's what happens. The negative psychological message of the martial sub
20/10/2018, 15:21 - David;: Ah Hamish - the unorthodox captaining of Wilson.
20/10/2018, 22:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Neil Warnock -  "we played some good stuff today" as if he's not in charge of it
20/10/2018, 22:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Backfired massively
20/10/2018, 22:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Live and die by those decisions
22/10/2018, 10:07 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
22/10/2018, 14:42 - David;: Just researching the Warnock team's from the era of the swearing video. The guy he is shouting at about marking is Chris Morgan. He got sent of 12 times in his career. At both the clubs he was at he holds the red card record.
22/10/2018, 14:43 - David;: "On 8 November 2008, during a 2–1 defeat at former club Barnsley, Morgan elbowed Iain Hume as he was waiting for an aerial ball, and Hume suffered a fractured skull as a result whilst Morgan received only a yellow card. Hume underwent emergency surgery and spent 48 hours in the high-dependency unit of a Manchester hospital with life-threatening injuries."
22/10/2018, 14:44 - Sam;: Just letting him know he’s there
22/10/2018, 14:45 - Paul Dickinson: Just seen the picture of that injury
22/10/2018, 14:45 - Paul Dickinson: Half his skull looks to have been reattached after
22/10/2018, 14:45 - Paul Dickinson: Fair challenge
22/10/2018, 14:46 - David;: Just a booking
22/10/2018, 17:32 - Phill: Spent the weekend getting high as fuck and gardening. Drank a bottle of pinot.

22/10/2018, 21:38 - David;: Nope - a napa valley pinot?
22/10/2018, 21:39 - David;: That Ozil goal
22/10/2018, 22:28 - Rob;: The aubemeyang one might be better - great team move
23/10/2018, 12:04 - David;: Stefan I'm going to take that Max Richter song off the playlist not because it isn't good but it was already put on like 2 or 3 playlists back.
23/10/2018, 12:51 - Stefan;: Fair enough
23/10/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: I had the Robyn song on a few times last night
23/10/2018, 12:58 - Rob;: Early scope
23/10/2018, 13:13 - David;: Cunningham?
23/10/2018, 19:04 - David;: Bit of a match on tonight then Sambo
23/10/2018, 19:04 - David;: A game of football if you will
23/10/2018, 19:05 - Sam;: Yeah. Secret weapon on the bench.  Chong
23/10/2018, 19:06 - David;: He's got that all Chong
23/10/2018, 19:06 - David;: A really Chong bench tonight
23/10/2018, 19:07 - David;: Must be better than Sanchez then?
23/10/2018, 19:07 - Sam;: Another reason there was no point signing Sanchez. Had Chong there ready to come into the first team. He plays right wing
23/10/2018, 19:08 - David;: Must be making some obscure trolly point about Sanchez's attitude?
23/10/2018, 19:09 - Sam;: He was injured for Chelsea. Thinks he’s still butt hurt from the injury
23/10/2018, 19:10 - David;: Juventus - great team all the way through and then you see Szczesny in goal.
23/10/2018, 19:10 - David;: Can not even on the bench. Makes his decision to leave even more embarassing for him
23/10/2018, 19:10 - Sam;: Yeah
23/10/2018, 19:10 - Damian Rumble: Thoughts on a proper club world cup sambo?

Fifa set to revive controversial plans for new Club World Cup and Nations League - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/45957030
23/10/2018, 19:10 - David;: Oh actually looks like he's injured as well
23/10/2018, 19:11 - Damian Rumble: Looks like Saudi Arabia is in ...
23/10/2018, 19:16 - Rob;: I think Szcsesny has apparently stepped up pretty well
23/10/2018, 19:32 - Sam;: Not interested. It’ll be shit. Where in the season will they play it
23/10/2018, 20:22 - David;: Fucking hell lindelof's distribution
23/10/2018, 20:22 - David;: Gives it away every time
23/10/2018, 20:25 - Sam;: Getting absolutely dominated here. 28% possession
23/10/2018, 20:28 - David;: How deep the press is is crazy
23/10/2018, 20:28 - David;: At home
23/10/2018, 20:29 - David;: Only press about 15 yards behind the half way line
23/10/2018, 20:29 - Sam;: Only got counter attack to deploy though
23/10/2018, 20:31 - David;: Yeah but effective counter means winning the ball in dangerous open situations
23/10/2018, 20:32 - David;: And actually pressing with intensity to force mistakes
23/10/2018, 20:40 - Rob;: Save
23/10/2018, 21:13 - David;: Lukaku needs a long time to make a decision
23/10/2018, 21:14 - David;: A real procrastinator
23/10/2018, 21:14 - Sam;: Yeah, a bit of a donkey on the ball
23/10/2018, 21:14 - Sam;: Can only do explosive stuff
23/10/2018, 21:14 - Sam;: Or strength
23/10/2018, 21:15 - Sam;: Blastoise
23/10/2018, 21:15 - David;: Was he like that at everton? Rember him running with the ball a lot more
23/10/2018, 21:18 - Sam;: Yeah but they have to do more defending so get more chances to play on they break. Suits a running beast
23/10/2018, 21:20 - David;: True - should suit him here with you playing on counter.
23/10/2018, 21:35 - David;: Postba
23/10/2018, 21:36 - Rob;: No chance that would have stayed out if Szcesney was playing for Arsneal
24/10/2018, 08:10 - Phill: <Media omitted>

24/10/2018, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: My housemate just arrived back from work and immediately disappeared in to the toilet for half an hour. We were out of paper so he had bought some new supplies on the way home and i later noted that this one session has used somewhere between 1/3 and 1/2 of a roll. I feel like this is a little excessive...
24/10/2018, 21:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you calling a big shit or a massive wank?
24/10/2018, 21:39 - Damian Rumble: I mean... I don't really see the notice for the latter but the evidence is irrefutable
24/10/2018, 21:40 - Damian Rumble: *motive
24/10/2018, 21:56 - Phill: >needing a motive to beat the meat

25/10/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: Reading about River Phoenix's death:
25/10/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: According to the 2013 book, Running with Monsters, by Phoenix’s friend Bob Forrest, Phoenix had spent the previous days on a massive drugs binge with Red Hot Chili Peppers’ guitarist, John Frusciante: “[River] stayed with John for the next few days, and probably didn’t get a minute of sleep. The drug routine stayed pretty consistent for all of us. First, smoke crack or shoot coke directly into a vein for that 90-second, electric brain-bell jangle. Then shoot heroin to get a grip and come down enough to be able to carry on a conversation for a few minutes before you start the cycle again,” Forrest wrote.
25/10/2018, 10:39 - Rob;: >shooting heroin to get a grip
25/10/2018, 10:52 - David;: Lol, that's you sobering up and getting a handle on things

26/10/2018, 00:55 - David;: Good Tony moment. Up in ByC. A card game is being explained. He quietly pulls down his sleeve during the explanation, hold it up and says 'look i've won - i've got rid of my hand'. Loving the little pun, rest of the family looking withering.
26/10/2018, 09:43 - Sam;: Still got it
26/10/2018, 09:45 - Rob;: Why have a family of not so you can do that?
26/10/2018, 10:47 - Damian Rumble: I'm at our Norwich office today and the random person I just sat down next to is having a very detailed telephone meeting about the need to stockpile resources in the event of a hard brexit. This shit just got real...
26/10/2018, 10:48 - Rob;: What resources should we be worried about?
26/10/2018, 10:49 - Phill: Tampons
26/10/2018, 10:49 - Phill: For all the liberal bleeding that's going to happen
26/10/2018, 10:50 - Rob;: >liberal
26/10/2018, 10:50 - Damian Rumble: it's labour resources.
26/10/2018, 10:52 - Phill: So you want to stockpile low wage foreign workers?
26/10/2018, 10:54 - Damian Rumble: No if there's a no deal then we won't be able recruit highly skilled workers
26/10/2018, 10:55 - Phill: Why not?
26/10/2018, 11:01 - Sam;: No free movement. Need working visa for Hungarian developer
26/10/2018, 11:01 - Sam;: Zlatko
26/10/2018, 11:01 - Sam;: And brother Bogdan
26/10/2018, 11:02 - Rob;: No Visa for little Pavel to pedal his A-grade UX design
26/10/2018, 11:03 - Phill: If you're skilled, and we need you, you'll get a visa.
26/10/2018, 11:04 - Phill: This is remoaner propaganda. Don't buy into it.
26/10/2018, 11:05 - Rob;: But if you're little Zlatko and you you work in France or Germany without having the hassle of getting a visa you would probably just do that
26/10/2018, 11:08 - Phill: MUH skilled foreign labour market. Just up-skill the British labour force instead. Problem solved.
26/10/2018, 11:10 - Phill: Don't need fuckin Zlatko
26/10/2018, 11:10 - Phill: Brian will do just fine
26/10/2018, 11:12 - Stefan;: The skilled visa system is awful. The numbers are capped, it's massively expensive for the employer and worker, and the system is deliberately hostile
26/10/2018, 11:12 - Stefan;: Bennett is on a visa and it's shit
26/10/2018, 11:13 - Stefan;: We've been trying for decades to close the skills gap and it hasn't worked
26/10/2018, 11:14 - Phill: So just say fuck it let Pjötr and SMINEM fill the gap?
26/10/2018, 11:15 - Phill: Investment and better access to more technical skills is what is needed, not free movement of foreign labour.
26/10/2018, 11:16 - Sam;: Free movement gave us access to technical skills. They just weren’t English
26/10/2018, 11:16 - Sam;: Brother bogdan

26/10/2018, 11:47 - Damian Rumble: Why? When you've been swollowing all the gammon propaganda about 'taking back control'
26/10/2018, 11:47 - Stefan;: Don't feed the trolls Damo
26/10/2018, 11:48 - Damian Rumble: I preferring to think of it as poking the trolls...
26/10/2018, 11:49 - Rob;: Nah this is what Phil lives for
26/10/2018, 11:49 - Rob;: The man who hopes for nuclear war
26/10/2018, 12:28 - Phill: I'd rather be a gammon than a snowflake
26/10/2018, 13:30 - Rob;: So I've had a very slow week at work. Last week was mental Christmas press week, an now everyone with kids is off for half term and there's nothing to sub

26/10/2018, 13:36 - Stefan;: But I can still picture myself scrutinising these in an employment tribunal
26/10/2018, 13:38 - Rob;: There's no background
26/10/2018, 13:38 - David;: How much thought did you out into mapping the personalities to the kitchen objects?
26/10/2018, 13:38 - David;: I've never imagined pepper as feeling insecure
26/10/2018, 13:39 - David;: It's confident, sucessful - it's position as the master seasoning is under no threat surely?
26/10/2018, 13:39 - Rob;: I wanted it to be slightly incongruous
26/10/2018, 13:40 - Rob;: So there's an underlying weirdness in the idea of an aubergine being an architect for example

28/10/2018, 15:32 - Sam;: So ElevenSports have got the rights to la liga and serie A. Just downloaded the app and they put all the match highlights on there for free..
28/10/2018, 15:33 - David;: Not live games though?
28/10/2018, 15:36 - Sam;: Nah
28/10/2018, 15:37 - Sam;: It’s only 5.99 per month or 60 for the year
28/10/2018, 15:37 - Sam;: But if I can just watch the highlights free I will
28/10/2018, 15:39 - Sam;: Ah hold on. The highlights are only free about a week after the match
28/10/2018, 15:40 - David;: Fail Madrid

28/10/2018, 16:27 - David;: That fucking dive
28/10/2018, 16:27 - David;: Disgrace
28/10/2018, 16:29 - David;: Pogba also embarassing himself.
28/10/2018, 16:36 - Sam;: Not a dive. Silly challenge same as xhaka on zaha earlier
28/10/2018, 16:36 - Sam;: Foul anywhere on the pitch
28/10/2018, 16:36 - David;: Got the ball
28/10/2018, 16:37 - Sam;: Nah
28/10/2018, 16:37 - David;: Massive double movement, reacts in unatural way
28/10/2018, 16:37 - David;: He does, foot gets the ball
28/10/2018, 16:37 - Sam;: Took martial out by sticking his leg into his stride
28/10/2018, 16:37 - David;: Then he realises he's lost it so hurls himself to ground
28/10/2018, 16:38 - David;: Look at his movement it's such a clear dive
28/10/2018, 16:38 - Sam;: Well yeah he makes the point but the foul is already committed at that point
28/10/2018, 16:39 - David;: Should get booked for the simulation whatever happens. And the  he gets the ball so also not a pen
28/10/2018, 16:43 - Sam;: It’s not binary. You can get a touch on the ball and foul
28/10/2018, 16:44 - David;: But if the ball is there to be won and you win it and take some of thean at the same time that's not a foul
28/10/2018, 16:44 - David;: *the man
28/10/2018, 16:45 - David;: Not like je slid through the back of him studs first and got some ball at the end
28/10/2018, 16:45 - Sam;: That wasn’t the case for this one. It was flicked past him, he got a little touch then brought martial down
28/10/2018, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: I thought foul until I saw the replay, on second viewing he gets the ball, not a pen
28/10/2018, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: That run up
28/10/2018, 17:07 - David;: I can see why the ref gave it at normal speed but not a pen on VAR
28/10/2018, 17:11 - David;: Great finish
28/10/2018, 17:12 - Hamish Sinclair: What's the name of this commentator? Definitely my least favourite
28/10/2018, 17:14 - David;: I recommend putting the 5 live commentary on - so much more immersive
28/10/2018, 17:17 - David;: Oh actually they are not covering this game
28/10/2018, 17:17 - Hamish Sinclair: But surely it's useless if it doesn't sync?
28/10/2018, 17:18 - David;: Yeah but you just pause it until picture catches up
28/10/2018, 17:34 - Sam;: That’s where pobga fucks people off. Stupid flick
28/10/2018, 17:35 - Hamish Sinclair: And the stupid run up
28/10/2018, 17:36 - Sam;: More the flick as it’s costs us. Did the same thing against wolves
28/10/2018, 17:36 - David;: The run up is retarded
28/10/2018, 17:36 - David;: The run up the fortnite generation deserves
28/10/2018, 17:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Frustrating on the pitch, but those emojis...those sponsership deals...He's the player you deserve
29/10/2018, 09:49 - Sam;: Gearing up for our 6 pointer against Bournemouth this Saturday lol
29/10/2018, 10:11 - David;: Mourinho was wearing a very strong coat at the weekend.
29/10/2018, 10:12 - David;: That was my main take away from the everton game
29/10/2018, 10:14 - Sam;: My take away is that lukaku holds us back. Fred allows pobga to run the game. Matic looks pedestrian now. Rashford is struggling a bit but just need a continued run up front
29/10/2018, 10:15 - David;: Where was fred playing?
29/10/2018, 10:17 - David;: But also that coat - a high neckline, it would really keep the chill off your collar bone
29/10/2018, 10:19 - Sam;: Get me picture of this fucking coat.
29/10/2018, 10:20 - Sam;: Fred was in a pretty fluid midfield 3 with pobga and matic. The engine on the boy
29/10/2018, 10:20 - Sam;: The boy Fred
29/10/2018, 10:21 - David;: What do you do with mata though? He's been playing well
29/10/2018, 10:22 - Sam;: Yeah keep him him tbh. It’s lukaku to drop like he did yesterday
29/10/2018, 10:22 - David;: You certai ly get more movement without romelu
29/10/2018, 10:22 - Sam;: His finishing has gone at the moment as well so you get nothing
29/10/2018, 10:52 - David;: Will have to wait until match of the day is uploaded
30/10/2018, 15:33 - Rob;: The news today that we've lost 60% of all vertebrate populations on average since 1970 has made everything seem quite sureal

30/10/2018, 16:10 - Rob;: Yeah we were just talking about it
30/10/2018, 16:11 - Rob;: Most people know him quite well
30/10/2018, 16:11 - Rob;: A renowned cunt apparently
30/10/2018, 16:12 - Rob;: I'm surprised he even had time to reply, I can barely get my editor to look at a layout
30/10/2018, 16:16 - Rob;: He'll certainly be fired I think, if Waitrose are anything like Tesco
30/10/2018, 20:57 - Rob;: The bake off final has the air of a much anticipated Champions League final tainted by refereeing interventions
30/10/2018, 20:58 - David;: Yeah similar. The pitta fire gimmick stands in for salah's injury on 30 mins
30/10/2018, 20:58 - Rob;: The teams just aren't performing as well as we know they can
30/10/2018, 20:59 - Rob;: Raoul's got concussion
30/10/2018, 21:00 - David;: Stupid challenge as well - the garden thing
30/10/2018, 21:00 - Rob;: A rash challenge
30/10/2018, 21:00 - David;: I think the final showstopped should be freestyle, 4 hours make the most elaborate cake you can
30/10/2018, 21:01 - Rob;: Yeah, you just want people to do the best thing they can and judge them on that
30/10/2018, 21:04 - David;: Setting up a rahul victory. Infuriating
30/10/2018, 21:11 - David;: For fuck sake. Embarassing.

02/11/2018, 18:52 - Rob;: Not sure we will have the personal to achieve that
02/11/2018, 18:53 - Rob;: We're looking at xhaka at left back and Lichsteiner at right back, the classics combo of rash and old
02/11/2018, 18:54 - Jack G;: Salah vs xhaka is terrifying
02/11/2018, 18:55 - David;: Torreira keeping a lid on things. Both sides would probs just about take a point
02/11/2018, 18:56 - David;: Why is there this need to play xhaka at left back? Surely better to throw a centre or right back in there than upset the balance of centre mid?
02/11/2018, 18:57 - Rob;: Maybe, but we have 3 centre halves and injured too
02/11/2018, 18:58 - Rob;: And Bellerin is injured, so can't play a right back there
02/11/2018, 19:03 - Paul Dickinson: A whooping and a bellerin
02/11/2018, 19:06 - David;: Maitland Niles? Call in the old etonian
02/11/2018, 19:07 - David;: Get him back from the Henley rigatta
02/11/2018, 19:13 - Rob;: He's only just back from injury too, but might be fit
02/11/2018, 19:13 - David;: A freak puntng accident?
02/11/2018, 19:13 - David;: *punting
02/11/2018, 19:17 - Rob;: Petanque, I believe
03/11/2018, 12:33 - David;: The ring tailed Lerma
03/11/2018, 12:42 - David;: Bournelona
03/11/2018, 13:42 - Sam;: I’m walking round the Roman baths in bath watching the game. Risking the whole weekend for it
03/11/2018, 13:45 - David;: Did the romans have sky?
03/11/2018, 13:46 - David;: Yeah he does obviously but 'only at the weekends'
03/11/2018, 13:47 - David;: Will mourinho survive this result?
03/11/2018, 13:47 - Sam;: A draw is fine
03/11/2018, 13:48 - David;: That's the new normal. Taking a point at Bournemouth
03/11/2018, 13:51 - David;: Sambo did you see an unknown britjsh person won the euromillions? Must be our pub quiz ticket surely
03/11/2018, 13:54 - Sam;: Lol, no I checked that instantly. Did we no win it
03/11/2018, 13:55 - David;: Weeel. Would rather have had the wine anyway.
03/11/2018, 13:56 - Sam;: Yeah or the haribo
03/11/2018, 14:23 - Sam;: Huge win against our europa league rivals
03/11/2018, 16:34 - Jack G;: Mr. Anderson
03/11/2018, 16:37 - David;: Matrix ref?
03/11/2018, 16:37 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah yeah
03/11/2018, 16:46 - David;: Is your bonce dealing with this?
03/11/2018, 16:47 - Jack G;: Loving it
03/11/2018, 16:53 - David;: Ah he's not in your ff team though - would have made it even sweeter
03/11/2018, 18:04 - David;: The coogan/fowler-ness of emery is ridiculous
03/11/2018, 18:21 - David;: Arsenal looking strong
03/11/2018, 18:29 - Damian Rumble: Definitely going to end 0-0
03/11/2018, 18:49 - Hamish Sinclair: >
03/11/2018, 19:23 - David;: Just saying
03/11/2018, 19:38 - Jack G;: Nostradamus
03/11/2018, 19:42 - Damian Rumble: Anyone care to explain to me how come mane did not get an assist from that game?
03/11/2018, 19:43 - David;: Keeper palmed it out so didn't technically pass it straight to milner
03/11/2018, 19:43 - David;: It's a classic troll scenario
04/11/2018, 19:29 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/11/2018, 21:02 - Rob;: Anyone watching Louis live?
04/11/2018, 21:02 - David;: Yeah yeah
04/11/2018, 21:03 - David;: That guy
04/11/2018, 21:03 - David;: Already its great
04/11/2018, 21:04 - Rob;: Ah, did I no expect the wife with two husbands
04/11/2018, 21:05 - Rob;: That's true feminism, finally
04/11/2018, 21:06 - David;: >'metamor'
04/11/2018, 21:06 - Rob;: A shell of a man
04/11/2018, 21:07 - David;: This guy looks definitely not okay with the situation
04/11/2018, 21:09 - David;: Saying 'we're all quite happy' like they're in a hostage video
04/11/2018, 21:09 - Rob;: Joe's doing well out of this
04/11/2018, 21:10 - Rob;: I can barely breathe
04/11/2018, 21:10 - David;: Jerry surely has to leverage a side shag out of this? Played his hand very poorly
04/11/2018, 21:10 - Rob;: His sighes
04/11/2018, 21:10 - Rob;: He's completely capitulated
04/11/2018, 21:11 - David;: This is great it's like old theroux caliber
04/11/2018, 21:11 - David;: Digging into whimsical grot again
04/11/2018, 21:11 - Rob;: Yeah, nice to take a break from the hard hitting stuff
04/11/2018, 21:18 - Rob;: Gretchen: just too much sex
04/11/2018, 21:18 - Rob;: Had it
04/11/2018, 21:18 - Rob;: Done.
04/11/2018, 21:19 - David;: Louis just awkwardly barging into their fuck cave
04/11/2018, 21:19 - Damian Rumble: Err... What are you watching???
04/11/2018, 21:19 - David;: 'Can i get you some tea'
04/11/2018, 21:19 - David;: Theroux on polyamoury
04/11/2018, 21:21 - Rob;: One woman making him pancakes while he shags the other. Joe knows what he's doing
04/11/2018, 21:22 - David;: This doesnt seem like polyamoury just people breaking up very slowly
04/11/2018, 21:23 - Rob;: Yeah, just honest affairs
04/11/2018, 21:24 - David;: Wouldn't be getting close to her to be honest. Seema very passive agressive
04/11/2018, 21:28 - David;: >nick
04/11/2018, 21:28 - Rob;: That woman getting serviced by her IT department
04/11/2018, 21:28 - David;: The house that grot built
04/11/2018, 21:28 - Rob;: A nerd on both flanks
04/11/2018, 21:29 - David;: The little cuddling demo
04/11/2018, 21:32 - David;: Bob just coming in after nicks foreplay and rutting for hours
04/11/2018, 21:44 - Rob;: The person with two partners is invariably insensitive
04/11/2018, 21:46 - David;: It's so obviously a way of organising it so you can shagothera guilt free
04/11/2018, 21:46 - David;: *others
04/11/2018, 21:51 - Rob;: Yeah, by tethering people who love you to a situation they hate
04/11/2018, 21:51 - David;: That's a cool treehouse
04/11/2018, 22:01 - David;: Jerry quite a tragic figure
04/11/2018, 22:01 - Jack G;: Jerry is broken
04/11/2018, 22:36 - Rob;: I hated Jerry's wife, she's torturing him
04/11/2018, 22:45 - David;: Yeah just have the guts to leave him and get on with his life
04/11/2018, 23:58 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/11/2018, 23:59 - Rob;: Like something from the Wizard of Earthsea novels, but much more europhilic
05/11/2018, 00:00 - Damian Rumble: Love it
05/11/2018, 00:01 - Damian Rumble: But that's mainly based on my love of maps than a particular remoanery desire to see leave places flooded
05/11/2018, 00:01 - Rob;: It's just quite a pleasing map
05/11/2018, 00:01 - Damian Rumble: That being said it is pleasing to Birmingham completely gone
05/11/2018, 00:02 - Damian Rumble: *to see
05/11/2018, 00:02 - Rob;: Royal Leamington Spa Island, the relaxing heart of the country
05/11/2018, 00:03 - Rob;: Although Scotland would surely become the dominant seat of government it currently despises
05/11/2018, 00:05 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
05/11/2018, 00:06 - Damian Rumble: Nah. The capital of Hawaii is honalullu which sits on one of the smaller Islands. If they can make it work so can we
05/11/2018, 00:07 - Rob;: The capital of Hawaii is Washington on the huge landmass to the east
05/11/2018, 00:10 - David;: How have they dissagregated the voting? Doesn't look like parliamentary constituencies
05/11/2018, 00:10 - Rob;: I can't vouch for its accuracy at all
05/11/2018, 00:10 - David;: Also why keep scotland aggregated as a whole voting block - that should be mapped at the same level of granularity
05/11/2018, 00:11 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
05/11/2018, 00:11 - David;: E.g there were leave voting scotish fishing regions
05/11/2018, 00:12 - Damian Rumble: Though admittedly I butchered the spelling
05/11/2018, 00:13 - Rob;: I understand states have capitals, I just think it's funny you chose an island ruled from afar as part of a larger power as your example of the opposite
05/11/2018, 00:14 - Damian Rumble: I did not put a lot of effort into thinking of this example tbh
05/11/2018, 08:14 - Stefan;: Nearly all the nice countryside would be gone though. For a pleasant weekend break from your urban Remain island, you'd have to get a boat to Snowdonia or Scotland
05/11/2018, 10:20 - David;: https://twitter.com/MoSalahFacts/status/1059130221197176832/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1059130221197176832&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bbc.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworld-middle-east-46094658
05/11/2018, 16:26 - Phill: >train cold cunts
05/11/2018, 16:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
05/11/2018, 17:14 - David;: The european super leagie can fuck off
05/11/2018, 17:16 - David;: Football is over
05/11/2018, 17:18 - Sam;: Really would be shit wouldn’t. It a painful full stop on our whole supporting careers
05/11/2018, 17:18 - Sam;: It is a career
05/11/2018, 17:18 - David;: Yeah. Done. Gone
05/11/2018, 17:20 - Sam;: Listening to them discussing it on Sunday supplement. Slamming it a cynical money making move
05/11/2018, 17:22 - Paul Dickinson: What is this super league. Give me context
05/11/2018, 17:23 - David;: Government should intervene to ban it on grounds of regional economic development etc.
05/11/2018, 17:23 - David;: Top 5 are going to leave prem and enter franchise european league with no relegation
05/11/2018, 17:24 - David;: A suoer league if you will
05/11/2018, 17:24 - David;: So prem becomes a husk
05/11/2018, 17:25 - Sam;: I think someone working for sport and culture said the govt would fight it
05/11/2018, 17:29 - David;: Would face massive fan boycotts
05/11/2018, 17:32 - Paul Dickinson: Yeah that’s massively shit
05/11/2018, 17:32 - Paul Dickinson: Especially even more so with no relegation
05/11/2018, 17:32 - Paul Dickinson: Farceball
05/11/2018, 17:47 - Paul Dickinson: Ah Angola won the amputee World Cup
05/11/2018, 17:50 - Rob;: Fuck that
05/11/2018, 17:51 - Rob;: Just fuck it
05/11/2018, 18:03 - Paul Dickinson: It’s all your teams fault though rob. £90 a ticket to the Emirates. You caused this greed
05/11/2018, 18:43 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
05/11/2018, 18:47 - Rob;: I've never actually paid more than £45. It's the TV money not the price of seats that are making clubs do things like this
05/11/2018, 18:56 - Paul Dickinson: There won’t be any prawn sandwiches in the European super league either
05/11/2018, 20:49 - Damian Rumble: I'm watching C4s brexit:what does the nation think program? In all fairness this really is a massive remainer circle jerk. Basically an hour of dressing up a single poll as a definitive evidence that nigel farage is a cunt
05/11/2018, 20:56 - Rob;: Yeah it's been very annoying
05/11/2018, 20:57 - Rob;: It's a big poll, but they're treating it like a referendum
05/11/2018, 20:58 - Rob;: Sir stats man poured cold water on it anyway 'people who never vote still think what they always think but won't vote for'
06/11/2018, 09:04 - Phill: Just watched theroux
06/11/2018, 09:04 - Phill: >Jerry
06/11/2018, 09:04 - Phill: >nick
06/11/2018, 09:04 - Phill: >not being Joe
06/11/2018, 09:04 - Phill: The hippie foursome seemed the most normal
06/11/2018, 09:05 - Phill: Bob just pounding away for hours on end whilst nick plays video games
06/11/2018, 09:05 - Phill: So grotty
06/11/2018, 11:40 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-46108083
06/11/2018, 12:00 - Jack G;: Very puntastic
06/11/2018, 12:49 - David;: 'Talking about feacal sludge at the dinner table'. And that's Gates.
06/11/2018, 13:08 - Sam;: Any want some free Q?
06/11/2018, 13:08 - Sam;: Initiative Q is an attempt by ex-PayPal guys to create a new payment system instead of credit cards that were designed in the 1950s. The system uses its own currency, the Q, and to get people to start using the system once it's ready they are allocating Qs for free to people that sign up now (the amount drops as more people join - so better to join early). Signing up is free and they only ask for your name and an email address. There's nothing to lose but if this payment system becomes a world leading payment method your Qs can be worth a lot. If you missed getting bitcoin seven years ago, you wouldn't want to miss this.

Here is my invite link: https://initiativeq.com/invite/Bz2S-GJTX

 This link will stop working once I’m out of invites. Let me know after you registered, because I need to verify you on my end.
06/11/2018, 13:08 - Damian Rumble: Still got my bitcoins mate
06/11/2018, 13:08 - Sam;: This is the new hypecoin
06/11/2018, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: CBA getting involved in another pyramid scheme
06/11/2018, 13:09 - Sam;: Always one. Ponzi was a great guy
06/11/2018, 13:54 - David;: What could go wrong? Pyramids are such a stable structure
06/11/2018, 13:59 - Paul Dickinson: How much Q is a pint of milk?
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: Q currently has no monetary value
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: But it’s free mate
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: Free Q
06/11/2018, 14:00 - Sam;: Q can’t go wrong
06/11/2018, 14:01 - David;: Can you call something free that's worth nothing?
06/11/2018, 14:02 - Paul Dickinson: Sucked in by the Q hype. They’ve probably just added you to a mailing list of people susceptible to absolute shite and then just sell on your details
06/11/2018, 14:02 - David;: 'They're giving out free fecal sludge over there, quick sign up'
06/11/2018, 14:03 - Sam;: But What if fecal sludge become the most used fuel worldwide ?
06/11/2018, 14:03 - Sam;: Sister sludge would be sitting on a gold mine
06/11/2018, 14:04 - Paul Dickinson: If it’s free why can’t you just be a good old Lad and get all the q fir us
06/11/2018, 14:04 - Sam;: I am, it’s referral only.
06/11/2018, 14:05 - Sam;: My link gets 5 people in
06/11/2018, 14:06 - Paul Dickinson: Sounds like a big ole piece of shite
06/11/2018, 14:06 - Damian Rumble: This is exactly what is happening
06/11/2018, 14:06 - Sam;: It probably is but if they get it right..
06/11/2018, 14:07 - Sam;: You’ll be looking at My sludge pile with envy
06/11/2018, 14:07 - David;: 'The wise man built his house upon an upside down pyramid' - Matthew, 7:24
06/11/2018, 14:07 - Damian Rumble: But surely by printing 'money' and giving it away for free they are actually reducing value?
06/11/2018, 14:08 - Damian Rumble: Flooding the market with sludge
06/11/2018, 14:08 - Sam;: It’s as if you haven’t watched the promo video..
06/11/2018, 14:08 - Rob;: Well i'm in
06/11/2018, 14:09 - Rob;: Free nothing
06/11/2018, 14:09 - Rob;: How much nothing do you get as a referral fee, Sam?
06/11/2018, 14:10 - Sam;: Q2492
06/11/2018, 14:10 - David;: Infinity x fuck all = fuck all
06/11/2018, 14:10 - Sam;: How can infinity kiss?
06/11/2018, 14:11 - Rob;: But zero to the power of zero is often considered one
06/11/2018, 14:11 - Rob;: How could if fail once you know that?
06/11/2018, 14:15 - Damian Rumble: Alot of that promo video is very Wizard of Oz. There's a lot of tapping of heels together, handing over of contact details and trusting that, through the power of 'technology' you will definitely become rich
06/11/2018, 14:16 - Sam;: It’s just an email address..
06/11/2018, 14:16 - Sam;: The platform will launch in late 2021
06/11/2018, 14:16 - David;: Feacal to the power feacal = feacal
06/11/2018, 14:17 - Damian Rumble: I also don't buy thier assertion that 'currencies become more valuable as the become more popular'. I think they need to have some kind of Intrinsic value to start with and then that will increase.
06/11/2018, 14:17 - Damian Rumble: Even sludge has value
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Sam;: That’s what the platform is about a global marketplace where currency is easier to pay with and take payment of. They reckon they’ll butt fuck Bitcoin
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Sam;: The rumbix cube
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Rob;: You guys are going to hate 2021 when Sam and I are trillionaires
06/11/2018, 14:19 - David;: The value of money derives from its position in social and political institutions and is grounded in generalised trust. Intrinsic value is a bad way of thinking about it.
06/11/2018, 14:19 - Rob;: *trillionaires in Q
06/11/2018, 14:20 - Sam;: Qdogs
06/11/2018, 14:20 - David;: Q must be mad
06/11/2018, 14:20 - David;: Are Q joking mate?
06/11/2018, 14:20 - Sam;: The HQ is in Quebec
06/11/2018, 14:21 - Rob;: I'm very confident
06/11/2018, 14:21 - David;: The Qban missile crisis
06/11/2018, 14:23 - Sam;: You need to click your email to verify yourself Rob.
06/11/2018, 14:24 - Sam;: Check junk folder. Lol
06/11/2018, 14:25 - Rob;: Yeah, right into my spam. I can't see why.
06/11/2018, 14:26 - Jack G;: Your email client knows
06/11/2018, 14:31 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
06/11/2018, 14:32 - David;: What did you buy your bitcoin for damo?
06/11/2018, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: Around about 7USD per coin
06/11/2018, 14:40 - David;: So you're still up a fair bit - how much did you buy?
06/11/2018, 14:40 - Sam;: It’s a long term strategy damo.
06/11/2018, 14:41 - David;: Did you sell any at the peak?
06/11/2018, 14:41 - Phill: Lol two trillion coins. So if each Q has a value of $1, the tech has a market capitalisation of $2trn. 2 Apples. Good luck.
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: Nah that’s the amount being given away
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: Read the roadmap
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: The highway to hell
06/11/2018, 14:43 - Damian Rumble: Well I could probably be up quite a lot more if I hadn't had spent most of it on drugs...
06/11/2018, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: But if you take that into account it's probably somewhere between £500/£1000
06/11/2018, 14:45 - Jack G;: Sam, this all sounds too good to be Q
06/11/2018, 14:45 - David;: How much did the fbi nick?
06/11/2018, 14:45 - Damian Rumble: Oh yes I forgot about that. The it's deffo around £500
06/11/2018, 14:46 - Damian Rumble: If I had the stuff the FBI has and also some I lost in a marketing than ran an exit scam then probably several thousand
06/11/2018, 14:46 - David;: 👌
06/11/2018, 14:47 - Damian Rumble: Total invested is probably about £200??
06/11/2018, 14:48 - David;: 'A marketing than ran an exit scam'???
06/11/2018, 14:49 - Damian Rumble: A dark web market I had money just stopped trading one day and stole everyone's money
06/11/2018, 14:49 - Damian Rumble: *had money in
06/11/2018, 14:50 - David;: Wait surely if you bought at $2 dollars and it's now $4,000 odd it would be worth a lot more than £500?
06/11/2018, 14:53 - Damian Rumble: Yeah but I sold a lot in 2014 after a lost a chunk around the first bubble
06/11/2018, 14:54 - Damian Rumble: I mean if you're asking if I had never bought our traded the coins once a bought them then i would probably into the 10,000USD...
06/11/2018, 14:56 - David;: But even if you only had £1 left of your original purchase it wpuld be worth £2,500 now, as it's gone up from £2 per coin to £5,000 per coin
06/11/2018, 14:57 - Damian Rumble: I think the mood in 2014 when the crash happened was that this was the end of bitcoin so I got everything out then
06/11/2018, 14:58 - David;: Ah right so you didn't keep any
06/11/2018, 16:35 - / James Ball: PayPal took at least 10 years to become accepted by major banks. How long will it take Q in the much more saturated market?
06/11/2018, 16:39 - / James Ball: What's the incentive to use Q over any other currency? Certainly not anonymity as it offers none of the benefits of real blockchain currencies in that regard

07/11/2018, 12:22 - Phill: Stefan need some legal advice
07/11/2018, 12:23 - Phill: The guy at work moved into a new flat. There was a contract written up but he didn't sign it. The flat turned out to be shit, so he moved out. He informed the landlord but the landlord said that the contract was valid given that he had moved in, payed the first month's rent etc. It didn't seem to matter that nothing was signed.
07/11/2018, 12:23 - Phill: Landlord now saying he's liable for full tenancy rent payment.
07/11/2018, 12:23 - Phill: Whit do?
07/11/2018, 12:31 - Stefan;: Yeah I think by moving in and paying rent he's implicitly agreed to the tenancy terms. It doesn't necessarily have to be signed to take effect
07/11/2018, 12:44 - Sam;: Can the the state of the flat be deemed a breach by the landlord?
07/11/2018, 12:45 - Jack G;: I imagine it would have to be in a state of disrepair
07/11/2018, 12:45 - Damian Rumble: In all fairness the guy probably should have visited this place before agreeing to live there
07/11/2018, 12:56 - Stefan;: Yes, but it only entitles you to claim damages. You still have to pay rent until the tenancy is validly terminated by either side - you can't usually withhold rent because of disrepair
07/11/2018, 12:58 - Stefan;: And damages would only be equivalent to the full rent if it's literally uninhabitable - usually you'd get less
07/11/2018, 12:59 - Phill: It wasn't the flat, it was his co-tenants.
07/11/2018, 12:59 - Phill: Noisy alcoholics
07/11/2018, 12:59 - Phill: Up all night.
07/11/2018, 13:13 - Sam;: Watching America
07/11/2018, 13:29 - David;: Think that weakens his case further because landlord can claim the behaviour of flatmates is not his fault?
07/11/2018, 13:31 - David;: That's pretty mental. So you can be living in a dingy dank leaky shithole but if it's inhabitable there's no way to break tenancy early?
07/11/2018, 13:32 - Jack G;: Not surprising, a huge percentage of Tory MPs are landlords
07/11/2018, 13:34 - David;: True, but the legislation that set out that relationship predates this government i would imagine. And would probs be determined by a lot of case history?
07/11/2018, 13:36 - Rob;: Would the payment of the rent imply agreement for the terms only for the duration big the rent paid though?
07/11/2018, 13:37 - Rob;: Ie. Only one month, not the full duration of the unsigned contract? Normally when you come to the end of a tenancy agreement but remain in a property paying rent it's treated as a rolling month's contract
07/11/2018, 13:50 - Jack G;: He should have got some Q and he’d be able to bail himself out of this situation
07/11/2018, 14:00 - Stefan;: Nope. Only by giving 2 months notice (during which you still have to pay rent)
07/11/2018, 14:00 - Stefan;: It's all from the Thatcher/Major era. Before that all private tenants had security of tenure

12/11/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: Wish the baby had Patatas as his surname. Adolf Potatoes
12/11/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: Calum's 30th
12/11/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: Had a _family_ home in Cardiff
12/11/2018, 20:00 - Rob;: 20°C at all times
12/11/2018, 20:01 - Sam;: It was great
12/11/2018, 20:46 - David;: Lol, drunk on the sheer audacity of his thermostat use.
12/11/2018, 20:46 - David;: Forget the booze, you come mainly for the ambient warmth.
12/11/2018, 20:47 - Phill: The heat was punishing. I felt cooked when I woke up in the morning.
12/11/2018, 20:48 - David;: It's the dehydration that gets you more than the booze with a hangover anyway.
12/11/2018, 20:48 - David;: Could you not have opened a window?
12/11/2018, 20:51 - Rob;: Phil's wouldn't open

14/11/2018, 10:03 - Damian Rumble: Next season though. I'm getting my beers in now whilst it's 1000:1
14/11/2018, 10:03 - Damian Rumble: *Bets
14/11/2018, 19:28 - Rob;: We are so heading for rejection of the agreement and no deal
14/11/2018, 19:29 - Phill: THANK FUUUUCCCKK
14/11/2018, 19:29 - Phill: The proposed deal was an absolute piece of shit
14/11/2018, 19:32 - Phill: Lol just seen her statement. This, no deal or no Brexit
14/11/2018, 19:35 - Jack G;: Let’s fucking vote on these 3 options then. Ranked preference
14/11/2018, 19:37 - Phill: 1. No Deal
2. No Brexit 
3. Deal worse than remaining
14/11/2018, 19:40 - Rob;: That's why it will fail. It pleases no one
14/11/2018, 19:41 - Jack G;: It could please moderates who want brexit but can’t be arsed with it in the commons/news anymore. Although they’d be wrong
14/11/2018, 19:42 - Rob;: But that would only count if it goes to a referendum, which seems very unlikely
14/11/2018, 19:42 - Rob;: MPs will reject it and then it'll be no deal
14/11/2018, 19:43 - Jack G;: I really doubt MPs will reject it without there being some sort of mechanism to avoid no deal
14/11/2018, 19:43 - Jack G;: Which is what May is counting on
14/11/2018, 19:43 - Phill: I'd reject the fuck out of it.
14/11/2018, 19:44 - David;: Ironic that the hardest brexiteers are those opening a possible door to no brexit
14/11/2018, 19:45 - David;: This is why i think she may scrape it through commons by a whisker. Unfortunately.
14/11/2018, 19:46 - Rob;: It'll be well tight I think - there are motives on both sides to reject it
14/11/2018, 19:47 - David;: Few labour rebels who fear no deal more than this plus a few brexiters who don't want to compromise the whole thing or open door to general election/second ref swinging behind it.
14/11/2018, 19:47 - David;: That's all it needs really.
14/11/2018, 19:48 - Rob;: It'll be interesting
14/11/2018, 19:49 - Rob;: Interesting like watching both granddads fight each other over which hole to fuck your mum in
14/11/2018, 20:18 - David;: If you don't eat yer meat yer can't have any Brexit. How can you have any brexit if you don't eat yer meat?
14/11/2018, 21:05 - Stefan;: I think it'll fail in parliament. Labour will vote against it (it fails their 6 tests) and so will the rest of the opposition. Only then needs the DUP or a few Tory rebels to rebel and it'll fail.
14/11/2018, 21:17 - David;: Yeah but that's assuming all labour MPs follow whip. Can't see that happening especially as loads of them are completely alienated from the leadership anyway.
14/11/2018, 21:18 - Stefan;: There are still enough Tory remainer and hard Brexiteer rebels though
14/11/2018, 21:19 - Jack G;: I think they’ll be a leadership election before it gets to a vote anyway tbh
14/11/2018, 21:21 - David;: That's the question really. Do labour pro-deal rebels outnumber tory anti-deal rebels. But she can also bribe them with cushy jobs etc. to bring them around - their anti-deal stance could be partly a bargaining/negotiating chip outside of the real ideologues like Mogg.
14/11/2018, 21:22 - David;: The ERG is only like 50 mps right?
14/11/2018, 21:30 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
14/11/2018, 21:32 - David;: Fuck sake - just give us orgies, gambling and autists louis
14/11/2018, 22:22 - Damian Rumble: Hate to agree with Phil but I agree. We will become rule takers (pretty much what remain were saying during the ref.).
14/11/2018, 22:23 - Damian Rumble: Pretty sure I read somewhere that the DUP were planning to vote against
14/11/2018, 22:25 - Damian Rumble: If there's no clear Brexit agreement by the 21st of January then I think parliamentary powers start to kick in. They should be able to force the government to extend article 50 to avoid no deal (I hope)
14/11/2018, 22:27 - Damian Rumble: Nah. There's about 10 that would vote for but that's easily countered by the DUP, 40 Tory brexiters and 20 Tory remainers not voting for it
14/11/2018, 22:29 - Damian Rumble: Can't really see May surviving a no vote. She totally owns this plan a rejection would be fatal to her authority. Who takes after that is anyone's game though ....

15/11/2018, 00:46 - David;: Great joke
15/11/2018, 07:54 - Rob;: I think it's worked out puns/musdirection - so once it's chosen Tony Hawk it's punning on hawk, as if Tony is literally a bird. Then it's chosen a bird fact - they have hollow bones
15/11/2018, 08:58 - Jack G;: Raab gone, already at 2 resignations. Any bets?
15/11/2018, 08:58 - Damian Rumble: Ah... It was looking good for may for a short period there
15/11/2018, 08:59 - Jack G;: Well she’s brought the country together at least. In disgust at her “deal”

15/11/2018, 09:03 - Phill: Today's going to be a great day. So much chaos. Turmoil. Butthurt. I thirst for these days. I am quenched.

15/11/2018, 09:54 - Rob;: As Brexiteers secretary the deal can't have been news to Dominic Raab, he will have had a role in drafting it. A man who can't support is own work

15/11/2018, 10:07 - Damian Rumble: McVey gone now

15/11/2018, 10:14 - Phill: Shame about McVey. Bit of eye candy for the lads. Patel. McVey. The Tory party naked calendar is running out of July's.

15/11/2018, 17:31 - Phill: His tour is already sold out and we can sell our tickets for £1k so I'm hoping

At the time of viewing it was unfurnished despite being advertised as furnished. As part of the contract we agreed it would be 'fully furnished' and I also sent a list defining what that was. We are now finding out that the landlord bis trying to give us the barest of essentials. Is there any legal frame work for us backing out and getting out holding deposit back on the basis of false advertising/breach of contract?

25/11/2018, 22:50 - Damian Rumble: Dave - planning a little too to California in January. Primarily based on LA but also thinking of road tripping it up to SanFran. Recommendations on things to do please? Both in and out of the cities
25/11/2018, 23:01 - Stefan;: Big Sur is a beautiful coastline to drive along. There's Napa and Sonoma wine regions near SF. And Yosemite if you have the time (further inland)
25/11/2018, 23:11 - David;: Yeah. I wouldn't personally recommend Napa that much, the tastings are fucking expensive and marked up for tourists; you can buy all the wine cheaper just in wine shops. Depends how much time you have. The best places I've been are Death Valley, Joshua Tree and Yosemite, but they are a bit of a drive to the east. Lake Tahoe is great for a weekend skiing - again, a drive to get there. If you want to stay on the coast then yeah, Big Sur is good for Redwoods and walking - Humbolt is even better but its further up the coast. Monterrey you can get very cheap and reliable whale watching boat trips if you're interested. I was underwhelmed by the aquarium but everyone else seems to rate it.
25/11/2018, 23:13 - David;: If you want to see Joshua Tree np cheaply you can camp on at these sites owned by the bureau of land management for free, there's one in twentynine palms. Then drive down through the desert and do walks etc. That's pretty cool.
25/11/2018, 23:19 - David;: In SF hiring a bike and going over GG bridge to sausilito is worth it. Golden Gate park also decent. The mission district has good restaurants and street food. The museums are shit, it seems like you need to have conquered a quarter of the world to have decent museums. Bit further south is half moon bay which has decent beaches.
25/11/2018, 23:23 - David;: I suppose you'll want to get the cleched selfie outside facebook headquarters and embarass yourself.

25/11/2018, 23:26 - David;: Is LA set in stone? Because I'd highly recommend getting out of the cities and seeing the national parks if you still have flexibility
25/11/2018, 23:26 - David;: Competely unique and scope everywhere
25/11/2018, 23:27 - Damian Rumble: We are playing in a tournament on Huntington beach but we all agree we'd rather not spend the rest of the time in the city. We are talking about hiring a car and driving to alot if the national parks a week either side
25/11/2018, 23:33 - David;: Yeah, definitely Joshua Tree then, it's pretty close to LA only like a 3-4 hour drive. And quite small you only need like 2 days to see it.

05/12/2018, 21:44 - Sam;: Ok one positive. The Chelsea result
05/12/2018, 21:45 - David;: Yeah everyone can appreciate that

06/12/2018, 10:43 - Rob;: Sequel to Phantom of the Opera
06/12/2018, 10:44 - Jack G;: Surely you’d need to not have a rectum to experience phantom rectum?
06/12/2018, 10:44 - Rob;: There's a thing in the BBC today about living with a stoma
06/12/2018, 10:44 - Rob;: BBC News - Why do people experience phantom rectum?
http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/disability-46426300
06/12/2018, 10:44 - Rob;: Ah it is that
06/12/2018, 10:45 - Sam;: That it is
06/12/2018, 10:45 - Rob;: I read it and don't remember the phrase phantom rectum being in there
06/12/2018, 10:45 - Sam;: The phantom phantom rectum
06/12/2018, 10:46 - Rob;: I mean she's just got shit coming out of her stomach now instead of her arse. What's phantom about it.
06/12/2018, 10:46 - Rob;: There's no ghost anus
06/12/2018, 10:47 - Jack G;: Maybe she has a spooky sphincter?
06/12/2018, 10:48 - Sam;: but she no longer has a rectum. her arse is boarded up
06/12/2018, 10:48 - Sam;: like an abandoned mine shift
06/12/2018, 10:48 - Sam;: shaft
06/12/2018, 10:55 - Rob;: So if it's a phantom rectum in the sense of a phantom limb she'll be feeling like she's still got a working anus - convinced she's shitting when she isn't
06/12/2018, 11:01 - Sam;: Yeah

07/12/2018, 17:32 - Rob;: I haven't organised a birthday yet
07/12/2018, 17:33 - Rob;: Small this is the first birthday thing you've done since go karting circa 2004. Will be coming
07/12/2018, 17:33 - Rob;: Small = Sam
07/12/2018, 17:33 - Phill: Yeah we'll be there.
07/12/2018, 17:47 - Sam;: No worries damo. Laura talked me into. Already got big game nerves
07/12/2018, 17:47 - Phill: Banners or Oxford?
07/12/2018, 17:48 - David;: What is this? I'm off the facebook wagon now
07/12/2018, 17:49 - Phill: Sambos mad night out
07/12/2018, 17:49 - Stefan;: Ah bad timing Sam, I'm doing my own 30th weekend away with London friends the same day. Would have been up for coming otherwise
07/12/2018, 17:50 - Rob;: But you're 30 next week Stefan
07/12/2018, 17:51 - David;: You've always been the caretaker
07/12/2018, 17:51 - Rob;: I'll do mine on Paul's birthday

07/12/2018, 18:08 - Paul Dickinson: Hiring out a venue in banbury
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Paul Dickinson: Hire out a village hall like old school parties
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Paul Dickinson: Hooky sports club
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Rob;: Great Rollright village hall is great
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Rob;: It's got a fridge
07/12/2018, 18:09 - Rob;: Field out the back. Sorted
07/12/2018, 18:10 - Sam;: Looking at attic in banners
07/12/2018, 18:10 - Phill: Prefer cellar myself
07/12/2018, 18:11 - Paul Dickinson: Room in the back of spoons
07/12/2018, 19:57 - Sam;: Shotgun is out for this one. I’m gonna have to judge it on biggest need.
07/12/2018, 19:58 - Phill: Fair. If it's in Banbury we can stay at my mum's
07/12/2018, 19:59 - Sam;: Yeah That would help
07/12/2018, 20:00 - Phill: So can one or two others
07/12/2018, 20:00 - Phill: Share a taxi
07/12/2018, 20:00 - Paul Dickinson: Yarp
07/12/2018, 20:52 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 07:25 - Phill: Had a dream last night that we were at ByC and a nuclear war was declared. You could see nuclear warheads flying through the blue sky over Cader.
08/12/2018, 08:38 - Rob;: Beautiful
08/12/2018, 08:39 - Phill: Yeah it was great, they didn't fly fast, they almost floated by, they all looked different too we were just sitting outside looking up saying shit like "that looks American"
08/12/2018, 08:40 - Rob;: BYC is such a good apocalypse fantasy house
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Damian Rumble: Going to byc is my zombie escape plan
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Rob;: Although do you remember how big that Russian bomb was? The one we dropped down the Crown and Cushion and it wiped out your house in Gloucester
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Phill: The Tsar Bomba
08/12/2018, 08:41 - Phill: 50 Mt
08/12/2018, 08:42 - Rob;: Yeah I've said to Julia she'll have to put up with living with you all if there's a zombie apocalypse as we'd all have the same plan
08/12/2018, 08:42 - Rob;: I have a zip van just outside my portfolio I'd fill with cans and makeshift weapons. Savage fighting my way down the M1 though
08/12/2018, 08:43 - Rob;: If that fell on say Liverpool would BYC be fucked
08/12/2018, 08:43 - Phill: Would probably be ok
08/12/2018, 08:44 - Phill: Think ByC is far enough away from any significant city
08/12/2018, 08:44 - Phill: My house is only 30miles from chippy
08/12/2018, 08:45 - Phill: We would need weapons as we'd need to do looting runs to dolgellau
08/12/2018, 08:45 - Phill: We'd have to form a partnership with the farmer. He's probably got some shotguns
08/12/2018, 08:46 - Damian Rumble: Unfortunately the only downside of moving to London is that the odds of surviving an  apocalypse have considerably lengthened
08/12/2018, 08:46 - Phill: The spring water also wouldn't get polluted by fallout which is a bonus
08/12/2018, 08:47 - Phill: >zip van outside my portfolio
08/12/2018, 08:48 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 08:49 - Rob;: I meant flat, autocorrect new better
08/12/2018, 08:49 - Rob;: Which I imagine he'd use to kill us to stop us wrecking his own survival plan
08/12/2018, 08:50 - Phill: Nah I think we could be diplomatic. Safety in numbers. We could offer protection, work the farm.
08/12/2018, 08:51 - Phill: There would be roaming groups of chavs looking for resources. He'd want some more people on side I think.
08/12/2018, 08:52 - Phill: He was with us in my dream.
08/12/2018, 08:52 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 08:52 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 08:53 - Phill: The most valuable thing in my dream was the engine of the warhead (bits of the missiles fell off as it flew, much like a rocket)
08/12/2018, 08:53 - Rob;: So I think if Tsar Bomba was dropped on Liverpool or Dublin while we were in BYC we'd get our precious windows smashed
08/12/2018, 08:53 - Phill: So we would be OK, just
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Rob;: Yeah, very, very narrowly
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Phill: They'd probably save those big ones for London
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Rob;: Same with Cardiff
08/12/2018, 08:54 - Phill: Only drop some shitty little 10Mt on Liverpool
08/12/2018, 08:55 - Rob;: Although I can see all Welsh cities coming out of a nuclear war completely unscathed die to lack of foreign knowledge as to what Wales is
08/12/2018, 08:55 - Phill: We'd need to get there quickly as they would probably start defending the border to stop millions of refugees from England
08/12/2018, 08:57 - Phill: Biggest nuclear weapon in US armoury is 1.2Mt
08/12/2018, 08:58 - Phill: So 40 times smaller than the Tsar Bomba
08/12/2018, 08:59 - Rob;: Total shit
08/12/2018, 08:59 - Phill: Think they disassembled all of the big weapons after the cold war
08/12/2018, 08:59 - Rob;: How much of a tiny fork is Trident?
08/12/2018, 09:00 - Phill: Trident 2 D5 missile is ~450Kt
08/12/2018, 09:01 - Phill: >not even having a 1Mt
08/12/2018, 09:01 - Rob;: You'll barely feel it
08/12/2018, 09:03 - Phill: It's more tactical these days. More, smaller weapons
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: That you can drop on specific targets
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: We'd get fucked Russia anyway.
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: They have about 7000 warheads
08/12/2018, 09:04 - Phill: We've got 200
08/12/2018, 09:05 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/12/2018, 09:06 - Phill: Drop trident on Shoreditch
08/12/2018, 09:09 - Rob;: Well yeah it completely fucks all of central London, kills 600,000 people. Perhaps they should target major cities instead of small Welsh towns

08/12/2018, 12:45 - David;: Americans are so unaware of Wales. They don't get close to it.
08/12/2018, 12:46 - David;: Look at you as if you've gone mental when you mention it. The idea of England not being coextensive with the uk is baffling to them.
08/12/2018, 12:52 - Rob;: An appreciable number of them must be of Welsh decent
08/12/2018, 12:54 - Rob;: More Jones in America than anywhere else - 2.7 million
08/12/2018, 17:22 - Damian Rumble: On the topic of Wales. This is a conversation my kiwi house mate and I just had... 

Kiwi - "what's the weather like is Essex? You went to uni there right?" 
Me - "umm... We are basically in Essex here. You mean Exeter. It's alright"
Kiwi - "ah Exeter. That's in Wales right"
Me - "urgh no"
Kiwi - "ah ok. Wales is a great place. I had a great time when I visited the lake District"
Me - "the lake District is not in Wales.its no where near it mate"
Kiwi - "ok well fuck it"

09/12/2018, 18:18 - Phill: Why were Japan in cahoots with Nazi Germany?
09/12/2018, 18:21 - Rob;: Because of Japan's opposition to the society union
09/12/2018, 18:21 - Rob;: *soviet
09/12/2018, 18:22 - Phill: But they're fine with Nazis?

09/12/2018, 18:24 - Rob;: Every player in ww2 was pretty bad tbh
09/12/2018, 18:34 - Stefan;: The Japanese were pretty keen on their own racial supremacy and domination of lesser races
09/12/2018, 18:34 - Stefan;: I guess they just agreed to disagree with the Nazis about who was number one
09/12/2018, 18:57 - Phill: Maximum froust enabled

09/12/2018, 18:58 - Rob;: Motd  from yesterday on
09/12/2018, 18:58 - Rob;: Word from Theresa May's spokesman, via my housemate who he's friends with, is that tomorrow's vote on the Brexit deal is off because they know they don't have the numbers
09/12/2018, 18:59 - Rob;: How they'd delay it on the day I have no ide
09/12/2018, 18:59 - Stefan;: I was thinking she'd do this. But I don't see how delaying it will win over the 100 or so Tory MPs who are against it
09/12/2018, 19:00 - Rob;: No, unless it's just to sail closer to the wind and make the prospect of no deal more real and more terrifying
09/12/2018, 19:19 - Phill: Just dipped pate into the camembert. The richest thing over ever eaten.
09/12/2018, 19:47 - Damian Rumble: Very embarrassing... And hard to see how this changes anything at all...
09/12/2018, 22:32 - David;: Pretty sure their alliance pre-dated the end of the ribbentrop-molotov pact. Wasnt it more to do with ideological allignment/both being massive racists?
09/12/2018, 22:38 - Rob;: You'd know it better than me I'm sure, but I think Japan's initial approach to join the Axis agreement was based on wanting to secure an anti-communist alliance
09/12/2018, 22:40 - Rob;: At least as a pretence
09/12/2018, 22:41 - Rob;: <Media omitted>

10/12/2018, 08:30 - Jack G;: Looks like no deal is off the menu Phil https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-46481643
10/12/2018, 08:37 - Phill: They wouldn't pull the plug on Brexit. No deal will happen .
10/12/2018, 08:38 - Jack G;: There’s no appetite in parliament for no deal. If it comes down to no deal vs. No brexit they’ll cancel

10/12/2018, 09:15 - Damian Rumble: Difficult to see an MP from a remain constituency voting to revoke brexit...
10/12/2018, 09:17 - Jack G;: There’s a large majority in parliament against no deal - probably the only thing there’s is a majority for. If no deal looks like it’s becoming inevitable, I bet they’ll be moves made against it and this ECJ ruling makes that very easy
10/12/2018, 09:18 - Phill: Yeah they would probably change something but no deal is far more likely than no Brexit
10/12/2018, 09:19 - Phill: You think no deal would be a disaster? There would probably be a civil war if they just went "actually we just cancel this."
10/12/2018, 09:20 - Jack G;: Problem is we’ve fucked ourselves with a 2 year deadline so renegotiations aren’t ideal
10/12/2018, 09:21 - / James Ball: I think no deal is unlikely but I also think it unlikely that they will cancel brexit
10/12/2018, 09:22 - / James Ball: I think if there was a no deal situation there will probably be a GE and the timescale extended
10/12/2018, 09:24 - Jack G;: No deal would be shit, we’d have to suspend border checks on goods and make emergency agreements for stuff like medicines, food etc. We’ve done fuck all prep for it.
10/12/2018, 09:26 - Jack G;: Smuggling would make a big come back
10/12/2018, 09:26 - Sam;: Finally
10/12/2018, 09:26 - / James Ball: The precedent for a dead locked parliament however is to make changes and vote again (within parliament) not to hold another referendum
10/12/2018, 09:27 - / James Ball: Longing for smuggling
10/12/2018, 09:27 - Sam;: I need bootleggers
10/12/2018, 09:28 - Phill: Camambert and other region controllè foodstuffs would have insane street values
10/12/2018, 09:29 - / James Ball: 🥾🦵🏿
10/12/2018, 09:31 - Damian Rumble: This is Phil's long term plan. Stock pile fine French and Spanish wines. Then make a killing in a no deal scenario. Suddenly three years of trolling makes sense....
10/12/2018, 09:31 - / James Ball: I think the leave side hinting at public disorder is pretty extreme though. 17.4 v 16.1 v 13 milliom and those numbers have shifted from natural wastage anyway by now

10/12/2018, 12:18 - Jack G;: This is a move to stay in power. Her deal is dead, a few extra days isn’t going to fix it. She needs to go

10/12/2018, 12:40 - Phill: Wow. Down less than 1%
10/12/2018, 13:03 - Jack G;: Apparently MPs need to vote on a business motion - which will be tabled later - to pull the vote on the deal, so could still be on

12/12/2018, 12:50 - Sam;: Looked like children. Trump still pushing for the wall
12/12/2018, 12:58 - Damian Rumble: "The chances of her actually losing, based on my sounding this morning, are slim. But maybe 120 to 130 MPs will vote to get rid of her – and were that to happen, she would be severely weakened, and could yet decide to resign, even though she would not have lost in a formal sense.

If the vote against her was 100 or less, arguably she would emerge stronger than she is perceived to be right now. " - Robert Peston

18/12/2018, 10:07 - Sam;: I do feel lighter now..
18/12/2018, 10:08 - Sam;: ..but did just have a massive shot..
18/12/2018, 10:08 - Sam;: Shit
18/12/2018, 10:09 - Jack G;: A celebratory shit
18/12/2018, 10:09 - Rob;: Is it like taking off a horcrux, Sam?
18/12/2018, 10:09 - Rob;: All the hate flowing away
18/12/2018, 10:12 - Sam;: Yeah, a piece of me has died but it needed to
18/12/2018, 11:04 - David;: Norinho
18/12/2018, 11:05 - Rob;: Who will take him now?
18/12/2018, 11:05 - David;: He's over, damaged goods
18/12/2018, 11:15 - Rob;: A specialist in failure
18/12/2018, 11:15 - David;: Could go back to Madrid as they are shit now anyway? Has the reputation there still
18/12/2018, 11:16 - David;: If they just feel Ramos et al need shouting at autistically for a bit
18/12/2018, 11:16 - Rob;: Perhaps. The longevity there is so low anyway I suppose his standard 2.5 year trajectory wouldn't be a problem
18/12/2018, 11:24 - David;: Must be Zidane now?
18/12/2018, 11:45 - David;: Sacking him costs them £18m. That's a nice little detail.
18/12/2018, 11:49 - Jack G;: Another nice fact - David Moyes’ initial contract still has 5 months to run
18/12/2018, 11:50 - David;: 💩
18/12/2018, 11:53 - Phill: >tfw when Fergusons win percentage was 59.67 and Mourinhos was 58.33
18/12/2018, 11:53 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/12/2018, 11:55 - David;: That's mental - i guess Ferguson had some shot season ls at the beggining before they got dominant?
18/12/2018, 11:56 - David;: And the duff period in early 2000s
18/12/2018, 11:57 - Rob;: Also some of the winning points totals in late 90s early 2000 were really low compared to now
18/12/2018, 11:57 - Rob;: Football is harder now
18/12/2018, 12:08 - Phill: So Mourinhos percentage is better?
18/12/2018, 12:11 - David;: No, because the top teams all get more points  and need more to win
18/12/2018, 12:11 - David;: So you'd expect him to get more.
18/12/2018, 12:13 - Damian Rumble: Put Mourinho in the bin
18/12/2018, 12:13 - Rob;: Yeah, it just explains why Ferguson's isn't much better - he didn't need to be
18/12/2018, 12:13 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
18/12/2018, 12:13 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
18/12/2018, 12:15 - Jack G;: The mid table teams are all much better these days with all the tv money so kind of odd how to top teams are all getting more points than historically
18/12/2018, 12:23 - David;: Hmm looking at that i'd say it's actually pretty consistent apart from the 3 years 96-99.
18/12/2018, 12:23 - David;: And man city last season
18/12/2018, 12:23 - Phill: What are you two on about? In a era where the standard is higher, Moi's percentage looks good compared to Fergusons
18/12/2018, 12:25 - David;: No, because it suggests league is less competitive. I.e. big clubs are more dominant over smaller clubs, so it's easier to get more points. But you also need to to win titles.
18/12/2018, 12:25 - Jack G;: Mou trending downwards though, Ferguson is over a much larger sample size
18/12/2018, 12:27 - Phill: The league may be less competitive, but the quality throughout the league is better compared to Fergusons era
18/12/2018, 12:27 - David;: Yes, but relative quality of top clubs vs bottom half has widened
18/12/2018, 12:28 - David;: While general standard has improved throughout
18/12/2018, 12:28 - Phill: Still don't understand how it's easier to win games in an era where the standard of the league has improved
18/12/2018, 12:29 - Phill: Doesn't make sense
18/12/2018, 12:29 - Phill: Either way. >MOU
18/12/2018, 12:33 - Sam;: Anything to try and tarnish Ferguson. Standard United bashing
18/12/2018, 12:34 - Rob;: Was just saying that 5 of the 7 lowest scoring premierleague wins were by Ferguson, which might  contribute to how he achieved so much with a win % very similar to Mourinho, who got 4th, 5th and 2nd
18/12/2018, 12:36 - Sam;: mourinho got 6th then 2nd.
18/12/2018, 12:37 - Sam;: need to compare win rate in each season, but even then in needs analysis relative performance to other clubs each season.
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Rob;: We can all agree Mourinho is shit though
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Sam;: each season the quality of the league changes and so does the relative quality between teams
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Sam;: nah
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Jack G;: I bet Ferguson has sleepless nights about his win percentage. Not like he has a huge trophy cabinet to cheer himself up with
18/12/2018, 12:38 - Sam;: still won more than klopp, poch and wenger combined
18/12/2018, 12:43 - Sam;: mourinho's PL win % was 53.8. Fergie 65.1
18/12/2018, 12:44 - Rob;: Ah that explains it
18/12/2018, 12:45 - Rob;: Won two cups in 2.4 seasons?
18/12/2018, 12:45 - Rob;: Plus a final
18/12/2018, 12:54 - Sam;: 3
18/12/2018, 12:55 - Sam;: Laurent blanc = larry white
18/12/2018, 13:04 - Rob;: The community shield does not count
18/12/2018, 13:23 - Sam;: https://www.instagram.com/p/Brh3A9ZnIwQ/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&igshid=d2d5nsmtmgbt
18/12/2018, 14:40 - David;: How is it Fergie bashing? It's making the point he operated in a different era which could explain the win percentage. It's Mourinho bashing not Fergie bashing.
18/12/2018, 14:41 - Sam;: trying to diminish his trophies saying they were 'easier' to win. ridiculous
18/12/2018, 14:42 - David;: It's not saying that - completely missing the point.
18/12/2018, 14:43 - Sam;: >"Yeah, it just explains why Ferguson's isn't much better - he didn't need to be"
18/12/2018, 14:45 - David;: a) Rob's words not mine. b) point is that in an era when big clubs have less relative spending power (i.e. pre-globalization of football) then on average the big clubs drop more points. But all the big clubs are doing this so it's no easier to win titles.
18/12/2018, 14:46 - Rob;: Yeah I'm bashing Fergie, was trying to work out how their win ratios were almost identical and thought the trend towards higher point scores recently bought have explained it
18/12/2018, 14:47 - David;: Likewise now, big clubs have huge revenues/foreign owners, so tend to beat small teams more consistently. But again, many of the big clubs are like this so you have to compete with that.
18/12/2018, 14:47 - Rob;: Haha * not * bashing fergie
18/12/2018, 14:47 - Rob;: But the difference between cup and league win ratios more than explains it
18/12/2018, 14:54 - Sam;: It’s was sub conscious fergie bashing. Your natural underlying anti united bias coming out first
18/12/2018, 14:55 - David;: I mean he was a cunt.
18/12/2018, 14:58 - Rob;: I'm sorry I hurt your feelings
18/12/2018, 15:00 - Sam;: wouldn't expect any better from those who look to tear down the greatest manager in the history of the game, any chance they get.
18/12/2018, 15:06 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/12/2018, 15:07 - David;: Victim complex
18/12/2018, 15:07 - David;: Small club mentality
18/12/2018, 15:07 - Jack G;: Straight out of the Mourinho playbook
18/12/2018, 15:22 - Sam;: Fuming

18/12/2018, 21:01 - David;: Nah, got it from scraping my facebook data before deactivating my account.
18/12/2018, 21:01 - David;: The nano is still the holy grail. I believe there will be gems on there when/if I find it again.
18/12/2018, 21:02 - David;: What was that big argument we had in wales where someone climed to have filmed something on a nokia?
18/12/2018, 21:03 - David;: *claimed

18/12/2018, 21:04 - David;: Spicy rice
18/12/2018, 21:04 - Rob;: There's a video from a different angle of the Philaroo night that was taken on a different phone
18/12/2018, 21:04 - Rob;: But it's been lost
18/12/2018, 21:05 - Rob;: That's from 6th form or just after I think
18/12/2018, 21:13 - Phill: Not sure what's worse, being sexually assaulted with a cucumber or me calling you all a racial slur. Not our finest hour.
18/12/2018, 21:13 - Rob;: Yeah I can see why it was never uploaded to Facebook
18/12/2018, 21:14 - Phill: M-me-me too

18/12/2018, 21:23 - Rob;: There was that huge summer that had night of the long knives, crystalnacht and Bloody Sunday
18/12/2018, 21:24 - Phill: Just remembered that random girl that was there for a mad one at pauls. One night. never seen again. She saw enough.
18/12/2018, 21:25 - Rob;: A later great big night was that new year at Paul's where MDMA was first circled around. My memory cuts to us all in circle, rubbing each others' hair, saying something like '14 years! Friends for so long'
18/12/2018, 21:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Fast forward 6 years and you have Sam shitting himself In the elsan
18/12/2018, 21:26 - Rob;: Yeah yeah yeah, but it feels like an emotionally shared moment
18/12/2018, 21:27 - Phill: Shit we will have known each other for coming up 20 years soon
18/12/2018, 21:27 - Rob;: He shat for all of us

18/12/2018, 21:28 - Rob;: Stefan and I were saying this while shitting our guys out high on LSD - we're actually eachother's oldest friends, despite the shaky start where Zach replaced Stefan with me
18/12/2018, 21:29 - Rob;: shitting our *guts* out. No guys.
18/12/2018, 21:29 - Hamish Sinclair: So glad that's cleared up

18/12/2018, 23:18 - David;: Ah yeah. I remember watching a lot of the emirates cup through all of that. So starved of football.

19/12/2018, 11:59 - Rob;: Yeah definitely a consideration. Hard to market cunthood
19/12/2018, 12:00 - Rob;: But not really making money
19/12/2018, 12:00 - Rob;: More repairing some of the damage he'd done
19/12/2018, 17:34 - David;: Yeah also you don't 'make money' on a share price rise unless you sell stock buy-backs or use it to value secondary offerings.
19/12/2018, 17:35 - David;: They haven't made £170m of revenue that's just what their market cap has increased by
19/12/2018, 17:36 - Sam;: Oh really? Could you also tell us how to suck eggs pls? Asking for granny..
19/12/2018, 17:38 - David;: Well you linked the article. Don't link what you know to be raw shite
19/12/2018, 17:38 - Sam;: It’s just a title
19/12/2018, 17:38 - David;: If you claim not to know egg sucking i'm justified in providing a tutorial
19/12/2018, 17:39 - Sam;: I was obviously pointing to the stock banter. Not revenue
19/12/2018, 17:40 - David;: ""They've probably made money by sacking him," he added." - Sam Thornton on his granny's lack of egg sucking nous

27/12/2018, 13:08 - Rob;: Football is popular precisely because it can't be boiled down into numbers
27/12/2018, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: If you actually went and read the methodology behind how the predictions were produced you'll find an interesting discussion about how they factored in random variation, form, home-away, importance, etc into the model.
27/12/2018, 13:11 - Phill: Like you damo, I build models every day. And deep down, you know that you can't model football.
27/12/2018, 13:17 - Hamish Sinclair: There's no way they can factor in important random events, an injury to a van dijk, a failed drugs test, a pedo Adam Johnston for example
27/12/2018, 13:19 - David;: The problem is they have to ascribe two very significant variables - managerial tactics and psychology - to 'random variation'. But they're not random, they can be analysed qualitatively but not by looking at historical time series. So the most important aspects of football analysis it has to bracket out of its model.
27/12/2018, 13:30 - Sam;: Go fuck your self San Diego

2.Market the site on social media as a Robyn hood charity platform where 98% of the referral commission goes to a charity of their choice
27/12/2018, 22:08 - Paul Dickinson: So you’re actually the anti Robin Hood
27/12/2018, 22:09 - Phill: 3. Develop the platform as an ethical, redirection of wealth capitalist loophole
27/12/2018, 22:09 - Phill: 4. Keep the 2%
27/12/2018, 22:09 - Phill: 5. Profit
27/12/2018, 22:10 - Paul Dickinson: Surely call it earnings and then use it as a way of writing off tax via charitable giving. Scheme. Worth more than 2% that way?
27/12/2018, 22:10 - Paul Dickinson: And charity gets full amount. But you just classify it as your earnings and your charitable or syndicates charitable giving
27/12/2018, 22:10 - Phill: Get it in bread

29/12/2018, 13:11 - Hamish Sinclair: The size of the insulin spike is very important aswell, having 3 big car heavy meals causes big spikes in insulin which tends to be worse
29/12/2018, 13:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Lots of small, low GI index foods throughout the day keeps things pretty stable
29/12/2018, 13:19 - David;: Yeah - she also has a low-carbs caveat. She basically seems to be saying have decent sized protein and veg-heavy meaks and leave a long fasting period between dinner and breakfast.

16/01/2019, 11:27 - Phill: Favourite but yesterday was when BERCOW just shouted "UNLOCKKKK"
16/01/2019, 11:29 - David;: I like it when he bellowed 'My role is not to be a cheerleader for the executive branch!'
16/01/2019, 12:07 - Sam;: I’m a big fan of ‘DIVISION!’ during a vote.
16/01/2019, 12:15 - Sam;: I like the way pmqs can lurch from the big issues straight to the serious minerals project
16/01/2019, 12:18 - David;: They had a debate this morning about the height of letterboxes and banning overly low ones.
16/01/2019, 12:18 - David;: Had to get that in there before the no confidence motion on the PM
16/01/2019, 12:18 - Sam;: >overly low
16/01/2019, 12:18 - Sam;: Excessive lowness
16/01/2019, 12:19 - David;: Too low?
16/01/2019, 12:19 - Sam;: Yeah
16/01/2019, 12:19 - David;: Yeah. Problem for postmen's backs you see.
16/01/2019, 12:19 - Sam;: Vital to debate that though
16/01/2019, 12:20 - Sam;: Why does that get to parliament. Is there not an obscure committee it can go to?
16/01/2019, 12:21 - David;: It's a law change, would require primary legislation.
16/01/2019, 12:21 - David;: Brexit can wait
16/01/2019, 12:22 - David;: Do you want to put the EU before the backs of our British postmen?

16/01/2019, 13:57 - Hamish Sinclair: "One of the most remarkable, and indeed excruciating, things about May has been her insistence on governing like she’s got a landslide majority. Why has no one told her...
Never has the intervention of a candid best mate been more needed. At some point in July 2017, surely Amber Rudd or whoever should have gone round and given May “The Talk”. Along the lines of: “Babe, true friends tell you the truth, amirite? Because if no one else is going to say this, then I will: the referendum vote was problematically close anyway, and then you totally spaffed your majority. Like, you literally have no majority. So … "

16/01/2019, 16:31 - Rob;: If the population ever plummets then can have *Crashing boars* as a headline
16/01/2019, 16:32 - Rob;: They can have that on me

16/01/2019, 17:31 - Phill: Transcribed the whole Lose yourself Vs Brexit lyrics on the train home
16/01/2019, 17:32 - Phill: Look
If you had
One shot
Or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted
In one moment
Would you capture it
Or just let it slip?
Yo
Her palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on her sweater already, Phillip's spaghetti
She's nervous, but on the surface she looks calm and ready
To drop amendments, but she keeps on forgettin'

She get vote down, the whole house gets so loud, she opens her mouth but her MPs won't come out. She's chokin now, everybody's joking now. The clocks run out, times up, cliff edge, blaow!

Snap back to reality, where's my nationality?
Oh, there goes Rees-Mogg, he choked
He's so mad, but he won't give up that easy? No
He won't have it, he knows the whole backstory
It don't matter, he's dope, he knows that, but he's broke
He's so stacked that he knows, when he goes back to his ERG, that's when its
Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
He better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him

You better lose yourself in the Brexit, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime you better
You better lose yourself in the Brexit, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow

Confidence escaping, through this hole that is gaping, the house is mine for the taking, 
make Boris king, as we move towards a new world order, An EU life is boring and it's close to post mortem.  
It only grows harder, only grows hotter
She blows us all over these MP's is all on her
Coast to coast negotiations, she's known as the globetrotter
Lonely roads, God only knows, her  own cabinet
She goes home and barely knows her own ministers
But hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water
Her back benchers don't want her no mo, she's cold product
The 1922 committee moved on to the next schmo who flows, she nose dove and sold nada
So the soap opera is told and unfolds, I suppose it's old partna, but the beat goes on da da dum da dum da da. 

No more games, I'm a change what you call democracy, tear this mother fuckin single market up like two dogs raged, I was playing in the beginning, the moods all changed, May's been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage.
But I kept rhymin' and stepwritin' the next exit deal,
Best believe somebody's payin' 

All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my withdrawal agreement and I can't provide the right type of
Life for my Party 'cause man, these God damn back stops don't buy diapers
And its no movie, there's no free trade deal
This is my life and these times are so hard
And it's getting even harder tryin' to feed and water my constituents, plus
See dishonor caught up between bein' prime minister and a remainer
Jeremy screamin' on and too much
But I've got to stay in one spot, another vote of no confidence or not
Juncker's gotten me to the point, I'm like a snail I've got
To formulate a plot 'fore I end up in the EEA or shot,
Cross-party talks is my only motherfuckin' option, failures not
Europe, I love you, but we've got to go, I cannot go back on the referendums lot
So here I go is my shot
Feet fail me not 'cause maybe the only opportunity that I got
You better lose yourself in the Brexit, the moment
You own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime

16/01/2019, 17:50 - David;: Suggested improvements: 'to sieze every Brexit you ever wanted'; 'May's palms are sweaty'; 'gets vote down' (vs get); 'back's to these ropes' (right?) 'when he goes back to his country home, that's when it's back to the ERG' 'Lose yourself in the Brexit, the no deal...'; 'and EU life is boring, but article 50's close to post mortem' 'She blows us all over and Gove is all on her...' 'payin the divorce settlement' 'Cross-party talks is my only motherfuckin option, a people's vote's not'.

16/01/2019, 20:09 - Damian Rumble: So let me get this straight... The government has twice tried and failed to get it's flagship policy passed and has failed each time because MPs don't support the policy. However, brexiteers and labour have now twice tried the prime minister and the government and have twice failed because MPs broadly support the government. Soooo.. what now?

19/01/2019, 14:24 - David;: On 22 points already
19/01/2019, 14:24 - Phill: >22 points meaning shit when you're rock bottom of the league
19/01/2019, 14:25 - David;: Still dat gameweek rank
19/01/2019, 14:26 - David;: Always something to play for. Professional pride if nothing else
19/01/2019, 14:26 - David;: Put yourself in the shop window
19/01/2019, 14:27 - David;: The badge. The shirt
19/01/2019, 14:27 - Rob;: My fanbase (me) is in turmoil. Furious at the owner (me) for not backing the manager (me)
19/01/2019, 14:27 - Rob;: Next year
19/01/2019, 14:28 - David;: Are you blaming underinvestment in the squad? Or millennial players who think they are bigger than the club
19/01/2019, 14:28 - Rob;: It's been a mix of everything
19/01/2019, 14:28 - Rob;: Has anyone watched the Sunderland Netflix documentary?
19/01/2019, 14:28 - Rob;: It's so big
19/01/2019, 14:29 - David;: Not yet
19/01/2019, 14:29 - Rob;: Jack Rodwell the pariah
19/01/2019, 14:29 - Rob;: You have to
19/01/2019, 14:29 - David;: Great, can slide into that now
19/01/2019, 14:29 - Rob;: It's quite broad, not a lot on tactics etc, but you get to see a lot of how a club runs
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: It's great that the purpose of season one was to chart their glorious rise back to the prem
19/01/2019, 14:30 - David;: Lol
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: It's like the producers went
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Rob;: Yeah quite fun seeing their early optimism, but knowing what happens
19/01/2019, 14:30 - David;: But the old double relegation
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: "which club is most likely to come back up"
19/01/2019, 14:30 - Phill: But then double relegation
19/01/2019, 14:31 - Phill: Which actually makes for more gripping TV
19/01/2019, 14:31 - Rob;: I love the slightly too well groomed CEO and his little espressos
19/01/2019, 14:31 - David;: Lol already great
19/01/2019, 14:31 - Rob;: Professionally polishing turds for the fanbase
19/01/2019, 14:31 - David;: Praying for the team
19/01/2019, 14:34 - Phill: Lee Cattermole bawling is a highlight
19/01/2019, 14:34 - Phill: Saying he got abuse in the street after they went down again
19/01/2019, 14:35 - Phill: "it's difficult to take"
19/01/2019, 14:58 - David;: Ah yeah the CEO guy is very Brent
19/01/2019, 16:41 - Rob;: Lord Palmerston can be Sir Cliff
19/01/2019, 16:49 - Damian Rumble: That feeling when you commit your wildcard to getting Salah in and he immediately repays you with a couple of goals...
19/01/2019, 16:53 - David;: Did you enjoy spending the 0.5m premium?
19/01/2019, 17:36 - David;: Feel like Rwanda have more pressing things to spend money on than a premier league arm band sponsorship
19/01/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: They got a lot of stick for it
19/01/2019, 17:45 - Rob;: The president even came out and defended it
19/01/2019, 17:45 - David;: Ha
19/01/2019, 17:46 - David;: I mean obviously tourism revenue is meant to pay for it. But seems a very costly and indirect route to that
19/01/2019, 17:46 - David;: Via the arsenal fan base
19/01/2019, 17:46 - Rob;: We may have been quite open to it
19/01/2019, 17:46 - Rob;: Africa is very much our commercial market
19/01/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: What's a little ethnic cleansing among friends?
19/01/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: I hear there's an excellent Hotel Rwanda
19/01/2019, 17:49 - David;: The only thing unifying the hutus and the tutsi's was their insistence that Wenger must go.
19/01/2019, 18:10 - Hamish Sinclair: That shoulder
19/01/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
19/01/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Sublime overhead kick? MISS
19/01/2019, 18:11 - Rob;: Accidental shoulder in the wrong direction? GOAL KLAXON
19/01/2019, 18:17 - David;: 50 goals a season, all with the perennium
19/01/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: Teh overhead perineum
19/01/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: Even penalties?
19/01/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: Dat run-up
19/01/2019, 18:25 - David;: Slides backwards into it. Amazing technique
19/01/2019, 18:25 - David;: So is Ozil dead to Emery?
19/01/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Hard to say. Emery is fairly inscrutable. It's either him attempting to discipline Ozil into being a more comitted, consistent player, or yeah, he's made up his mind that we can do without him
19/01/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Either way I can see him being moved on
19/01/2019, 18:34 - David;: Not sure who would pay his wages though
19/01/2019, 18:44 - Rob;: Yeah that may be a problem
19/01/2019, 18:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Really good segment in Thursday's football weekly about emery ozil
19/01/2019, 18:45 - Hamish Sinclair: They reckoned ozil is getting some of the fallout from his relationship with neymar at psg
19/01/2019, 18:46 - David;: Makes sense
19/01/2019, 18:46 - David;: So he hates the premadonna playmaker who won't press?
19/01/2019, 18:47 - Rob;: Think that makes sense too
19/01/2019, 18:47 - Phill: Don't get why people froth about Ozil not defending
19/01/2019, 18:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, but also having essentially lost his battle against neymar, he needs to prove he isn't weak in dealing with big player
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Needs to desperately prove he has the bigg3st swinging dick
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Phill: He's one of the best creative players in the world, who gives a fuck if he defends?
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Rob;: I don't think internally his defending is an issue, just consistency
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Gives the ball away a lot doesn't he?
19/01/2019, 18:48 - Phill: Yeah but the reason he's not consistent is because he's expected to defend and shit
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: I don't think that's true
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: He's had a free role his entire career at Arsenal
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Phill: "ooh mesut, get back you cunt, I don't care if it pulls you out of your best position which is to receive the ball in midfield after a breakdown and drive forwards"
19/01/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Literally no one is saying that
19/01/2019, 18:50 - David;: No but high pressing
19/01/2019, 18:51 - David;: I don't think it's that he doesn't cover ground but not good at actually winning balls back. The art of pressing to force a turnover
19/01/2019, 18:51 - Phill: https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/11670/11475371/unai-emery-warns-mesut-ozil-every-player-must-defend-for-arsenal
19/01/2019, 18:52 - Hamish Sinclair: I know that teams, Liverpool for example have targeted him as he's weak in the tackle and prone to giving the ball away
19/01/2019, 18:52 - David;: Yeah, I think it's more that than 'lazy' as such
19/01/2019, 18:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Brendan Rodgers is on record as saying they targeted him in that 5:1 several years ago
19/01/2019, 18:52 - Phill: Ozil's best, most effective position, is to receive the ball, once a more defensive teammate has won the ball  and drive forwards
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Wouldn't work at Liverpool
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Would work at United
19/01/2019, 18:53 - David;: No, antithesis of a klopp player
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: And that's where he's always played for us
19/01/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Your manager has repeatedly said he needs to defend
19/01/2019, 18:54 - Phill: It's the same with Ramsey. Why is he being allowed to leave?
19/01/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: What's the same with him?
19/01/2019, 18:54 - Phill: Emery's/Arsenal's player management is garbage
19/01/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: The contract situations definitely are
19/01/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: I guess we'll see next season who Emery would actually like to play creative midfield. Would expect a signing
19/01/2019, 18:55 - Phill: Do you feel Emery is hamstrung by the failings of the board?
19/01/2019, 18:56 - David;: I feel you have a decently balanced squad
19/01/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Definitely not being very good on contracts the last 5 years or so
19/01/2019, 18:56 - David;: But not a clear identity
19/01/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Apart from defence, we need some quality it the middle to replace Koscielny now he's old
19/01/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: But mostly it's fine
19/01/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: A summer transfer window should hopefully help
19/01/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/Football_LDN/status/1086709509635100673?s=19
19/01/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: The nutcracker suite
19/01/2019, 23:10 - David;: Solskjaer - the garden gnome
19/01/2019, 23:16 - Rob;: That Cardiff player doesn't know how to take a point blank ball to the bonce
19/01/2019, 23:18 - David;: You know. Should have a word
19/01/2019, 23:20 - Rob;: Would love it if that was a huge skill that compensated for everything else
19/01/2019, 23:21 - Rob;: Like Roary Delap only being good at throwing
19/01/2019, 23:21 - Rob;: I'd get subbed on for the last 10 mins just to Jake a bonce blow
19/01/2019, 23:30 - David;: Bonce blow for toon
20/01/2019, 12:54 - David;: When did Wagner get sacked? Missed that
20/01/2019, 12:54 - David;: Hoping for the bounce
20/01/2019, 12:54 - Sam;: He left. Burnt out
20/01/2019, 12:54 - David;: Resigned? You don't see that these days
20/01/2019, 12:55 - Sam;: Yeah. Just couldn’t do it anymore
20/01/2019, 12:57 - David;: Can you have a bounce before the new manager comes in?
20/01/2019, 12:57 - Rob;: Can the bounce exist if it wasn't a sacking?
20/01/2019, 12:58 - David;: Yeah yeah, you always get a bounce
20/01/2019, 12:58 - David;: A free one
20/01/2019, 12:58 - Rob;: Like the elder wand not working if it's last owner wasn't overcome
20/01/2019, 17:24 - David;: Ah. So Sunderland till I die. Deliberate policy of buying players with an injury record
20/01/2019, 17:24 - David;: Going to end well
20/01/2019, 17:27 - David;: Also they've got the parachute payments and huge stadium but seem to be operating on a shoestring
20/01/2019, 18:11 - David;: Them throwing away the 3-1 lead at Brentford is a highlight
20/01/2019, 23:15 - David;: Rodwell seems a real cunt
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: Got this spam work email this morning selling reinforced doors
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: This is their advertising angle
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: Powerful stuff
21/01/2019, 09:54 - Phill: <Media omitted>
21/01/2019, 10:08 - Sam;: That inferno. So chill. No panic, door is reinforced 👌🏻👍🏻
21/01/2019, 10:21 - Rob;: Dead of night outside
21/01/2019, 10:21 - Rob;: No worries
21/01/2019, 10:21 - Rob;: Time to draw
21/01/2019, 11:09 - / James Ball: Also, they appear to be windows, not doors. The advertising team fell at the first hurdle.

21/01/2019, 16:45 - Hamish Sinclair: What was decided for this weekend?
21/01/2019, 16:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Where are we going? Dave?
21/01/2019, 16:46 - Hamish Sinclair: And are people bringing other halves? Or will we mostly be shitting and looking at tits?
21/01/2019, 16:52 - / James Ball: I second Hamish. I'm on the dry January but I'm up for an old school froust if one's occurring
21/01/2019, 16:52 - Phill: Becca is coming, she's keen on the froust
21/01/2019, 16:52 - Phill: She's desensitised to it now
21/01/2019, 16:55 - Rob;: Julia's coming, probably just for the party and after, not the pre-froust
21/01/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: I can either get a taxi back to my parents with her and maybe Calum, or all of us back to Casa Yarrow
21/01/2019, 16:57 - Sam;: On Saturday night, are you up lot up for a Chinese at mine before heading out?
21/01/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Would be good
21/01/2019, 16:57 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
21/01/2019, 16:58 - Sam;: Lol, the split chin
21/01/2019, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
21/01/2019, 16:58 - Phill: Need to think about getting some taxis in bread
21/01/2019, 16:58 - Phill: Those faces are very morrowind
21/01/2019, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
21/01/2019, 17:08 - / James Ball: So what is the plan? Meet at chez Yarrow and then head to Banbury for Chinese and Sam's birthday on Saturday then Sunday froust at Dave's?
21/01/2019, 17:08 - Phill: Need to get back to Dave's on Saturday night
21/01/2019, 17:08 - Phill: So will need to book taxis
21/01/2019, 17:09 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah walk it mate, it's only 20mins down the road...
21/01/2019, 17:10 - Phill: 🖕
21/01/2019, 17:11 - Phill: There's a >bus from chippy to Banbury Saturday evening at either 5 or 6 pm
21/01/2019, 17:14 - David;: Yeah so my house is free all weekend, I'm thinking convene in chippy Saturday morning, get the bus over to banners for the evening and split a taxi back.
21/01/2019, 17:15 - David;: Judith requests duvet covers so she doesn't have to wash stuff. Plenty of beds.
21/01/2019, 17:16 - Phill: We will bring our own duvet and pillows, shotgun a bed!
21/01/2019, 17:17 - Phill: Who's going to book cabs? Anyone know any good ones?
21/01/2019, 17:17 - David;: Yeah, well there's 4 doubles plus a single room and assorted mattresses
21/01/2019, 17:17 - Phill: Bonus points for grotty old man banter
21/01/2019, 17:17 - David;: We're in bed surplus
21/01/2019, 17:18 - David;: Is Kate coming up Hamish?
21/01/2019, 17:18 - David;: Oh also can you bring my coat - left it at yours after the Liverpool game
21/01/2019, 17:20 - David;: https://www.007carsbanbury.co.uk/
21/01/2019, 17:20 - David;: Ridiculously good website for a local taxi company lol
21/01/2019, 17:27 - David;: How many will we be for the taxi? Might have to get 2
21/01/2019, 17:30 - Paul;: 🙋🏻‍♂
21/01/2019, 17:31 - Phill: Becca and Me
21/01/2019, 17:32 - David;: So: Me, Paul, James, Phil and Becca, Hamish and Kate. That would be 7. Then if Rob, Julia and Callum want to head back as well 10?
21/01/2019, 17:33 - David;: Is that everyone?
21/01/2019, 17:35 - David;: Also what time - 1pm?
21/01/2019, 17:35 - David;: *am

21/01/2019, 17:41 - David;: That place was booked up for then
21/01/2019, 17:41 - Phill: Might be worth seeing if they have a minibus or something?
21/01/2019, 17:41 - David;: Going out, will look at some more later or you can google other companies.
21/01/2019, 17:42 - David;: http://acetaxisbanbury.co.uk/our-services/

22/01/2019, 19:24 - Phill: 👍

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-46967320
22/01/2019, 23:37 - David;: Sambo must have a dose of Q fever
23/01/2019, 08:25 - Phill: That feel when handing notice in today
23/01/2019, 08:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
23/01/2019, 08:26 - Rob;: Oh. Phil. Where tos you go now?
23/01/2019, 08:26 - Phill: Got a project management job at a construction company in Broadway
23/01/2019, 08:28 - Rob;: The Broadway with the tower?
23/01/2019, 08:28 - Sam;: Oh nice, that’s the broadway near moreton?
23/01/2019, 08:34 - Rob;: Hand it in on big letters like that CV
23/01/2019, 08:34 - Rob;: N O T I C E
23/01/2019, 08:36 - Rob;: Boss, dropping letters: 'why have you handed me the word ICETON in huge capitals?'
23/01/2019, 08:37 - Stefan;: Or give him a drawing of you handing your notice to him
23/01/2019, 08:39 - Phill: Yeah Broadway near the tower
23/01/2019, 09:56 - David;: Where in Banbury are we likely to want picking up from?
23/01/2019, 09:58 - Sam;: Say the top of Parson’s street. Short walk up from AKA. There’s a car park there that the guy can pull into in front of a pub called the white horse
23/01/2019, 10:04 - David;: Okay, booked one car which can cover 8 people
23/01/2019, 10:04 - David;: 30 quid

23/01/2019, 14:07 - David;: *saying that
23/01/2019, 14:08 - Sam;: Yeah there were a few murmurs at best there
23/01/2019, 14:10 - Phill: Oderr, oderr.
23/01/2019, 14:18 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
23/01/2019, 14:19 - Rob;: It's super effective
23/01/2019, 17:03 - Rob;: How did your boss take notice Phil?
23/01/2019, 17:04 - Rob;: Did he take notice?
23/01/2019, 17:04 - Phill: Loved it.
23/01/2019, 17:04 - Rob;: Happy to see the back of you?
23/01/2019, 17:04 - Phill: Nah everyone is really butthurt
23/01/2019, 17:04 - Rob;: Excellent
23/01/2019, 17:05 - Phill: He tried to offer me more money until I told him how much my new job was paying
23/01/2019, 17:06 - Phill: Then he was just like ah no
23/01/2019, 17:06 - Phill: Although the staff handbook says I might, if requested have to do a medical. So I'm off the weed for a bit
23/01/2019, 17:06 - Phill: ☹
23/01/2019, 17:07 - Phill: But I'm guessing that's more for old shit munchers who they think might need occupational health etc
23/01/2019, 17:08 - Rob;: Yeah surely
23/01/2019, 17:08 - Rob;: Would it necessarily even include a drugs test?
23/01/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: I had a great notice day at the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining. They were well butthurt cause it was only after 8 months. I explained I was off to an oscar-winning animation company, which was a bit of a dream, for more money too and they were just like 'but the Institute is VERY prestigious. We hope to have our own TV channel'. Fucked off to Blaen Y Cwm the next day. That feel.
23/01/2019, 17:10 - Rob;: We'd all watch a Materials, Minerals and Mining TV channel I'm sure
23/01/2019, 17:11 - Phill: I doubt it tbh. But better to not risk it.
23/01/2019, 17:12 - Phill: Once I've got a feel for it I'll be back honking I'm sure
23/01/2019, 17:13 - David;: Will buy any of that stuff from you if looking to offload
23/01/2019, 17:14 - David;: Take away the temptation.
23/01/2019, 17:21 - Phill: All gone unfortunately
23/01/2019, 17:22 - Phill: Been living off dregs the past few days too so good timing
23/01/2019, 17:36 - Sam;: Listening to how Southgate has ‘taken the weight out of the shirt’. Such a heavy shirt
23/01/2019, 17:39 - David;: 'Someone had been stitching iron into collars for years. That was the first thing I changed.'
23/01/2019, 21:54 - David;: Easy to forget about pears
23/01/2019, 21:54 - David;: Strong fruit
23/01/2019, 22:10 - Paul;: Shit tier fruit
23/01/2019, 22:11 - David;: Nah
23/01/2019, 22:12 - Sam;: Please illuminate us on the tiers  of fruit
23/01/2019, 22:13 - Paul;: God tier - apple, little orange ones
23/01/2019, 22:13 - Paul;: Great tier - pineapple, peach
23/01/2019, 22:14 - Paul;: Middle tier - large orange ones
23/01/2019, 22:14 - Paul;: Dump tier - banana
23/01/2019, 22:15 - Paul;: Shit tier - melon, pear
23/01/2019, 22:22 - David;: > 'orange ones'
23/01/2019, 22:23 - David;: So correct on melon, banana, pineapple, oranges. The apple sits astride them all as king. But peach can fuck off and pear is close to apple
23/01/2019, 22:23 - Sam;: Does that mean an orange or are you talking about a tangerine?
23/01/2019, 22:23 - Paul;: The varieties of orange citrus fruits but not necessarily an orange
23/01/2019, 22:23 - Sam;: Or a nectarine
23/01/2019, 22:23 - David;: Pear just has a less good PR department
23/01/2019, 22:24 - David;: I hope you're not limping the grapefruit in there because that would be inexcusable
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Melons are the biggest piece of shit
23/01/2019, 22:24 - David;: *lumping
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Grapes are high up
23/01/2019, 22:24 - David;: Yeah, fuck melons
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Grapefruit only good with sugar which discounts it
23/01/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: Can’t be consumed solo
23/01/2019, 22:25 - Paul;: Lemon is versatile and great but can’t just munch it
23/01/2019, 22:26 - David;: Fucking peach. It's limp arse shitty flesh
23/01/2019, 22:26 - David;: Can't look after itself. High maintenance
23/01/2019, 22:27 - David;: All berries are too much faff
23/01/2019, 22:27 - Paul;: A good peach if prepared right can be up there
23/01/2019, 22:27 - David;: And I include the strawberry in that
23/01/2019, 22:28 - Paul;: Too much can go wrong with a strawberry
23/01/2019, 22:28 - David;: Lol
23/01/2019, 22:34 - Stefan;: How have you left out the almighty mango
23/01/2019, 22:34 - Paul;: Mango is shit
23/01/2019, 22:35 - Paul;: Again the texture is hit and miss
23/01/2019, 22:35 - David;: Can be great under very specific circumstances
23/01/2019, 22:35 - Stefan;: Mango can fuck your shitty peach into next week
23/01/2019, 22:35 - David;: A precision tool
23/01/2019, 22:35 - Paul;: Dried mango however now you’re talking but that’s a conversion to the original fruit so void
23/01/2019, 22:36 - David;: Dried would need a whole different ranking scale
23/01/2019, 22:36 - Stefan;: Apricots - underwhelming in their natural state, but world-beating dried
23/01/2019, 22:36 - Paul;: And create incredible gas
23/01/2019, 22:37 - David;: Make you shit everywhere
23/01/2019, 22:37 - David;: The raisin is a debasement of the grape
23/01/2019, 22:37 - Paul;: Sullied the grape
23/01/2019, 23:26 - Hamish Sinclair: I can confirm this
24/01/2019, 06:08 - Phill: All I can say is fucking kek...
24/01/2019, 06:08 - Phill: >apples
24/01/2019, 06:09 - Phill: >no plum
24/01/2019, 06:09 - Phill: >melon that far down....
24/01/2019, 06:10 - Phill: You spastic?
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Phill: >no cloudberry
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Phill: >no berries full stop.
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Phill: 0/10 list, would not Schindler
24/01/2019, 07:34 - Rob;: Nah but in an oatmeal cookie, or porridge. A revelation
24/01/2019, 07:35 - Rob;: Raspberry, blueberry, no faff
24/01/2019, 07:35 - Phill: Famously no faff. No cutting. No peeling. Just gumping.
24/01/2019, 07:36 - Rob;: Yeah the least faff of all fruit
24/01/2019, 07:37 - Phill: The only thing an apple is good for is it's juice. It's flesh can fucking die.
24/01/2019, 07:43 - Rob;: Cooking it improves it - apple sauce, or caramelised apple
24/01/2019, 07:43 - Rob;: But cooking improves almost all fruit. Fight me
24/01/2019, 07:45 - Phill: All juice related. Cooking concentrates and caramelises the juice. The flesh of the apple is just a shit vessel.
24/01/2019, 07:45 - Phill: Without the juice the apple would be nothing. Like Garfunkel without Simon.
24/01/2019, 07:46 - Rob;: A juiceless fruit
24/01/2019, 07:46 - Rob;: That's a nut
24/01/2019, 07:46 - Phill: Banana.
24/01/2019, 07:47 - Rob;: A terrible fruit
24/01/2019, 07:47 - Phill: Burn, scrub.
24/01/2019, 07:48 - Phill: God Tier: all fruit except those listed in other tiers. 
Tolerable tier: oranges. 



Shit tier: apples.
24/01/2019, 07:49 - Phill: I would put grapes in tolerable tier, but can't because wine.
24/01/2019, 07:50 - Phill: There's a reason we gump apple and orange juice. Protip: it's because theyre a dry hump of a whole fruit.
24/01/2019, 07:50 - Rob;: The boisonberry sounds like a Blane Bloomy sort of berry
24/01/2019, 07:53 - Phill: >not gumping bucket loads of cloudberries foraged from the forests of Scandinavia
24/01/2019, 07:53 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/01/2019, 10:30 - / James Ball: This is an integral bit of thread action.
Melon > good but faffy
Apple > easy win
Banana > no problem
Grapes > ok
Nectarines and peaches > good in other countries but not here
Grapefruit and oranges > not good
Little orange ones > good
Cloudberries > very good
Pear > not raw, only good in baking, pear tarte tatin?
Tomatoes, the forgotten fruit > cheap ones flavourless, good ones amazing

24/01/2019, 10:35 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
24/01/2019, 10:38 - Rob;: I'd like to poor hot piss all over the tomato is a fruit bullshit. If you start bringing scientific classifications of plant parts into it then suddenly nothing can be a vegetable, barely and fruits are fruits, and a watermelon is technically a Garibaldi
24/01/2019, 10:39 - Rob;: Fruit and veg are fluid categories based on taste and use
24/01/2019, 10:39 - Rob;: Tomatoes are eaten like a vegetable in savoury dishes most of the time and are not a fruit in any meaningful way
24/01/2019, 10:40 - Paul;: Fuck tomato being a fruit
24/01/2019, 10:40 - Paul;: Fuck right off
24/01/2019, 10:41 - Paul;: Only goes well with basil, balsamic, oil and mozzarella- I will not consume it in any other fashion apart from maybe on top of a pizza.
24/01/2019, 10:46 - Phill: >maybe on top of a pizza
24/01/2019, 10:46 - Phill: >What is base sauce
24/01/2019, 10:47 - Phill: >maybe
24/01/2019, 10:49 - / James Ball: I do have snacking tomatoes on long work days and drives sometimes
24/01/2019, 10:49 - David;: Chile's, spaghetti bol. Well the list is endless.
24/01/2019, 10:50 - / James Ball: Baby plum though not a fuck off beef tomato
24/01/2019, 10:51 - Phill: Why we even slating the tomato? If it turned its back on us we'd be fucked. Underrated.
24/01/2019, 10:51 - Phill: Leave the tomato out of this.
24/01/2019, 10:51 - David;: Yeah it's veg. Neutral
24/01/2019, 10:52 - David;: Next you'll be having a go at the onion
24/01/2019, 10:53 - / James Ball: My ex girlfriend hated onions and garlic - cooking was difficult
24/01/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: I'm not blaming tomato
24/01/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Just don't bring them into this
24/01/2019, 10:57 - / James Ball: Amendment:
Tomato > not counted.
24/01/2019, 10:58 - / James Ball: Sultanas and raisins? Fruit?
24/01/2019, 11:03 - Phill: middle class stay at home 35 year old range rover mum with kid called casper shit tier "treats" imho
24/01/2019, 11:03 - Phill: SHIT TIER
24/01/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: Raisin as an ingredient = good. Solo is shit tier
24/01/2019, 11:06 - / James Ball: Strongly disagree. Sultanas in curries pretty disappointing
24/01/2019, 11:06 - David;: Even as ingriedient I always hate it. Adds nothing
24/01/2019, 11:07 - David;: 'you've got a lovely sugary treat there. Do you want me to put a chewy, stringy savoury ball of shit in the middle that will monopolise everything?'
24/01/2019, 11:08 - David;: Thanks but no thanks
24/01/2019, 11:08 - Rob;: But the oat and raisin cookie
24/01/2019, 11:08 - David;: No
24/01/2019, 11:08 - Rob;: My favourite cookie
24/01/2019, 11:09 - Paul;: Rob your tastebuds are all over the place
24/01/2019, 11:09 - / James Ball: chocolate chip > oat and rasin
24/01/2019, 11:10 - Paul;: Those stupid fucking Moroccan dishes they ruin with currants. Will not eat
24/01/2019, 11:11 - Rob;: Agree not a fan of them in savoury food
24/01/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: You seem to be colluding heavily with currants though. I don’t trust it
24/01/2019, 11:15 - David;: Should be a sultana magasine called Currant Affairs
24/01/2019, 12:48 - Paul;: <Media omitted>

24/01/2019, 12:50 - Paul;: I’m underlining apricots
24/01/2019, 12:51 - David;: Ah right.
24/01/2019, 12:51 - David;: But you need to conduct this experiment
24/01/2019, 12:51 - David;: Log the effects on the app
24/01/2019, 12:51 - Paul;: I’m not having fruit in a savoury dish
24/01/2019, 12:58 - Rob;: Apple sauce?
24/01/2019, 12:59 - Paul;: Need a new category
24/01/2019, 12:59 - Paul;: Cranberry sauce
24/01/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: Dried apricots in a tagine are fine. Dates too
24/01/2019, 13:00 - Paul;: Nonce sense
24/01/2019, 13:01 - Paul;: This is your currant mania talking

24/01/2019, 13:01 - Paul;: Why don’t you just have some melon with your beef rob
24/01/2019, 13:01 - Rob;: Venison and fruit also good
24/01/2019, 13:02 - David;: No. I won't engage in this madness
24/01/2019, 13:02 - Paul;: Lemon chicken. Have picked that out as my dish on Saturday
24/01/2019, 13:03 - David;: Also wrong
24/01/2019, 13:03 - / James Ball: Duck and orange?
24/01/2019, 13:04 - David;: Citrus in any context apart from mexican, puddings or G+T is wrong
24/01/2019, 13:04 - Paul;: We need a committee to oversee classification and acceptable foods
24/01/2019, 13:05 - Rob;: Jack a l'orange
24/01/2019, 13:06 - Rob;: Lol, so no lemon anywhere?
24/01/2019, 13:06 - David;: Yeah, in suites (your sorbets for example) or G + T.
24/01/2019, 13:07 - David;: Then I'm giving the mexicans lime because they do good work with it.
24/01/2019, 13:07 - David;: Nowhere else

24/01/2019, 13:07 - Paul;: Apple in pigs mouth

25/01/2019, 18:22 - / James Ball: If you want to fuck up the advertisers there's an addon for most browsers called adnauseum that registers clicks with all adverts so the advertisers have no way of profiling you - "he clicks on everything"
25/01/2019, 18:36 - Damian Rumble: Not sure why you want to avoid being profiled... The whole point of our ad targeting algorithms is to ensure you don't get shown ads you don't want to see. Having something like will just ensure that you keep seeing irrelevant and annoying material
25/01/2019, 18:37 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
25/01/2019, 18:38 - Damian Rumble: Also I went to weed shop styled like a apple store in Nevada and legally bought a joint. It was great.
25/01/2019, 18:46 - / James Ball: I don't get shown ads because I have adblockers on everything anyway. So, see no ads and also don't allow a third party to build up a profile

25/01/2019, 21:54 - David;: You'd almost say he has an interest in promoting it
25/01/2019, 21:55 - Phill: Will be funny when we leave Earth and we don't let Facebook come and they get left behind on this husk of a planet just profiling each other, Damian's space dreams crushed

25/01/2019, 21:59 - Sam;: Yeah that’s their problem if the clicks are shit
25/01/2019, 21:59 - David;: Will suck click for cash
25/01/2019, 22:01 - Sam;: Play them at their own game. Make them pay you to sift through your raw shit
25/01/2019, 22:03 - Phill: Create a virus that just constantly creates millions of Facebook accounts with random a random georeference and then just proceeds to click random ads
25/01/2019, 22:07 - Rob;: That's a lot of effort for no direct gain

26/01/2019, 00:46 - Damian Rumble: Idiots and dillusional. You can't escape the big data revolution unless you are willing to go and live under a rock.

29/01/2019, 22:36 - Rob;: Wipe arse on pets after feeding them our turds would be better
29/01/2019, 22:36 - Rob;: Better with some pets than others
29/01/2019, 22:39 - Paul;: Hairless cats not ideal
29/01/2019, 22:41 - Rob;: Could floss with a snake though

30/01/2019, 17:35 - Sam;: Rob, what’s the fan view on Denis Suarez?
30/01/2019, 17:36 - Sam;: Ex city youngster, now snuffled from barca
30/01/2019, 17:36 - Paul;: Can someone please tell me the fan consensus on Gonzalo Balbi
30/01/2019, 17:37 - Sam;: He was widely considered to be almost as much of a cunt as you
30/01/2019, 17:37 - Sam;: Almost
30/01/2019, 17:37 - Jack G;: Denis the menace
30/01/2019, 17:43 - Sam;: <Media omitted>

30/01/2019, 17:44 - Sam;: The froust myth
30/01/2019, 18:02 - Rob;: A useful signing for now, if not overly inspiring.
30/01/2019, 18:03 - Rob;: Think it's a good deal to have the option, but not obligation to buy. If he's good, we'll keep him
30/01/2019, 18:03 - Rob;: Possibly the wrong Suarez from Barcelona?
30/01/2019, 18:05 - Sam;: Lol nah leave luis to them
30/01/2019, 18:06 - Sam;: Too much to bite in London
30/01/2019, 18:09 - David;: Entirely the wrong Suarez
30/01/2019, 21:10 - David;: Um hello. Chelsea

30/01/2019, 21:11 - Sam;: Very fit boy
30/01/2019, 21:13 - David;: Good legs on him

30/01/2019, 21:20 - Phill: ?
30/01/2019, 21:33 - Rob;: One more goal for Bournemouth and Arsenal would go above Chelsea
30/01/2019, 21:34 - Sam;: Huge race for top four. Spurs need to be careful
30/01/2019, 21:35 - Paul;: Where’s Manchester poonited 💩 in all this?

30/01/2019, 22:17 - Rob;: You have to feel he may have given blow jobs as payment before in order for anyone to have the idea to ask
30/01/2019, 22:18 - Rob;: And was the customs guy definitely gay?
30/01/2019, 22:18 - Rob;: Maybe he didn't want his dick sucked by an old dude
30/01/2019, 22:19 - Phill: Customs officials are notorious for fiending head from old gay men.
30/01/2019, 22:19 - David;: If you don't ask you don't get
30/01/2019, 22:20 - Rob;: Is it easy to cover up $250,000 of missing fees?
30/01/2019, 22:21 - Rob;: A rent boy would cost a lot less
30/01/2019, 22:25 - Paul;: I don’t think they would be real fees
30/01/2019, 22:25 - Paul;: More of a bribe
30/01/2019, 22:26 - Rob;: Ah of course. Pure blow job bait
30/01/2019, 23:38 - David;: Love to watch all the bullshit about jorginho evaporating.
31/01/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: Not Fellaini
31/01/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: End of an era
31/01/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: Outlasted by Moye's original contract length
31/01/2019, 11:22 - David;: This has to be a symbolic move. Purging the last vestiges of Moyes.
31/01/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
31/01/2019, 11:23 - Jack G;: Didn’t they some how manage to be more than the release clause for him too?
31/01/2019, 11:23 - Jack G;: Pay more*
31/01/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: Yeah, the clause expired, then they bought him
31/01/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: Delaying as he wasn't first choice
31/01/2019, 11:24 - Sam;: Loving Ole even more. Don’t even want him as a back up
31/01/2019, 11:29 - Jack G;: No more hoof ball as plan b
31/01/2019, 11:40 - Paul;: Have they got ole in as confirmed manager
31/01/2019, 11:40 - Paul;: Or has he always been the caretaker
31/01/2019, 11:42 - David;: Caretaker
31/01/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: If he gets top four surely he has to get the job right Sambo?
31/01/2019, 11:45 - Paul;: I don’t understand why they wouldn’t keep him on
31/01/2019, 11:46 - Paul;: Mark Hughes too rich for his shoes. How long ago was that?
31/01/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: 2008-9
31/01/2019, 12:13 - Sam;: It works both ways for them to do caretaker first. If he was shit - only caretaker. If this suddenly turns to shit now - only CT. but being CT takes pressure off him. 

The only worry now is the di Matteo effect if he gets the job
31/01/2019, 12:13 - Phill: Great little long read on BBC news about this guy who became a house MC in the 80's called Hooligan X and then tried to ship tonnes of weed from the Lebanon

31/01/2019, 15:13 - Rob;: It's a loan so I guess it is a return
31/01/2019, 15:16 - Rob;: Yannick Bolasie not proving to have been a great £25m investment for Everton
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: He was so good at Palace before they signed him
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Got a massive injury in his first season there
31/01/2019, 15:17 - Rob;: Yeah a Fantasy favourite then
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Never came back
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Yeah - and just great direct wing play
31/01/2019, 15:17 - David;: Rated him
31/01/2019, 15:18 - Rob;: Football would be great if injuries were eliminated. Just full potential everywhere, all the time
31/01/2019, 15:18 - Rob;: Smaller squads as a result, so talent more evenly distributed
31/01/2019, 15:19 - David;: Also he wears black boots
31/01/2019, 15:19 - David;: That instantly adds 20% to my estimation of a player
31/01/2019, 15:20 - Rob;: Same

01/02/2019, 11:31 - / James Ball: Of the ancient Egyptian people - the Nubians?
01/02/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: That's and Anglo-Nubian goat
01/02/2019, 11:32 - / James Ball: Aha.
01/02/2019, 11:32 - / James Ball: I can't do goat's cheese any more. Tastes too much like rancid farm.
01/02/2019, 11:32 - / James Ball: I used to like it but something switched a few years ago unfortunately
01/02/2019, 11:40 - Phill: Yes James. I'm the same. Fucking putrid shit.
01/02/2019, 11:41 - Paul;: Stocked at daylesford

01/02/2019, 11:44 - / James Ball: I was in Italy once and this goat herder went past. The stench. All these goats around the car with massive prolapsed vaginas and huge udders. Fucking awful
01/02/2019, 11:45 - Paul;: >not sucking at the delicious goat prolapse
01/02/2019, 11:45 - Phill: >readily gumping hormonal sludge
01/02/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: That 'it's not natural' argument is bollocks. We evolved lactase to digest it. Evolution takes ages. Anything that's evolved is definitely natural
01/02/2019, 11:49 - / James Ball: I'm all for cheese and diary. Just not goat
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: You can be disgusted by modern dairy farming, but there's nothing more normal for a northern European to be doing than locking their lips round a cow's tit
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Phill: Which is why almost 70% of people lose their ability to effectively digest lactose after infancy? NEXT
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Not true
01/02/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: You plebs should go back to your babybel and dairylee
01/02/2019, 11:50 - Phill: Approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy. Lactose intolerance in adulthood is most prevalent in people of East Asian descent, affecting more than 90 percent of adults in some of these communities. Lactose intolerance is also very common in people of West African, Arab, Jewish, Greek, and Italian descent

01/02/2019, 11:50 - Phill: NEXT
01/02/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Reduced is different to ineffective
01/02/2019, 11:50 - Phill: No
01/02/2019, 11:51 - / James Ball: Babybel yes, dairylee no
01/02/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: Obviously no need to be as effective as when you only drink milk as a baby
01/02/2019, 11:51 - / James Ball: Asians also have the defective alcohol gene right? So they can't breakdown alcohol? Sucks to be Asian
01/02/2019, 11:51 - Phill: My sperm count is reduced. My penis is ineffective.
01/02/2019, 11:52 - / James Ball: Give them a baileys and really fuck them up
01/02/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: Ineffective is an absolute,  term, a reduction can be of any amount
01/02/2019, 11:52 - Phill: No
01/02/2019, 11:53 - Phill: It can be extremely ineffective or mildly ineffective
01/02/2019, 11:53 - / James Ball: Yeah, I'd say ineffective is relative rather than absolute
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253(17)30154-1/fulltext
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: My leg came off. I’m now mildly ineffective at football
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: Here's another dairy study recently published in the Lancet
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: DYOR
01/02/2019, 11:54 - Phill: There is a reduction in your effectiveness
01/02/2019, 11:55 - Phill: In summary:
01/02/2019, 11:55 - Phill: Lactose malabsorption is widespread in most of the world, with wide variation between different regions and an overall frequency of around two-thirds of the world's population. Acknowledging regional patterns of lactose malabsorption is important to guide management of gastrointestinal symptoms.
01/02/2019, 11:56 - Phill: Brb. Need to get my cheese on toast out the grill
01/02/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: That 60% figure is worldwide, most non Europeans haven't evolved to retain adult lactose. I specifically said northern European
01/02/2019, 11:56 - / James Ball: Dairy free cheese I hope
01/02/2019, 11:57 - Paul;: Dairylee on toast
01/02/2019, 11:57 - Paul;: Grilled
01/02/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: That study is true, and it's also true that Europeans can deal with lactose much better than any other group
01/02/2019, 11:58 - Phill: The figure for Northern Europe is still a third. A significant amount. 3 of us in this thread are ineffective at turning it into normal shit.
01/02/2019, 11:59 - Paul;: Sam can’t deal with dairy
01/02/2019, 11:59 - Sam;: I’m not having this
01/02/2019, 12:00 - Sam;: It’s only when packed on booze
01/02/2019, 12:00 - / James Ball: I admit that I avoid whole milk and cream in things cos it can make me feel a bit sick if I have loads
01/02/2019, 12:00 - / James Ball: No problem with cheese though
01/02/2019, 12:00 - Sam;: Don’t use me to fight your dairy war
01/02/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: 🎵 Sam Sam the lactose man 🎶 - it’s what all the kids sing
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Rob;: I think there are many good reasons to cut down on dairy, but the idea that it's unatural isn't one for me
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Sam;: Shitting out his guts into Paul’s bed pan
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Phill: Eating meat is also unnatural because we don't have evolved canines. Come at me.
01/02/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: Would you eat cobwebs rob? Just suck them out a spiders tit?
01/02/2019, 12:02 - Rob;: Not unatural as we depend on vitamin b12, of which there's no plant-source your body is able to access
01/02/2019, 12:02 - Rob;: Yes
01/02/2019, 12:03 - Paul;: >Robweb

01/02/2019, 12:04 - Paul;: Lol
01/02/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: Like an 80 year old
01/02/2019, 12:04 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 12:05 - / James Ball: We don't have enormous canines but then nor do many omnivores. Also we evolved cooking so don't need to bite off hunks of raw meat
01/02/2019, 12:06 - Phill: Lol "evolved cooking"
01/02/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Exactly, so we need to cook it to eat it. A true carnivore could eat it raw.
01/02/2019, 12:08 - Phill: Rob if you're so meat, go to Tesco and buy some raw chicken and pork and just eat it and see what happens. NEXT
01/02/2019, 12:09 - / James Ball: We're not carnivores though
01/02/2019, 12:09 - Phill: So why we eating meat?
01/02/2019, 12:09 - / James Ball: Omnivores innit
01/02/2019, 12:09 - / James Ball: Bit of everything
01/02/2019, 12:09 - Phill: Don't buy it. It's a term created by the liberal media.
01/02/2019, 12:11 - Rob;: I like how you've worked your self into a situation where you're invoking right-wing rhetoric to defend your left-wing position
01/02/2019, 12:12 - Rob;: You should probably be used in schools to improve debating skills
01/02/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: How to argue with someone who's position is constantly shifting based on an algorithm designed to annoy you as much as it can
01/02/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: *whose
01/02/2019, 12:15 - Phill: Would be great to just fake news everyone into quitting smoking, reducing drinking, eating more veg, doing more exercise
01/02/2019, 12:16 - Phill: It should be the NHS new aggressive marketing company for healthy living
01/02/2019, 12:16 - Phill: Campaign*
01/02/2019, 12:17 - Phill: Also you can get enough b12 from mushrooms.
01/02/2019, 12:17 - Phill: next...
01/02/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: 0% b12
01/02/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: So the aims are good, but the logic, facts and arguments are incorrect and exhausting?
01/02/2019, 12:19 - / James Ball: I can confirm I passively lost about 1.5-2kg from dry January.
01/02/2019, 12:20 - / James Ball: Or at least, during January
01/02/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: But how many friends?
01/02/2019, 12:20 - / James Ball: Passively or actively?
01/02/2019, 12:21 - Sam;: Lol. actively. Fuk off m8
01/02/2019, 12:24 - Phill: NO
01/02/2019, 12:24 - Phill: <Media omitted>
01/02/2019, 12:27 - Phill: Precisely
01/02/2019, 12:27 - Phill: Just pound them into submission
01/02/2019, 12:28 - Phill: Also, the facts arguments I have presented today are not incorrect.
01/02/2019, 12:28 - Phill: Just FYI.
01/02/2019, 12:36 - Paul;: Supported by scientific journals
01/02/2019, 12:37 - Paul;: But he’s still a dairylee eating non tastebud having heretic
01/02/2019, 12:40 - Phill: At the end of the day
01/02/2019, 12:40 - Phill: >goats cheese.
01/02/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: Relatively high is misleading here. The recommended daily intake of b12 is about 2 micrograms, if umfresh shiitake mushrooms contain at most 13 _milli_ grams per 100, that's only 0.013 micrograms. To get the recommended 2 micrograms you would need to eat 15.7kg of fresh shiitake mushrooms per day
01/02/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: Which perhaps you are
01/02/2019, 12:42 - / James Ball: Micrograms are smaller than milligrams
01/02/2019, 12:42 - / James Ball: 13 milligrams = 1300 micrograms
01/02/2019, 12:43 - / James Ball: Or 13000
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Phill: Yeah we take drugs in miligrams
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Ah yeah lol
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Still, shiitake mushrooms very specific
01/02/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Would be much easier just to take supplements
01/02/2019, 12:56 - / James Ball: I'm growing some mushrooms currently

01/02/2019, 12:58 - Phill: We bought some spawn and I went to Costa and asked for their waste grinds

01/02/2019, 19:07 - Phill: Iwobi gets ready to strike!
01/02/2019, 19:08 - David;: 'Zach Medley prepares a strike'
01/02/2019, 19:09 - Phill: Cech leaps over a pile of snow!
01/02/2019, 19:11 - Rob;: A live blog about snow seems unnecessary
01/02/2019, 19:12 - Rob;: The outdoors is essentially a live blog about weather anyway
 Could look at that
01/02/2019, 19:22 - David;: Only matter if time before the world is just one big live blog
01/02/2019, 19:22 - David;: No need to actually live it

01/02/2019, 19:50 - Paul;: Yep
01/02/2019, 20:43 - David;: >@447507485445
01/02/2019, 23:08 - Sam;: Bobby robson documentary on Netflix is big
01/02/2019, 23:08 - David;: The footballer?
01/02/2019, 23:09 - Sam;: And manager
01/02/2019, 23:09 - David;: Currently finishing Sunderland till I die
01/02/2019, 23:09 - David;: It all just falls to shit
01/02/2019, 23:10 - Sam;: The butthurt is so good
01/02/2019, 23:10 - Sam;: Total destruction
01/02/2019, 23:10 - David;: The best thing is all the hope they invest in Coleman as the saviour
01/02/2019, 23:11 - David;: Also when Rodwell is on 70000 a week, not training but refuses to leave so they're laying off vital first team players to cover his wages.
01/02/2019, 23:12 - Sam;: Yeah. Really shows him up to just be sold school ‘motivator’ type.
01/02/2019, 23:12 - David;: Yeah, he changes nothing
01/02/2019, 23:12 - Sam;: Yeah rodwell. Just trolling. But then again they gave him the contract
01/02/2019, 23:13 - Sam;: Fuck. Robson signed a 19 yr old Ronaldo from PSV
01/02/2019, 23:14 - David;: They're not even guaranteed promotion this season. Currently 5th or so.
01/02/2019, 23:14 - Sam;: Big call
01/02/2019, 23:14 - David;: Ah yeah. Did football
01/02/2019, 23:14 - David;: The pre-injury Ronaldo was mental
01/02/2019, 23:15 - Sam;: Minor sub plot is mourinho as interpreter
01/02/2019, 23:16 - David;: Didn't he claim some sort of influence to ingratiate himself to the English press?
01/02/2019, 23:19 - Sam;: Haven’t heard that myself. But it turns out robson insisted that mourinho be his assistant. Way more than helping with his Spanish
01/02/2019, 23:42 - David;: Selling your lead goalscorer in January. Classic move
02/02/2019, 10:49 - Rob;: I loved how unsympathetic Grabban is about it
02/02/2019, 10:50 - Rob;: Just like 'fuck them, I wanted out'
02/02/2019, 10:55 - Phill: Been watching this average comedy on BBC called Cuckoo, but there is one great character in it called Steve. Probably in my too five characters of all time.
02/02/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: I watched series one, surprised it's still going
02/02/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: Is Steve the little one
02/02/2019, 10:57 - Phill: Yeah Steve chance
02/02/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: He is good
02/02/2019, 10:57 - Phill: His character has only improved since series 1. Series 5 now.
02/02/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: I watched a bit of one series where they kidnap or try to kill him or something
02/02/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: And couldn't work out how things had escalated to that point
02/02/2019, 10:58 - Phill: Would recommend watching more, if only for Steve.
02/02/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: Are you watching Catastrophe? I'm quite sad this is the last series
02/02/2019, 10:59 - Phill: Nah but heard good things might watch later
02/02/2019, 11:00 - Phill: Off to see the Mappa Mundi today.
02/02/2019, 11:00 - Rob;: Series one is a blinder. It's all on All 4, you should just session it
02/02/2019, 11:00 - Rob;: Probably the best comedy of the last 5 years
02/02/2019, 11:00 - Rob;: Well, one of

02/02/2019, 11:17 - Rob;: Yeah, they pic up a load of medieval maps cheap from Latvia

02/02/2019, 13:01 - Phill: The brioche burger bun is the most important invention of the 21st century. COME THE FUCK AT ME.
02/02/2019, 13:03 - David;: Don't rate
02/02/2019, 13:04 - David;: Too fucking rich
02/02/2019, 13:04 - Paul;: It’s like mixing fruit and meat
02/02/2019, 13:04 - Paul;: Sweet and meat
02/02/2019, 13:05 - Phill: >
02/02/2019, 13:05 - Phill: Sweet?
02/02/2019, 13:05 - Phill: You retarded son?
02/02/2019, 13:08 - Paul;: It’s unnecessary
02/02/2019, 13:10 - David;: Just a plain unseeded bun. No sauce

02/02/2019, 13:22 - Rob;: It is great, but only with classic beef
02/02/2019, 13:22 - Rob;: Hate it when they pair it with any vaguely burger-esque thing just because it's trendy
02/02/2019, 13:22 - Paul;: It’s just a show off no one was asking for
02/02/2019, 13:23 - Rob;: Our work pub does a chip butty with a brioche bun. That's completely unnecessary. If you're having a chip butty you just want cheap white bread. It's grotty food on purpose
02/02/2019, 13:24 - David;: Halloumi in brioche
02/02/2019, 13:24 - David;: I'd rather eat shit

02/02/2019, 13:42 - David;: Yeah, embarassing
02/02/2019, 13:45 - Phill: Enjoy never being able to eat a burger in my presence again without being relentlessly trolled yimmm.

02/02/2019, 16:27 - Phill: Nutmeg is a classic ingredient in bechamel sauce you fucking pleb
02/02/2019, 16:27 - Paul;: They’ve been making it wrong
02/02/2019, 16:27 - Paul;: Or should never make it again
02/02/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: Nutmeg will get you high if you have enough
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: Kill you if you have too much
02/02/2019, 16:30 - Damian Rumble: Do you remember that time I did the nutmeg challenge?

02/02/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: At Dave's I think
02/02/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: Ages ago
02/02/2019, 16:38 - Damian Rumble: Nah it was at my enstone house
02/02/2019, 16:39 - Damian Rumble: Probably was cinnamon thoug
02/02/2019, 16:39 - Damian Rumble: Think nutmeg was a different occasion, outside of the froust
02/02/2019, 16:41 - Rob;: How much did you have?
02/02/2019, 16:41 - Rob;: The lethal dose isn't that high

So that I could kill him."'

05/02/2019, 13:33 - Jack G;: Arnautovic, Nasri, Balbuena, Yarmolenko, Lanzini, Wilshere
05/02/2019, 13:44 - David;: Well actually we also have 6 including Oxlade-Chamberlain and Lovren
05/02/2019, 13:44 - David;: So there
05/02/2019, 13:45 - Jack G;: Fair play
05/02/2019, 13:45 - David;: But 4 recent injuries to first Xi players: Gomez, Henderson, Wijnaldum, Trent
05/02/2019, 13:45 - David;: Would all normally start
05/02/2019, 13:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Also the timing is quite important. Henderson and wijnaldum were withdrawn last minute
05/02/2019, 13:46 - Jack G;: Wijnaldum was the biggest miss last night imo
05/02/2019, 13:46 - David;: Agreed
05/02/2019, 13:46 - Sam;: Good to let Nathaniel Clyne go.. Milner was shocking at right back
05/02/2019, 13:47 - Jack G;: Couldn’t deal with Mr. Anderson
05/02/2019, 13:47 - David;: Yeah. Unfortunate that Trent got injured the week after we decided to do that. But an unecessary risk.
05/02/2019, 13:47 - David;: Thing is usually Gomez can cover it but then he is also injured.
05/02/2019, 13:48 - David;: And Fabinho can also cover it but he is needed in centre mid due to sudden injureis to Hendo and Gini.
05/02/2019, 13:48 - David;: So in theory we still have 2 good covers but been fucked over by other injuries.
05/02/2019, 13:49 - Paul;: No squad depth
05/02/2019, 13:50 - Paul;: One trick pony
05/02/2019, 13:51 - David;: But 2 covers for a position. Very standard, City would not have more than that
05/02/2019, 13:51 - Jack G;: I did enjoy Clyne turning down the opportunity to play for Warnock
05/02/2019, 13:54 - Sam;: Injuries? You’ve thrown the two cup competitions so a clear run at the prem with CL as a bonus
05/02/2019, 13:54 - Sam;: Spurs to win. City third. They’re still  in all four comps
05/02/2019, 13:55 - Jack G;: Please no
05/02/2019, 13:55 - Jack G;: They still have to play pool, city and Chelsea away. Plus a north London derby
05/02/2019, 13:56 - Paul;: Spurs win trolls rob for added bonus troll

05/02/2019, 14:03 - Jack G;: It’s not like they’re top of the league or anything...
05/02/2019, 14:03 - Jack G;: Overreaction
05/02/2019, 14:06 - David;: It's fine, they need their little narrative. The smaller clubs like United need something to hang onto.
05/02/2019, 14:10 - Sam;: We’ll see on February 24th.
05/02/2019, 14:11 - Jack G;: That will be a spicy match
05/02/2019, 14:12 - Paul;: West Ham languishing in 12th. Embarrassing
05/02/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: Thanks
05/02/2019, 14:26 - Rob;: That's got to be quite high got modern West Ham hasn't it?
05/02/2019, 14:29 - Phill: Wut?
05/02/2019, 14:29 - Jack G;: Decent, especially considering we’re 2 points off 8th? We’re generally bottom half except than Payet season where we were somehow in the top 4 race until 3 games before the end of the season. Same season Leicester won

05/02/2019, 14:32 - Rob;: But it's not over yet
05/02/2019, 14:33 - Jack G;: We’ve been fucked by injuries, also took us a while to get used to Pellegrini tactics
05/02/2019, 14:33 - Sam;: One win in five
05/02/2019, 14:34 - Jack G;: Yeah but that win was against arsenal 👌
05/02/2019, 14:35 - Jack G;: Won 6/7 games in December before that
05/02/2019, 14:35 - Jack G;: 5/7*
05/02/2019, 14:38 - Jack G;: Fake news. We came 13th in the 2017/18 season
05/02/2019, 14:40 - Paul;: So much mediocrity with West Ham
05/02/2019, 14:40 - Jack G;: We can’t all be winners
05/02/2019, 14:40 - Paul;: Just change teams

06/02/2019, 17:19 - David;: Clean living
06/02/2019, 17:19 - Paul;: Hilary considers his wife a daughter she never had and he’s there releasing cock pictures
06/02/2019, 17:20 - Paul;: Chooses fame hungry amateur porn stars to message
06/02/2019, 17:21 - David;: Yeah and she has to cut him out of her life for doing too much collateral damage to hernreputation

07/02/2019, 13:14 - Phill: Hearing that Salah, Mane and Robbo are all a doubt for next game because of a nerve injury
07/02/2019, 13:16 - Sam;: The evidence of nerves is that the fans have realised they need to actively guard against producing a tense atmosphere. If there were no nerves they wouldn’t need to get the word around to manage the atmosphere
07/02/2019, 13:17 - David;: No they say 'momentum'. You've misread that as nerves because itfits your little narrative that sky have handed you
07/02/2019, 13:18 - David;: Form/injuries and nerves are not the same thing
07/02/2019, 13:18 - Paul;: 😂
07/02/2019, 13:20 - Sam;: Incorrect. Selective reading there Dave. The guys says they need to get the momentum going *again*.
07/02/2019, 13:21 - David;: Lol your point being? In no way relates to or mentions nerves.
07/02/2019, 13:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Can I no see a reference to nerves
07/02/2019, 13:30 - Sam;: Fuck sake. The nerves have ruined the momentum, hence the need to build it again.
07/02/2019, 13:32 - Sam;: And that’s the narrative in from the fans in the ground boyo!
07/02/2019, 13:33 - Hamish Sinclair: I see no evidence of causality
07/02/2019, 13:35 - David;: No, sorry, no mention of nerves. Unless you attribute all dropped points ever to nerves? Presumably you attributed city's dip in form over Christmas also to nerves then? Oh that's right, no you didn't. Next
07/02/2019, 13:36 - David;: Are Cardiff in the relegation zone because of a season long bout of nerves?
07/02/2019, 13:36 - Paul;: Sunderland nerves
07/02/2019, 13:36 - David;: Yeah big nerves there
07/02/2019, 13:39 - Sam;: Liverpool is nerves. Never win the prem. nose bleed territory. Just like 08/09 and 13/14
07/02/2019, 13:41 - David;: United since fergie left - 6 years of continual nerves
07/02/2019, 13:42 - David;: 'Man United - supplying you with nerves since 2013'
07/02/2019, 13:42 - Sam;: Deflecting. Tut tut
07/02/2019, 13:43 - David;: Sam it's okay, I understand how much the narrative means to you.
07/02/2019, 13:45 - David;: It's fine that you don't need evidence to support it. That's what faith is

10/02/2019, 17:12 - Paul;: Pop tarts are everywhere
10/02/2019, 17:12 - Jack G;: An entire isle of pop tarts?
10/02/2019, 17:12 - Jack G;: Toasters on the opposite side?
10/02/2019, 17:12 - David;: 2 entire isles is the claim
10/02/2019, 17:13 - David;: 66.6% of all products in the shop being pop tarts
10/02/2019, 17:13 - Paul;: Nothing but pop tarts
10/02/2019, 17:13 - Rob;: Yeah, one giant toaster in the third isle

10/02/2019, 17:13 - Paul;: What flavours?
10/02/2019, 17:13 - David;: The flavours of all the ingredients they would usually sell but all in Pop tart form
10/02/2019, 17:13 - Rob;: Flavours follow the usual layout of a shop, so you start with fresh fruit and veg pop tarts
10/02/2019, 17:14 - David;: Lol yeah that's what I'm envisaging
10/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: Then onto fresh pasta, dips, sauces etc
10/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: Then dried goods flavoured pop tarts
10/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: Frozen pop tarts then alcoholic pop tarts last
10/02/2019, 17:14 - David;: The baked bread/croissant Pop tart section. Wine Pop tarts itemised by country and grape
10/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: And toiletries pop tarts
10/02/2019, 17:15 - Sam;: Chelsea nearly falling below arsenal on goal difference here
10/02/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: Aisle ffs
10/02/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: Although there is an isle of pop tarts just off the coast of Eastbourne
10/02/2019, 17:16 - David;: You don't see them these days
10/02/2019, 17:16 - Paul;: The pop tart pop tart flavour

10/02/2019, 17:20 - David;: I'm imagining a gay cross dressing dance ensemble called the pop tarts
10/02/2019, 17:21 - Paul;: Pop tarts are quite flavourless
10/02/2019, 17:21 - David;: Nah
10/02/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: They literally have flavours
10/02/2019, 17:21 - Paul;: All tastes very cardboard
10/02/2019, 17:21 - Jack G;: Let it cool down a little
10/02/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: Yeah you're not ramming your tongue right in after toasting are you? Because that's a sure-fire way to ruin a pop tart experience
10/02/2019, 17:23 - David;: Yeah it's molten plasma
10/02/2019, 17:23 - David;: Rivals the frozen pizza for mouth burn risk
10/02/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: When the cheese coats the roof of your mouth forever
10/02/2019, 17:27 - Paul;: And it ruins your day or maybe even two. Unable to enjoy anything else
10/02/2019, 17:28 - David;: Pallette destroyed
10/02/2019, 17:29 - David;: Veins on roof of mouth exposed and throbbing
10/02/2019, 17:30 - David;: Rob are you aware that panini in Italian is plural and panino is the singular. So everyone is embarrassing themselves ordering 'a panini'
10/02/2019, 17:31 - Paul;: How do you recover from this?

10/02/2019, 19:00 - Paul;: My brothers colon
10/02/2019, 19:00 - David;: 'you ordered panini. Here's the bill'

10/02/2019, 19:27 - David;: No, just strawberry and chocolate
10/02/2019, 19:27 - David;: Austerity britain
10/02/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: What’s your intake of pop tarts? Has it reached the heights of my fab addiction yet?
10/02/2019, 20:06 - David;: Nah just bought that one pack today. Had about 4.
10/02/2019, 20:07 - David;: How's the curry and roast fall out?
10/02/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Sex Education is great
10/02/2019, 21:40 - David;: Yeah yeah
10/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: I'm bringing it right now
10/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: *bineging
11/02/2019, 08:32 - Phill: Filmed in the wye valley. Symonds yeet.
11/02/2019, 08:32 - Phill: Meave is not fit. Come at me.
11/02/2019, 08:37 - David;: Rather be shagging her than not shagging her
11/02/2019, 08:38 - David;: Aimee is fitter
11/02/2019, 10:31 - Paul;: Sambo, if Man U got relegated would you still support them?
11/02/2019, 10:36 - Sam;: You need a job quick mate if this is the sort of stuff you’re thinking about
11/02/2019, 10:37 - Phill: He'd start supporting city I assume
11/02/2019, 10:39 - Paul;: Not sure you could handle the upset. As a Middlesbrough fan it’s something you become used to. Takes real mettle
11/02/2019, 17:27 - / James Ball: Earl Grey tea, better than regular tea. Yay or nay?
11/02/2019, 17:36 - David;: It fools you into thinking it is for a mug or two, but it just doesn't cut through in the same way.
11/02/2019, 17:42 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah. One mug is fine, anymore and it’s a no from me
11/02/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: at Framestore one department all swore by what they called turbo tea - one bag of Earl Grey and one normal bag, with milk
11/02/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: I got really into it for a while
11/02/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: Gives you the premium feel of the Earl, but the oomph of a proper brew
11/02/2019, 17:44 - David;: Oh yeah the blend is good - used to make that with loose leaf, one spoon of normal and one of EG
11/02/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: Yeah, I could drink mug after mug of that
11/02/2019, 17:45 - David;: I will refrain from calling it turbo tea though
11/02/2019, 17:45 - Rob;: 3D Tea was its other name
11/02/2019, 17:48 - David;: Tea already exists in 3 dimensional space
11/02/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: They were the 3D department
11/02/2019, 17:49 - Sam;: Sky sports reporting that Ramsey will get 400k a week. Surely not
11/02/2019, 17:50 - David;: That's making me think all other departments warped into a 2d 16 bit world when they entered the office, like me game and watch
11/02/2019, 17:50 - David;: *mr
11/02/2019, 17:50 - Rob;: Pretty much
11/02/2019, 17:51 - Rob;: Ornstein says it so it must be true
11/02/2019, 17:51 - David;: Where's he off?
11/02/2019, 17:51 - Rob;: Juve
11/02/2019, 17:51 - David;: Fucking juve hoovering up free midfielders
11/02/2019, 17:52 - David;: Pulled the same stunt with Can
11/02/2019, 17:52 - Sam;: I guess it’s the no fee effect. He’s pulled a blinder convincing them he’s worth that
11/02/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: Yeah, I mean he's very good and I would rather we kept him, but it's hard to justify that much
11/02/2019, 17:55 - David;: He won't be first team even
11/02/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: I went to an away day with work today
11/02/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: Held in a synagogue with function rooms for some reason
11/02/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: ...and lunch was pepperoni pizza
11/02/2019, 18:18 - Rob;: The organisers can round and confiscated it after the synagogue were like, 'yeah, you don't really eat pork in here'
11/02/2019, 18:19 - Rob;: Literally pulling it from people's hands
11/02/2019, 18:21 - Paul;: Who was organising that?
11/02/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: Some wanky business development company
11/02/2019, 18:22 - Paul;: Good mistake to make. Did they have peperami as well?
11/02/2019, 18:22 - Rob;: We all slaughtered a pig as a trust exercise later on
11/02/2019, 18:25 - Paul;: >the Grammys
11/02/2019, 18:25 - Paul;: Very embarrassing

11/02/2019, 19:21 - David;: But child lol
11/02/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: The autocorrect that changed everything
11/02/2019, 19:21 - David;: Even better
11/02/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: >eating your spicy child
11/02/2019, 19:22 - Paul;: What chillis are you using?
11/02/2019, 19:22 - Rob;: God, I'm pissing myself
11/02/2019, 19:22 - David;: Birds eye
11/02/2019, 19:23 - David;: Devestation
11/02/2019, 19:23 - Paul;: Is it even nice to eat or just too much?
11/02/2019, 19:23 - David;: Far too much. Eyes watering
11/02/2019, 19:24 - Rob;: I made a great chilli sauce with haberneros, a more rounded flavoursome heat than bird's eye
11/02/2019, 19:24 - David;: I've put a lot of smoked paprika in as well plus crushed Chiles and cumin
11/02/2019, 19:25 - David;: Found a drop of Lea and perrins in a Chile actually works. Adds sweetness.
11/02/2019, 19:26 - Rob;: Yeah sweetness in chilli is a big thing
11/02/2019, 19:26 - David;: Yeah vital
11/02/2019, 19:26 - Rob;: A lot of recipes use cinnamon, which is good if you balance it right
11/02/2019, 19:26 - David;: Sirachi is good because has a lot of sugar in
11/02/2019, 19:26 - Rob;: And salt
11/02/2019, 19:27 - David;: Tinned sweet corn as well for the sugar
11/02/2019, 19:27 - Paul;: Next you’ll start adding fruit
11/02/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: I use carrots in the base, which cook down and caramelise really nicely
11/02/2019, 19:28 - David;: Yep I use carrots, peppers and sweet corn
11/02/2019, 19:28 - David;: With mince and chopped tomato
11/02/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Sweet corn better charred seperately I'd say
11/02/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Usually just replace meat with more beans now
11/02/2019, 19:29 - David;: Nah it works. Black beans > kidney
11/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: Kidney are wank
11/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: The humble haricot is better
11/02/2019, 19:29 - David;: Black mate
11/02/2019, 19:30 - Rob;: Back good, but prefer in a  mix
11/02/2019, 19:30 - Rob;: *black are good
11/02/2019, 19:30 - David;: Don't like the paid colour of haricot
11/02/2019, 19:30 - David;: *palid
11/02/2019, 19:31 - Rob;: I sometimes throw in a tin of baked beans
11/02/2019, 19:33 - Paul;: I prefer a flan
11/02/2019, 20:51 - Phill: Made caremalised onion rice, garlic chicken and lemon yoghurt yesterday
11/02/2019, 20:51 - Phill: Peng pong
11/02/2019, 20:54 - Phill: My intestines are very effective at turning brown rice and chicken into perfect shit
11/02/2019, 20:54 - Phill: None of this tomato based slurry
11/02/2019, 21:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Dave, thoughts on coffee and chocolate in your chili?
11/02/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Surely this is too far
11/02/2019, 21:33 - David;: Never tried it. Not adverse to the chocolate but suspicious of the coffee
11/02/2019, 21:34 - David;: Lol. The loony left. Political correctness gone mad.
11/02/2019, 21:35 - Phill: Dan and Karen adding dairy milk and kenco to their frozen chilli
11/02/2019, 21:40 - Paul;: Redbull and horlicks
11/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: Red bull could work
11/02/2019, 21:41 - David;: There's that recipe where you boil chicken in Coke and it actually tastes great. Caremelises
11/02/2019, 21:42 - Phill: Yeah coke chicken goat. Also cooked a ham in coke this Christmas. Peng.
11/02/2019, 21:42 - Jack G;: Works well with gammon too
11/02/2019, 21:42 - Rob;: Yet brioche: 'too sweet'
11/02/2019, 21:43 - Paul;: Lol
11/02/2019, 21:43 - Paul;: Different entirely
11/02/2019, 21:43 - David;: Not the same

11/02/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: Yeah leave our party rings alone Dave
11/02/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: The way the glaze dissolves on your tongue is peng
11/02/2019, 21:51 - David;: You'll have plenty of party rings after brexit rob
11/02/2019, 21:51 - Phill: Glaze tonguing followed by sweet dry biscuit
11/02/2019, 21:51 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 21:51 - Jack G;: So many better biscuit options than party rings
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Rob;: There was actually a national biscuit shortage for like a year after those floods in the north hit the United biscuit factory, who make all the own-brand biscuits too
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 21:52 - Paul;: A place where glacier mints for some reason often make an appearance. The worst

11/02/2019, 21:53 - Phill: Bet if I bought a ten bag and a load of party rings and iced gems they would be fucking gone
11/02/2019, 21:54 - David;: Agree. Not even food. Wouldn't serve them to my pets
11/02/2019, 21:55 - David;: Not a fair scientific test
11/02/2019, 21:55 - Paul;: Phil can you create the meme village hall party starter pack

11/02/2019, 22:00 - Paul;: And watery ham
11/02/2019, 22:00 - Phill: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: A cheap Victoria sponge with an inch of icing and Moulan printed on the top
11/02/2019, 22:03 - Paul;: The little cup cakes with edible paper on them of Spider-Man or other generic thing
11/02/2019, 22:06 - David;: The wierd cheese twist things?
11/02/2019, 22:06 - David;: Feels like breathing cheese flavoured air
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Paul;: >turkey twizzlers
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Stefan;: Limp celery sticks with an unidentifiable dip
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Paul;: >potato smiley faces
11/02/2019, 22:07 - Stefan;: The healthy option
11/02/2019, 22:08 - Rob;: Ah yeah, that four-dip pack, where they're not labelled and you're not sure which is which
11/02/2019, 22:09 - Rob;: And they're white, off-white, salmon pink and white-pink
11/02/2019, 22:09 - Rob;: One's very horrible, the others taste the same
11/02/2019, 22:10 - Stefan;: You could definitely do a Brian Butterfield village fete food selection
11/02/2019, 22:10 - Paul;: That weird ham that had shapes in it
11/02/2019, 22:11 - Paul;: Looking and tasting worse than regular ham
11/02/2019, 22:12 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 22:32 - David;: Lol nah, do I no remember that
11/02/2019, 22:32 - David;: Looks fucking rank
11/02/2019, 22:36 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
11/02/2019, 22:54 - Rob;: At least it's honest about being reformed
11/02/2019, 22:55 - Rob;: Even the premium ranges of supermarket ham are reformed
11/02/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: Ham can fuck off outside of the form of gammon
11/02/2019, 22:58 - Paul;: “Ham can fuck off”
11/02/2019, 22:58 - David;: Lol
11/02/2019, 22:59 - David;: What's wrong with a bit of reforming? Everything is reformed. All the matter in the universe has been reformed anyway.
11/02/2019, 23:00 - Paul;: >the reformation
11/02/2019, 23:00 - David;: I'm a reformed man.
11/02/2019, 23:00 - David;: The reformed church
11/02/2019, 23:01 - Rob;: Pork-effect slices
11/02/2019, 23:01 - Rob;: Ham-esque mousemats
11/02/2019, 23:01 - Paul;: Was in daylesford and they’re selling packs of ham at £40. 6 slices
11/02/2019, 23:02 - Rob;: Imitation thin pig
11/02/2019, 23:02 - Rob;: That's probably great ham
11/02/2019, 23:03 - Paul;: You should be slamming the ham. You’re anti-Ham
11/02/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: Agree with good ham, but it's very hard to come by, and very expensive. If I'm having meat these days I'm not choosing ham
11/02/2019, 23:04 - Paul;: What about Iberian ham?
11/02/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: That's good
11/02/2019, 23:05 - Rob;: Literally has to be cut directly from a single piece of pig
11/02/2019, 23:06 - Rob;: All quality versions of ham are nice. Supermarket packet ham is mostly gross.
11/02/2019, 23:06 - David;: If you just want a nice ham and cheese toastie? You're not going to put gammon in that
11/02/2019, 23:06 - David;: That would be mental
11/02/2019, 23:06 - Rob;: Bacon in a cheese toastie
11/02/2019, 23:06 - Rob;: But shredded gammon would be great
11/02/2019, 23:07 - Rob;: Or just cheese
11/02/2019, 23:08 - David;: You've gone insane
11/02/2019, 23:09 - Rob;: Thin packet ham can't deal with heat. Doesn't crisp up. You can't trust it.
11/02/2019, 23:10 - Paul;: But then it wouldn’t be a cheese and ham toastie. Must include ham
11/02/2019, 23:10 - Rob;: Well yeah, well then if you put a gun to my head and make me make a cheese and ham toastie I'd just buy good quality ham and it would be fine
11/02/2019, 23:12 - Rob;: But eating formed ham is like eating chicken nuggets
11/02/2019, 23:19 - Damian Rumble: Does anyone fancy summarising the last 200 messages for me? Sorry I was playing purudo at the pub...
11/02/2019, 23:37 - Rob;: Just read it
11/02/2019, 23:37 - Rob;: You'll have...
11/02/2019, 23:37 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 06:13 - Phill: Ham is great. No arguments. Would rek a packet of Billy bear ham
12/02/2019, 08:02 - Phill: Old Gary lineker
12/02/2019, 08:02 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 08:02 - Rob;: But also old Peter Myson
12/02/2019, 09:27 - Hamish Sinclair: UTD surely favourites to go through against PSG? No Cavan, no neymar
12/02/2019, 09:32 - Sam;: I’m actually looking forward to it which a long way from when the draw was made
12/02/2019, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: I put a fiver on utd to win the champions league
12/02/2019, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: The whole set up has a very di Mateo Chelsea vibe
12/02/2019, 09:59 - Hamish Sinclair: I will support any team trying to knock psg out of the chamionsleague, so for this round only...
12/02/2019, 10:02 - David;: Lol sounds like a statement from your press office on brexit policy 'i am willing to support any team attempting to find a solution to the psg problem that can command a majority in the house and will work with United where this is in the national interest'
12/02/2019, 10:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, I feel like in the next sentence I need to down play my own leadership/champions league ambitions
12/02/2019, 10:08 - David;: Spurs Dortmund is also big
12/02/2019, 10:08 - David;: Sancho back at wembley
12/02/2019, 10:11 - Phill: We will go to the Parc De Princes and do what we have set out to do from the start, and that is to deliver the will of the fans. We will not be bullied into an untenable position where we return to Manchester without concessions on the "No Away Goals Compromise" We will not be discussing the nuances of our plan in public.
12/02/2019, 10:15 - Jack G;: Hard to stop them scoring without a backstop
12/02/2019, 10:15 - Sam;: Lol
12/02/2019, 10:16 - Sam;: We want a hard border in this case
12/02/2019, 10:35 - Rob;: Our plan is to limit Mbappe's freedom of movement
12/02/2019, 13:05 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 13:11 - / James Ball: Such memories.
12/02/2019, 13:12 - / James Ball: Who else went to that party at the Hook Norton sports and social that the organising parents just abandoned because everyone went outside
12/02/2019, 13:12 - / James Ball: Then we were just left in hook Norton for hours before our parents picked us up
12/02/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: Yeah
12/02/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: That was great
12/02/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: Didn't the sports club cancel it because there was alcohol?
12/02/2019, 13:47 - Rob;: Was it Carmel's party?
12/02/2019, 13:52 - Phill: Carly Jewett wasn't it?
12/02/2019, 13:53 - Rob;: That's it yeah
12/02/2019, 14:01 - / James Ball: I had a feeling it was Carmel's. Carly also had one there but was not abandoned, unless there was more than one Carly party
12/02/2019, 14:02 - / James Ball: Prime travelling businessman opportunity, loads of kids just running around unsupervised. I'm surprised nothing happened
12/02/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: Yeah, it was far worse to shut the party down
12/02/2019, 14:18 - Rob;: 'kids are being irresponsible here, we have no other option than to stop looking after them'
12/02/2019, 16:47 - Phill: FUCK. THIS. HIPSTER. SHIT.
12/02/2019, 16:48 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Jack G;: >beer factory
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Paul;: >the 360 degree can
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Jack G;: It’s a brewery mate
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Phill: The fucking top though
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Phill: Such a massive hole
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Damian Rumble: Love it
12/02/2019, 16:49 - Phill: Why reinvent the fucking can
12/02/2019, 16:58 - Rob;: It is nicer to drink from
12/02/2019, 16:58 - Phill: No it's not
12/02/2019, 16:59 - Phill: It's like a cup, that's too small, but with a metal rim
12/02/2019, 17:01 - David;: I can live with it
12/02/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: Yeah it's fine
12/02/2019, 17:02 - Rob;: The one I've had by that brand has quite a lot of sediment and it's nice being able to see that so you don't drink it
12/02/2019, 17:02 - Phill: The beer itself is nice, drinking from hope solos anus is not
12/02/2019, 17:03 - Paul;: Don’t get that issue with a can of carling
12/02/2019, 17:03 - Rob;: Normal cans aren't that great to drink from. The bottle or glass are infinitely better than either
12/02/2019, 17:04 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 17:04 - Paul;: Not as good as the stuff you brew yourself

12/02/2019, 17:10 - Paul;: Who’s drinking out of yards?!
12/02/2019, 17:11 - Damian Rumble: Plastic pint number two??? What's wrong with you?
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Phill: Perfectly fine.
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: Where's bottle?
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Phill: Between tin and cardboard
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Jack G;: I’m with Phil, avoiding can wherever possible.
12/02/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: Plastic pints spill your drink when you hold them
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Jack G;: Double up
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Phill: What are basic motor skills
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Rob;: Phil's put normal can third
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Jack G;: Yeah but still only above cardboard
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Phill: Yeah normal can third. Then bottle. Then cardboard.
12/02/2019, 17:13 - Phill: Glass pint and plastic pint way out in front.
12/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: Nah plastic pint feels cheap and nasty
12/02/2019, 17:14 - Phill: But cardboard on the other hand...
12/02/2019, 17:14 - Rob;: There's barely anything in it. Both shit
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: I hope your bringing your yard to glasto Rob
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: I always carry my yard
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Damian Rumble: Second this. Plastic is shit. People who like drinking from plastic are uneducated cretins
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: My yard brings all the guys to the yard
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: And they're like it's better than card
12/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: Damn right it's better than card
12/02/2019, 17:16 - Paul;: >not drinking out of cupped hands
12/02/2019, 17:16 - Phill: I could can you but I'd have to charge 15p recycling tax
12/02/2019, 17:18 - Rob;: This has been something special
12/02/2019, 18:35 - David;: What's the whole killing Eve shite then?
12/02/2019, 18:44 - David;: Sounds fucking bollocks
12/02/2019, 18:47 - Paul;: A lot going on with Sandra Oh’s face
12/02/2019, 18:51 - David;: I won't be watching
12/02/2019, 19:12 - Phill: Killing Eve is actually good.
12/02/2019, 19:19 - Stefan;: It's really good
12/02/2019, 19:22 - Sam;: She doesn’t kill eve
12/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: Yeah I've been meaning to watch. Heard a lot of good things
12/02/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: It's adapted by Phoebe Waller-Bridge from Fleabag, right?
12/02/2019, 19:31 - Stefan;: Yeah it is. You can see her influence in it
12/02/2019, 19:31 - David;: Won't be engaging
12/02/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: What are you going to watch instead?
12/02/2019, 19:32 - David;: Nothing
12/02/2019, 19:32 - David;: Just stare at the wall
12/02/2019, 19:34 - Phill: What's your beef man...
12/02/2019, 19:35 - David;: Annoying people raving about it
12/02/2019, 19:35 - Paul;: Hasn’t it been around for ages?
12/02/2019, 19:35 - Rob;: Yeah it was on months and months ago I think
12/02/2019, 19:36 - David;: Everyone keeps talking about it. Fucking everywhere
12/02/2019, 19:36 - David;: It's like breaking bad all over again
12/02/2019, 19:36 - Sam;: Lol, just fuming at the wall. Rather watch nothing
12/02/2019, 19:36 - David;: Got to disengage
12/02/2019, 19:36 - Paul;: Breaking bad was complete shit
12/02/2019, 19:37 - David;: Yes
12/02/2019, 19:37 - David;: People lost their minds
12/02/2019, 19:37 - Paul;: Oh look everything is purple “wow so clever...best director ever...emotion”
12/02/2019, 19:37 - Phill: >being this butthurt about a show that you actually miss something good
12/02/2019, 19:38 - David;: I just hate buzz
12/02/2019, 19:38 - David;: Anything with buzz can fuck off
12/02/2019, 19:38 - Paul;: Lord of the rings?
12/02/2019, 19:38 - Rob;: Yeah, buzz and quality are not mutually exclusive
12/02/2019, 19:39 - Rob;: You're watching Sex Education. Huge buzz
12/02/2019, 19:39 - David;: But lord of the rings based on a classic novel from 60 years ago that I already knew was good. Not buzz
12/02/2019, 19:39 - David;: Tolkein refused to do interviews. The anti-buzz
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Phill: So edgy
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: Huge buzz
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: The most buzz
12/02/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: You couldn’t be buzzing more
12/02/2019, 19:40 - David;: No buzz. Recommended by fay, had never heard anyone else mention it
12/02/2019, 19:41 - Sam;: Less buzz in a beehive
12/02/2019, 19:41 - Rob;: So basically once the wrong sort of person recommend something to you you're out?
12/02/2019, 19:42 - David;: Yeah that's me gone
12/02/2019, 19:42 - David;: No road back from there
12/02/2019, 19:42 - Rob;: I feel like you need to more proactively seek out stuff or everything will get ruined for you
12/02/2019, 19:43 - David;: I've lost a lot of series this way. West wing.
12/02/2019, 19:44 - David;: Case in point
12/02/2019, 19:44 - Phill: What if you find a programme that is great and then a month later there is massive buzz. Do you suddenly hate it?
12/02/2019, 19:44 - David;: Nah then I'm in it's fine
12/02/2019, 19:45 - Rob;: So if you're in the bandwagon while you thing it's just a regular wagon then you're happy
12/02/2019, 19:45 - Paul;: Is west wing any good though. Never seen it. Maybe it’s just shit like breaking bad and you dodged a bullet
12/02/2019, 19:45 - David;: Yeah probably
12/02/2019, 19:45 - David;: There's a lot of raw shit going around
12/02/2019, 19:45 - Paul;: Lol
12/02/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: What’s on the in list at the moment?
12/02/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: And what is on the disengage?
12/02/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: How did you allow game of thrones to happen to you?
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Mainly documentaries. Your therouxs
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Game of thrones was me and sambo in air froust one
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Then I was in too deep
12/02/2019, 19:47 - David;: Gin and ginger ales.
12/02/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: I’m staring killing Eve episode 1 right now
12/02/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: *starting
12/02/2019, 19:49 - David;: More buzz. Only deters me further
12/02/2019, 19:50 - Paul;: Could we engineer a scenario where you never get to watch anything again?
12/02/2019, 19:50 - Sam;: Yeah yeah yeah. Boozing to game of thrones.
12/02/2019, 19:51 - David;: That was when honkington Moyes was created as well
12/02/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: Sir
12/02/2019, 19:52 - David;: He got broken and just repeated 'i was working under the auspices of sir honkington moyes'
12/02/2019, 19:52 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 19:53 - Sam;: It was between the wars of course
12/02/2019, 19:53 - David;: Lol
12/02/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: How long was he broken for?
12/02/2019, 19:53 - David;: Ah like 3 hours of that I imagine
12/02/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: Lol
12/02/2019, 19:54 - Paul;: “Are you broken”
12/02/2019, 19:54 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/02/2019, 19:57 - Paul;: Killing Eve is just an annoying meme so far
12/02/2019, 19:57 - David;: What I expected
12/02/2019, 19:57 - David;: Predicted as much
12/02/2019, 19:58 - David;: Supporting United then. Feels very wrong and filthy
12/02/2019, 20:02 - Phill: Surprised you're watching the game what with all the buzz
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: Football fine
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: More buzz the better
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: Drama buzz is my issue
12/02/2019, 20:04 - David;: Comedy buzz is okay
12/02/2019, 20:06 - Rob;: I would say that buzz about Killing Eve is at its lowest point now since it came out
12/02/2019, 20:06 - Rob;: That's why it's so odd you've broken now
12/02/2019, 20:07 - David;: It's come to my attention
12/02/2019, 20:08 - Paul;: It’s like being on the generic batman page. So far behind the buzz but still feeling effects of the buzz
12/02/2019, 20:09 - David;: Yeah that's accurate. The buzz gets me late but then I'm furious
12/02/2019, 20:09 - Rob;: Being so underwater makes you so much more vulnerable
12/02/2019, 20:10 - Rob;: When you surface the buzz has spread to people you don't trust
12/02/2019, 20:10 - David;: I'm getting a shitty degraded isotope of the buzz
12/02/2019, 20:14 - David;: Yeah never jump onto a bandwagon, that's a classic rule. But if you happen to find yourself in a bandwagon then fine.
12/02/2019, 20:22 - Rob;: Can you ever come back from it do you think?
12/02/2019, 20:22 - Rob;: Would in say 10 years you able to watch the Wire?
12/02/2019, 20:28 - David;: What even is the wire?
12/02/2019, 20:29 - Rob;: Ah good
12/02/2019, 20:29 - Paul;: Who’s Raul moat
12/02/2019, 20:29 - Phill: Lol
12/02/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: It's a US show about the police and the drug trade in Baltimore. It's slow and incredibly well observed. Examines a different angle of the problem (politics, schools, newspapers etc) in each series.
12/02/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: It's how Idris Elba made his name
12/02/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: Really sucks you in
12/02/2019, 20:31 - Paul;: Sounds like a dangerous amount of buzz for Dave
12/02/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: I deliberately made that as flat as I could
12/02/2019, 20:35 - David;: You lost me at incredibly
12/02/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Stranger things complete shit
12/02/2019, 20:36 - David;: Ah yeah that was classic buzz. Steered well clear
12/02/2019, 20:36 - Rob;: Lol, as a qualifier for observation

http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-47226427
13/02/2019, 16:58 - Damian Rumble: As if Theresa May was not in enough of a jam over Brexit, she has now sparked a debate about how to handle actual jam - the kind that comes in jars.
13/02/2019, 16:58 - Damian Rumble: It comes after she reportedly told cabinet ministers she scrapes the mould off the fruit preserve rather than throw it away.
13/02/2019, 16:58 - Damian Rumble: The SNP's Pete Wishart picked up on PM's comment on Twitter, saying it was "a bit like she runs the Tory Party".

24/02/2019, 15:41 - Sam;: Ince on motd was embarrassing last night. Just watching the clip and saying bosh, have that, thank you very much
24/02/2019, 15:42 - David;: Lol. Analysis. Do they do that in Spain?
24/02/2019, 15:44 - David;: Ince is also looking increasingly like the frog commander thing from star wars
24/02/2019, 15:45 - David;: Admiral Ackbar
24/02/2019, 15:45 - Sam;: Lol.
24/02/2019, 15:45 - David;: And that's not racist
24/02/2019, 15:45 - Sam;: Oh Mo. Taken off
24/02/2019, 15:47 - David;: Has he no influenced the game to be fair
24/02/2019, 15:59 - Sam;: Strange game but I think it suits both teams in the end
24/02/2019, 15:59 - David;: Yeah. It got too big to lose for both.
24/02/2019, 15:59 - David;: Build up killed it

24/02/2019, 17:03 - Phill: You know what this final really makes me want to do, is go out and buy some Carabao.
24/02/2019, 17:12 - David;: Is it basically red bull?
24/02/2019, 17:13 - David;: Does anyone listen to the guardian football weekly where they have that shitty carabao box that they open every time they talk about it
24/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: Yeah it's just shit red bull. Don't know why anyone bothers sponsoring anything.
24/02/2019, 17:15 - Phill: Oooohhh got a real craving for some Carling
24/02/2019, 17:16 - David;: I'm going to go out and just drink pints of milk
24/02/2019, 17:17 - Rob;: Why the fuck didn't the Egg board ever sponsor the cup
24/02/2019, 17:17 - Phill: Fuck competitive rates. I'll be banking with Barclays thank you.
24/02/2019, 17:18 - Rob;: I'm visiting Rwanda because a sleeve told me to
24/02/2019, 17:19 - David;: I currently sit on the cheese board
24/02/2019, 17:24 - David;: Lol and Carabao's slogan is 'the bonkers drink for bonkers lives'
24/02/2019, 17:24 - David;: A word not uttered since 1980
24/02/2019, 17:25 - David;: Same category as zany or wacky
24/02/2019, 19:06 - Sam;: Ridiculous scenes in this game
24/02/2019, 19:07 - Sam;: Kepa refused to be subbed
24/02/2019, 19:07 - Jack G;: He wants to kepan playing
24/02/2019, 19:07 - Rob;: The hubris if he makes a hash of it
24/02/2019, 19:08 - Sam;: Just said no. Sarri fuming. Walked down the tunnel with rage but came back to the bench in the end
24/02/2019, 19:08 - Sam;: Penalties
24/02/2019, 19:10 - Paul;: Peno
24/02/2019, 19:13 - Sam;: Kepa just let one under his body that he should have saved..
24/02/2019, 19:13 - Sam;: After sledging aguero hard

25/02/2019, 09:56 - Rob;: The confidence
25/02/2019, 10:39 - Damian Rumble: Sitting at my desk this morning and I am passed a 'congratulations on your new home' card for a guy who works in a different team to me.... Was so furious at the completely meaningless gesture that I refused to sign it. Who needs to a card full of banal comments from 30 people you don't really know. One person had cared so little he had put 'happy birthday' in there without even reading it!
25/02/2019, 10:39 - Paul;: Lol so much autism
25/02/2019, 10:47 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/02/2019, 10:49 - Damian Rumble: God the women next to me just picked up the card and described it as really cute. Kill me now..

25/02/2019, 11:15 - / James Ball: I've got very mixed feelings. I guess she's a good actor but I can only think of her in peep show
25/02/2019, 11:18 - Rob;: She's great in Tyranosaur
25/02/2019, 12:26 - David;: Yeah she is just Sophie from peep show.
25/02/2019, 12:26 - David;: The favourite is rubbish as well. People don't seem to have picked up on this.
25/02/2019, 13:07 - Jack G;: Looking forward to this new Alan Partridge show later
25/02/2019, 13:41 - / James Ball: Alan Partridge could be great or it could be old and unfunny. Always a problem with comebacks. I'll still watch it though
25/02/2019, 13:41 - Paul;: The film wasn’t that good

You probably do not heard about me and you are probably wondering for what reason you're receiving this message, is it right?
I'm ahacker who burstyour email boxand all devicestwo months ago.
It will be a time wasting to attempt to communicate with me or seek for me, it is definitely not possible, since I directed you an email using YOUR hacked account.
I have build in malware soft on the adult vids (porno) website and suppose that you have watched this website to have a good time (you realize what I want to say).
While you have been keeping an eye on vids, your browser began functioning as a RDP (Remote Control) that have a keylogger that granted me access to your display and webcam.
Afterward, my softwarestoleall info.
You have wrote passwords on the web services you visited, I intercepted them.
Of course, it's possible to change each of them, or possibly already changed them.
But it really does not matter, my malware renews it regularly.
What I have done?
I made a reserve copy of your system. Of all the files and each contact.
I created a dual-screen video. The 1 section shows the video you had been observing (you've got a very good preferences, haha...), and the 2nd part reveals the tape from your camera.
What do you have to do?
Well, I think, 1000 USD will be a good price for our very little riddle. You'll do the deposit by bitcoins (if you don't know this, search “how to buy bitcoin” in any search engine).
My bitcoin wallet address:
1CUmFahadM9fmENHcdepbwSENEdmqh7VeF
(It is cAsE sensitive, so just copy and paste it).
Important:
You will have only 48 hours in order to make the payment. (I built in an unique pixel to this email, and right now I understand that you've read this email).
To tracethe reading of a letterand the actionsin it, I installeda Facebook pixel. Thanks to them. (That whichcan be usedfor the authorities can helpus.)

In the event I do not get bitcoins, I shall immediately transfer your videofile to each of your contacts, along with family members, co-workers, and so forth?
25/02/2019, 13:43 - / James Ball: Thought you might enjoy reading this spam email sent to me. I like the poor english mixed with delicate humour

26/02/2019, 09:27 - Phill: In the two weeks I've been here I've seen him consume nothing more than crisps and biscuits.
26/02/2019, 09:27 - Phill: His lunch yesterday was 8 packets of bacon wheat crunchiest and a tube of Jaffa cakes
26/02/2019, 09:28 - Jack G;: How does he not have Rickets?
26/02/2019, 09:28 - Phill: He then went to the shop and bought a packet of cocktail sausages for an afternoon snack

26/02/2019, 10:53 - David;: Why would you look a ift horse in the mouth?
26/02/2019, 10:53 - David;: Burden of proof is on you
26/02/2019, 10:53 - Rob;: Horse's teeth are the best way to tell a horse's age, but of someone's given it to you for free you shouldn't be questioning how good a gift it is, just accept it
26/02/2019, 10:54 - David;: Just accept your shitty rotten toothed horse and be grateful you cunt
26/02/2019, 11:01 - Damian Rumble: Had a feeling Rooble would know that one

26/02/2019, 18:08 - Rob;: That's mental
26/02/2019, 18:09 - Stefan;: Yeah, it's mostly because of trial dates. Any of them could be cancelled at some point but I just don't know
26/02/2019, 18:32 - Phill: August BH weekend?

28/02/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/02/2019, 20:20 - David;: What is this shit?
28/02/2019, 20:20 - Rob;: Going to get all my cards changed of course
28/02/2019, 20:20 - Rob;: Work bought it for me for a joke
28/02/2019, 20:20 - Rob;: But I can legally be called a lord
28/02/2019, 20:21 - David;: How utterly shit is the piece of land?
28/02/2019, 20:21 - Rob;: We should get one for James but enter Ball in both name fields
28/02/2019, 20:22 - / James Ball: I'd take it
28/02/2019, 20:22 - Rob;: My Cumbrian friend says it's on a nice estate

28/02/2019, 21:47 - Paul;: Please corROBerate
28/02/2019, 21:47 - David;: I do not believe a cat was left in charge of a hotel.
28/02/2019, 22:04 - Phill: OWNAFC: Non-league football club could be run by supporters using a phone app - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47386953
28/02/2019, 22:05 - Phill: <Media omitted>
28/02/2019, 22:11 - Rob;: We got to the castle, got our key from under a flier pot and opened the door. There was a at waiting there for us. It ran up the stairs and waited there. We followed it. It ran up the next flight and waited. Then ran to our bedroom door. We let ourselves in and it let us be for a few minutes while we settled in
28/02/2019, 22:11 - Rob;: It then pawed at the door and we let it in, then when we went to find the kitchen it did the same thing of running ahead and waiting for us to show us the way
28/02/2019, 22:12 - Rob;: Took us back up to our room then left us to sleep
28/02/2019, 22:12 - Paul;: I believe that would be a concierge cat
28/02/2019, 22:12 - Rob;: Woke us up in the morning
28/02/2019, 22:12 - David;: No
28/02/2019, 22:12 - Rob;: Didn't meet the actual owner for another 24 hours
28/02/2019, 22:13 - David;: 'woke us up'
28/02/2019, 22:13 - Rob;: The next night it was waiting at the door
28/02/2019, 22:13 - Rob;: Wanted to come it, was pawing at the door about 9am
28/02/2019, 22:13 - Paul;: Knew they were new
28/02/2019, 22:13 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
28/02/2019, 22:14 - Rob;: It knows whenever new people come in they go to one particular floor where the only two guest rooms are
28/02/2019, 22:15 - Phill: What am I even reading
28/02/2019, 22:15 - David;: Bollocks
28/02/2019, 22:15 - David;: You can't train a cat
28/02/2019, 22:15 - Rob;: Told the owner about its behaviour and he was like 'but there hasn't been a cat here for ten yearrrssss'
28/02/2019, 22:15 - Rob;: The cat just liked people
28/02/2019, 22:16 - David;: But it was charged with showing you to your room?
28/02/2019, 22:17 - Rob;: Well we tipped it heavily so I hope so
28/02/2019, 22:17 - Paul;: Don’t know why everyone so surprised. Cat doing a job
28/02/2019, 22:18 - Rob;: It wasn't teh concierge in an official capacity, no, those are Paul's words. It just ran ahead of you as you walked, knowing where you're likely to be going
28/02/2019, 22:18 - Paul;: That’s a concierge
28/02/2019, 22:18 - David;: Lol, just doing a job of work
28/02/2019, 22:18 - David;: Honest days work for an honest days pay
28/02/2019, 22:19 - Phill: Another day another nip
28/02/2019, 22:20 - David;: How did you realise it was protocol to follow the cat?
28/02/2019, 22:22 - Phill: <Media omitted>
28/02/2019, 22:22 - Rob;: We had some vague directions that confirmed that following the cat was the right thing to do
28/02/2019, 22:22 - David;: <Media omitted>
28/02/2019, 22:23 - David;: This is the cat I'm dealing with at the moment

28/02/2019, 22:24 - David;: One likes to just sit on the TV like a sphinx watching my every move
28/02/2019, 22:24 - Rob;: I'm glad it took us to the kitchen - our room was middle right, and the kitchen is in the basement on the bottom left, and there were no lights on in the whole castle. The level of haunting was insane. We heard a baby that we then never saw or heard any evidence of afterwards
28/02/2019, 22:24 - David;: <Media omitted>
28/02/2019, 22:25 - David;: Not relaxing

04/03/2019, 09:38 - Phill: ✅
04/03/2019, 09:39 - David;: Embarrassing that United fans actively want to be the smallest club in the city. Happy to hand their neighbours the title.

04/03/2019, 19:34 - Sam;: Says it all
04/03/2019, 19:35 - Sam;: Goals per game usually becomes a relevant stat after 10 games played. FYI

07/03/2019, 14:45 - David;: Lol
07/03/2019, 14:46 - Rob;: What's the lowdown on this man, Phil?
07/03/2019, 14:46 - Rob;: People in the office are asking
07/03/2019, 14:46 - Rob;: Name, weight, age, relationship status
07/03/2019, 14:46 - David;: Confident he's single
07/03/2019, 14:47 - Sam;: Bank details
07/03/2019, 14:54 - Phill: Married. Child. Used to be a maths teacher. Early 30's. Damian type build. Long black hair. Thick glasses. Big handlebar beard. Listens to heavy metal.
07/03/2019, 14:54 - Phill: Pretty sound guy just diet is hilarious
07/03/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: That's not what people were betting on
07/03/2019, 14:58 - Phill: Sorry to disappoint
07/03/2019, 14:59 - Phill: He told us this morning that his kid shat in the bath last during bathtime
07/03/2019, 15:01 - David;: Did I no expect a Damian build
07/03/2019, 15:01 - David;: Dat metabolism
07/03/2019, 16:02 - Phill: He's now tucking into a bowl of microwaved scrambled eggs.
07/03/2019, 16:02 - Phill: I shit you not.
07/03/2019, 16:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Can you start a spreadsheet?
07/03/2019, 16:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Then at the end of the month send him a copy
07/03/2019, 16:36 - / James Ball: Does he do a lot of exercise or is he just storing all the calories invisibly in his arteries?
07/03/2019, 16:40 - Rob;: Like Gillian McKeith laying it all out on a table in front of him
07/03/2019, 16:40 - Rob;: Make sure he poos in a bag for you to fondle too
07/03/2019, 18:52 - / James Ball: Really got to rub it through your fingers to get a true appreciation
07/03/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Think he does a bit of exercise
07/03/2019, 18:53 - Phill: He just randomly does 30 pushups sometimes

07/03/2019, 19:44 - David;: Got away from him
07/03/2019, 19:46 - David;: My cousin up here said he drank red bull every day for a year and now he can't drink caffeine without getting anxiety. So had to completely quit it like an alcoholic lol
07/03/2019, 20:11 - Sam;: A Rennes away train
07/03/2019, 20:12 - Sam;: I think there’s been a Rennes up there
07/03/2019, 20:12 - Paul;: Really Renne away from you
07/03/2019, 20:13 - David;: This one could Rennes and Rennes
07/03/2019, 20:13 - Paul;: Alls well that Rennes well
07/03/2019, 20:14 - David;: Rennes will it end?
07/03/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: You’re renning out of time
07/03/2019, 20:17 - David;: All's Well that Rennes Well
07/03/2019, 20:17 - Sam;: Sir Christopher Rennes. (Arsenal are shit)
08/03/2019, 11:12 - David;: Friday slurry Friday
08/03/2019, 11:15 - Sam;: The feel when the last of the days slurry has slid out and you’re ready to gump down a load more shit to fuel tomorrow’s slurry
08/03/2019, 11:16 - Phill: >slurry ever quietly sliding out
08/03/2019, 11:16 - Phill: >not coming out like the shrapnel from a mortar shell

08/03/2019, 11:27 - Sam;: top stories that is
08/03/2019, 11:28 - David;: Have you taken the red pill Sam?
08/03/2019, 11:29 - Sam;: shoved it right up my shneeb
08/03/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: On international Woman's Day as well. Get it everywhere
08/03/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: The oppression is stifling
08/03/2019, 12:28 - Paul;: Did we agree on any 🐋 date?
08/03/2019, 12:29 - Phill: August bank holiday wasn't it?
08/03/2019, 12:29 - Rob;: Good for me
08/03/2019, 12:29 - Phill: Or some point in aug. Just means less leave required if BH.
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: Pate man's lunch
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: 20 eggs
08/03/2019, 13:14 - Phill: Microwave scrambled
08/03/2019, 13:17 - Jack G;: All 20?
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: A good amount of them
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: Just bowls of horrible smelling scrambled egg
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: No sauce
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: No salt
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: No pepper
08/03/2019, 13:21 - Phill: Just egg.
08/03/2019, 13:23 - David;: Is he aware this isn't normal?
08/03/2019, 13:23 - David;: Or is it the elephant in the room
08/03/2019, 13:28 - Phill: He gets abuse for it.
08/03/2019, 13:30 - David;: And doesn't give a fuck? Welcomes their hatred
08/03/2019, 13:31 - Phill: Its that kind of building site banter so it's more playful
08/03/2019, 13:31 - Phill: That the kind of environment I now work in
08/03/2019, 13:32 - Phill: Had someone walking round recently saying everything in an Indian accent. Not Indian.
08/03/2019, 13:32 - David;: So he takes it in good humour
08/03/2019, 13:32 - David;: Ha amazing
08/03/2019, 13:33 - Phill: Yeah yeah. You wouldn't last long here if you couldn't take a bit of banter.
08/03/2019, 13:43 - Paul;: It’s just banter
08/03/2019, 13:47 - Sam;: Pour lighter fluid on keyboard. Light it. It’s just banter
08/03/2019, 13:47 - Sam;: You’ve still got to finish that report though
08/03/2019, 13:47 - Paul;: Slash the tires. Just banter
08/03/2019, 13:48 - Paul;: Bet you thought you’d be going to your child’s school play. Guess again. Just banter
08/03/2019, 13:49 - Sam;: We’ve handcuffed a fire extinguisher to each limb. Just banter
08/03/2019, 13:49 - Paul;: We’ve been putting mercury in your food for months. Just banter
08/03/2019, 14:01 - Phill: So he just got back from the shop with this bag
08/03/2019, 14:01 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 14:01 - Phill: Beef. Monster. Hummus
08/03/2019, 14:03 - Phill: Should probably stop taking photos of his gump
08/03/2019, 14:03 - David;: Dipping sausages in hummus? Quite close
08/03/2019, 14:08 - Paul;: Zero sugar monster though
08/03/2019, 14:09 - David;: Health conscious
08/03/2019, 14:16 - Phill: Zero sugar just means more unknown shit though
08/03/2019, 14:17 - Phill: Give me the sugar mate. At least I know where I stand with it.
08/03/2019, 14:23 - Paul;: Can’t advertise chocolate within 100m of a school - did you know that?
08/03/2019, 14:23 - Paul;: The uk changed
08/03/2019, 14:24 - Jack G;: >advertising chocolate
08/03/2019, 14:24 - David;: Fatties already know about the chocolate
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Jack G;: Everyone’s heard of chocolate and fucking loves it already
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Paul;: Or sugary drinks
08/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: Yeah, it's not lack of information holding back their gorging
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Paul;: Or sweets
08/03/2019, 14:25 - Paul;: Or sausage rolls
08/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: It's their shrivelled will power and gluttony
08/03/2019, 14:26 - Paul;: All those walls ice cream adverts. No more
08/03/2019, 14:26 - Paul;: Had all but forgotten
08/03/2019, 14:27 - David;: Not allowed to advertise weed anywhere. Still seems to be consumed
08/03/2019, 14:27 - David;: Very few Ket adverts around
08/03/2019, 14:36 - Paul;: Definitely a correlation between sales and advertising of chocolate I would have thought
08/03/2019, 14:37 - Sam;: It’s advertising to children specifically that they’re trying to address
08/03/2019, 14:53 - Jack G;: Advertising to children doesn’t seem like a great strategy anyway. Not much disposable income
08/03/2019, 14:54 - Sam;: Ever heard of parents?
08/03/2019, 14:54 - Rob;: Lol
08/03/2019, 14:55 - Jack G;: Then surely target the parents as if it’s something good for the kids. Don’t go direct to the kids?
08/03/2019, 14:55 - Rob;: Teh whole toy industry dismissed
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: I think the reasoning is that when a kid really wants something parents tend to buy it for them
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Paul;: Jack always got adult toys
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: Whereas parents would be more sober in their spending if it was 100% up to them what they bought
08/03/2019, 14:56 - Sam;: Pester power, in advertising terminology
08/03/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: Sorry Jack, I know you wanted an X-wing model, but I've got you a fine leather wallet
08/03/2019, 14:57 - Jack G;: Lol
08/03/2019, 14:57 - Paul;: Jack what was your childhood lol
08/03/2019, 14:59 - Rob;: I know Furbies are all the rage, but here's a set of slate serving boards that I think you'll come to appreciate
08/03/2019, 14:59 - Jack G;: Never got toys, just home accessories and clothes
08/03/2019, 15:00 - Paul;: Of course. Home accessories
08/03/2019, 15:00 - Jack G;: I only had chocolate in mind when making this claim. Realised my mistake as soon as Rob brought up toys
08/03/2019, 15:01 - Phill: Oh you wanted the Game Boy Color? We thought you wanted a coffee table book about Parisian architecture.
08/03/2019, 15:02 - Paul;: Jack, which home accessories were most memorable from your childhood?
08/03/2019, 15:03 - Jack G;: Got a great bedside lamp once, Christmas 1996 was lit
08/03/2019, 15:03 - David;: The word has got out about chocolate. Not a secret
08/03/2019, 15:03 - Rob;: 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏
08/03/2019, 15:03 - Rob;: Played your way out of defense well there
08/03/2019, 15:04 - David;: Also parents famously don't go to school.
08/03/2019, 15:04 - Sam;: Are you broken?
08/03/2019, 15:04 - David;: Targeting the one place pester power will be least effective
08/03/2019, 15:05 - David;: Longest time lag between exposure to advert and point of pester
08/03/2019, 15:05 - Sam;: Because kids have got so much to think about..
08/03/2019, 15:05 - Rob;: But chocolate isn't beyond children's spending power, they get pocket money, can buy a 50p bar
08/03/2019, 15:06 - Sam;: Wake up in a cold sweat, “ I forgot to fucking pester! SSHHHHIIIIITT”
08/03/2019, 15:06 - David;: So it's only because they see the chomp advert that they guzzle anchomp down? Not through seeing the actual chomp in the canteen? Are you broken?
08/03/2019, 15:07 - David;: See chomp, buy chomp. An advert never has to get involved in the school. How many chomp bill boards were just scattered around in chippy school?
08/03/2019, 15:08 - Sam;: Dr David Tangent
08/03/2019, 15:08 - Sam;: Chomp billboards?
08/03/2019, 15:08 - Paul;: Not in schools anymore though are they
08/03/2019, 15:09 - Paul;: How would they know
08/03/2019, 15:09 - David;: They never were. Never saw a chocolate advert in our school. Saw lots of actual chocolate and then bought it
08/03/2019, 15:09 - Paul;: But you don’t get any choc in schools anymore
08/03/2019, 15:09 - Rob;: Near schools not in them
08/03/2019, 15:10 - Rob;: Chippy's a poor example, too rural
08/03/2019, 15:10 - Sam;: See chomp, buy chomp, drink Coca Cola
08/03/2019, 15:10 - Rob;: inner city schools where all the nearby bus stops and tune station carry junk food adverts will have been the target
08/03/2019, 15:10 - David;: All the chomp bill boards down glyme lane?
08/03/2019, 15:11 - Jack G;: All you noobs eating chomps. Curly Wurly way better
08/03/2019, 15:11 - Paul;: >chomp billboard
08/03/2019, 15:11 - Paul;: That’s destroyed me
08/03/2019, 15:12 - Sam;: Build the wall! (In front of the chomp billboard)
08/03/2019, 15:13 - David;: So a fatty is walking to school. Really wants some chocolate. 'oh no I've not seen a chomp advert for 300m. I better just order some lettuce'.
08/03/2019, 15:13 - David;: A bullshit reform
08/03/2019, 15:14 - David;: Nothing at all will be impacted by this.
08/03/2019, 15:14 - Paul;: Just like how sales of cigarettes went up after they stopped advertising them...
08/03/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: Companies wouldn't be buying the adverts if they weren't effective
08/03/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: Probably short term. Far fewer people smoke now
08/03/2019, 15:15 - Paul;: No I mean they obviously went down
08/03/2019, 15:15 - David;: Red Herring. We're already going down due to wider societal changes. Cant establish causality vs correlation
08/03/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: Irony hard to spot in this thread
08/03/2019, 15:15 - David;: *were
08/03/2019, 15:16 - Paul;: The ellipsis rob the ellipsis. Classic irony
08/03/2019, 15:17 - David;: Need to invent a new punctuation mark. The irony mark
08/03/2019, 15:17 - Rob;: You're basically denying the effectiveness of all advertising Dave
08/03/2019, 15:18 - Paul;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - the irony punctuation mark
08/03/2019, 15:18 - David;: Absolutely not. Specifically placed it in the context of junk food and the 300m perimeter making any difference
08/03/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ Dave you cunt ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08/03/2019, 15:19 - David;: https://goo.gl/images/TfgbBi
08/03/2019, 15:19 - David;: Are you able to resist buying one now Rob?
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Paul;: But if it was toys it would work? Only junk food that happens to be exclusively ineffective
08/03/2019, 15:20 - David;: Or you've seen that so there's nothing to be done now
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Rob;: I'm eating one now
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: There’s a big difference between advertising and marketing though
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: Advertising not so effective
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Rob;: This thread is a Chomp dream. Discussing their brand constantly
08/03/2019, 15:20 - Stefan;: Already been done - it's a reversed question mark
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ - this is better
08/03/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: More practical
08/03/2019, 15:21 - David;: A real piece of shit
08/03/2019, 15:22 - Paul;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08/03/2019, 15:22 - Stefan;: I thought that means "don't give a shit"
08/03/2019, 15:25 - Rob;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08/03/2019, 15:25 - Paul;: Idiotic to think that ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08/03/2019, 15:28 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 15:29 - Rob;: Yeah I would be thinking about getting a Chomp if that was suspended above the Albion Tavern
08/03/2019, 15:29 - Rob;: More than another bar, for sure. Look how big it is.
08/03/2019, 15:30 - David;: But you would have seen the actual bar and it's size in the canteen? But the billboard was crucial.
08/03/2019, 15:30 - Rob;: The hippo can't _believe_ the size of that Chomp, David
08/03/2019, 15:30 - Sam;: THEY CANT SELL THEM IN SCHOOLS ANYMORE DAVE
08/03/2019, 15:31 - Jack G;: The chain chomp got me
08/03/2019, 15:40 - David;: I would say toys are less connected to a bodily need or chemical addiction hence marketing somewhat more central to engineering demand vs underlying product design than in junk food markets, yes.
08/03/2019, 15:42 - Phill: DAT new toy buzz doe
08/03/2019, 15:42 - David;: Yeah exactly
08/03/2019, 15:43 - / James Ball: Dat new lamp buzz for Jack
08/03/2019, 15:44 - / James Ball: Ice cream vans also not allowed to set up near schools at home time either
08/03/2019, 15:44 - David;: Ridiculous. Not Mr whippy too?
08/03/2019, 15:45 - Sam;: Dr David Jargon. Marketing Expert
08/03/2019, 15:45 - David;: WHEN WILL IT END?
08/03/2019, 15:46 - Paul;: Really need some damo input into this
08/03/2019, 15:46 - Paul;: He casts aside the thread as all about football
08/03/2019, 15:49 - David;: I mean, doctorate in a fairly closely related subject.
08/03/2019, 15:50 - David;: Not a total layman.
08/03/2019, 15:51 - Sam;: Chomp vs stretch Armstrong marketing?
08/03/2019, 15:51 - David;: There's a lot of economic psychology literature about exactly that sort of thing for different products/sectors.
08/03/2019, 15:54 - Sam;: Yeah I get it, advertising a bigger chomp is more effective than advertising a bigger stretch Armstrong.
08/03/2019, 15:54 - Sam;: NOW WITH A REALISTIC 10 INCHER
08/03/2019, 15:54 - Sam;: STRETCH DICK STRONG
08/03/2019, 15:55 - Sam;: DR DICK STRONG
08/03/2019, 15:55 - David;: I think that was the title of the paper presented to the royal society
08/03/2019, 15:59 - Phill: How do you explain TV ads?
08/03/2019, 15:59 - Phill: BIGGER SCREEN MORE PIXELS MORE DEEP BLACK HIGHER K
08/03/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: I like that TV ads for TVs attempt to show the leap in quality to you on your existing screen
08/03/2019, 16:08 - Rob;: It will look exactly the same as what you were already seeing
08/03/2019, 16:30 - Jack G;: Like the algorithms on shopping websites that recommend the exact same thing that you just bought. No thanks
08/03/2019, 16:30 - Paul;: Damian can you have a word
08/03/2019, 17:45 - Sam;: VAR debate anyone?
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Sam;: I❤VAR
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Sam;: (And petrol)
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Jack G;: Slow motion makes everything look bad
08/03/2019, 17:46 - Jack G;: NEXT
08/03/2019, 17:47 - Sam;: You’ve got to look at the whole clip.
08/03/2019, 17:47 - Sam;: Kimpembe knows what he’s doing when he jumps and turns his body
08/03/2019, 17:48 - Sam;: Arm string outwards whilst turning
08/03/2019, 17:48 - Jack G;: It’s a good concept. Need the refs to get used to it though
08/03/2019, 17:49 - Jack G;: You can imagine Mike Dean dragging out a VAR decision just for the drama
08/03/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: I think they are now. Wednesday highlighted that some of the rules are overly complicated. UEFA said the pen decision is correct according to the rules.
08/03/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: Mike dean was born to VAR
08/03/2019, 17:52 - Jack G;: I agree it was a pen
08/03/2019, 17:52 - Jack G;: Ironic that VAR was brought in to reduce controversy though
08/03/2019, 17:52 - Jack G;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08/03/2019, 17:54 - Sam;: Lol. There was always going to be fine tuning needed. I would say VAR is proving that it’s now the technology that needs fine tuning, it’s the rules and they ways in which they can be interpreted
08/03/2019, 17:55 - Paul;: ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
08/03/2019, 17:55 - Sam;: Imho, expro’s opinions aren’t  valid as it’s like asking an accountant who retired 10 years ago to do your books. Doesn’t know the latest rules
08/03/2019, 17:57 - Jack G;: Yeah it’s the subjective stuff that VAR isn’t great at. Handball, tackles where intent for the ball isn’t clear. Also how far back in play do you take the video clips
08/03/2019, 17:58 - Jack G;: Sorry your goal is ruled out because Aguero got fouled at 36 minutes which led to a free kick which led to the corner that the counter attack was launched from which ended in a penalty
08/03/2019, 17:58 - Sam;: Well I just meant about 5 frames back rather than a still on the moment it touches the arm
08/03/2019, 17:59 - Sam;: Just to fuck everyone up even further, apparently, if United had taken a quick corner then the VAR review becomes null and void.
08/03/2019, 18:00 - Sam;: Quick free kick/corners are penalised. Have to choose that or VAR review
08/03/2019, 18:00 - Jack G;: Maybe it should be like tennis where both teams get two VAR reviews per half
08/03/2019, 18:01 - Phill: It's gone too VAR in my opinion.
08/03/2019, 18:01 - Sam;: Too slow though. In tennis a single player decides for themselves. Are the coaching staff going deliberate before using a VAR call
08/03/2019, 18:02 - Jack G;: Football clubs would start employing VAR analysts
08/03/2019, 18:04 - Jack G;: In rugby it’s all on the refs and TMO. So the TMO is constantly reviewing the match footage and flags stuff up for the ref to review. Works really well
08/03/2019, 18:05 - Sam;: That’s the way VAR is though. Rugby rules are clearer and less subjective
08/03/2019, 18:13 - Jack G;: Also you don’t get the players kicking off at the ref. Need to stamp that out
08/03/2019, 18:16 - David;: Think they should introduce challenges like in tennis. Teams start with 3 challenges and captain can send a decision to review. Lose it if onfield decision was right. Keeps a lid on it being used for trivial shit and takes away subjectivity of ref in when to call for it.
08/03/2019, 18:18 - David;: Ah just read up and Jack just said that
08/03/2019, 18:18 - David;: Void. I lose a challenge
08/03/2019, 18:19 - Sam;: In football would you give challenge rights to the captain or manager? How do you prevent conferring
08/03/2019, 18:19 - David;: Captain
08/03/2019, 18:19 - David;: And has to do it within e.g. 10 seconds of incident
08/03/2019, 18:20 - Sam;: Makes sense, he’s on the pitch, so closer
08/03/2019, 18:20 - David;: So reduced scope for conferral
08/03/2019, 18:20 - Sam;: Can take quick opinion from teammates
08/03/2019, 18:20 - David;: Also like the idea of giving captain role more meaning again
08/03/2019, 18:20 - Sam;: Yeah defo
08/03/2019, 18:22 - Sam;: Although I’m conflicted between the idea of conveying value to a challenge by limiting number and the purist intent of reducing bad decision. You could be out of challenges, then a big incident comes up
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Rob;: I think every player needs a drone cam permanently 1 ft above their heads
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Rob;: 22 drones, plus ref and lino drones
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Sam;: Perfect
08/03/2019, 18:23 - Sam;: Lino drone jr
08/03/2019, 18:24 - Sam;: Lino di capridrone
08/03/2019, 18:24 - Rob;: Short players drones would be at eye height for larger players
08/03/2019, 18:24 - David;: Broken
08/03/2019, 18:25 - Sam;: Derp Blunderdrone
08/03/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: Welcome to the Blunderdome
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Sam;: Big fan of shipyard pale ale these days. Nice half way house between larger and ale
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Yeah it's one of the nicer ones you find on tap a lot
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: I really dislike Five Points
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: See that too much
08/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Beavertown Neckoil is great
08/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Mosaic is good too
08/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: Honking on this. Great little imported lager my local supermarket does
08/03/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Candy cane/barbershop vibe
08/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: They've just done lager. Worked it out. Don't need to drink any other now
08/03/2019, 18:30 - Sam;: Must be a Scotland special. Not seen it in the UK
08/03/2019, 18:30 - Sam;: you’ll have to smuggle some back
08/03/2019, 18:30 - Sam;: If you can get over Hadrian’s wall with it
08/03/2019, 18:30 - David;: Yeah yeah, they stick different stuff here. Newcastle brown everywhere
08/03/2019, 18:30 - David;: *stock
08/03/2019, 18:31 - David;: I believe you could describe this as a crisp pint. Very crisp.
08/03/2019, 18:32 - Rob;: The crispiest liquid going
08/03/2019, 18:32 - Sam;: I 💓 crisp. How’s the flavour?
08/03/2019, 18:33 - David;: Fruity, slightly citrus vibe
08/03/2019, 18:33 - Sam;: Ooof. I’m gurning over that
08/03/2019, 18:33 - David;: But without the cloying fruitiness when they overdo it chasing the hipsters
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Like Brewdog Elvis Juice
08/03/2019, 18:34 - David;: Where I may as well just be drinking grapefruit juice
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: Did i no want to drink 6.5% lilt
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Lel. Alcoholic umbongo please
08/03/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Umbongo and snake bite
08/03/2019, 18:36 - Rob;: I'm a big fan of the craft beer trend in the way that it's led to tiny cornershops stocking loads of different beers on permanent 3 for £X deals. It's fun just rinsing a few on a Friday night and seeing what's good
08/03/2019, 18:36 - Sam;: Yeah, not just krony or Stella on offer
08/03/2019, 18:37 - Sam;: (Though I 💗 Stella obvs)
08/03/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Not a fan of anything much over 5% really in the craft world
08/03/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Let me taste the beer not the alcohol
08/03/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: Yeah piss lager has its place. A deathly cold Stella on a sweltering day  slakes thirst like no other
08/03/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: You don't want a porter at beach
08/03/2019, 18:38 - Hamish Sinclair: This is fine until you realise 90% are shit. Once you find a nice one it's difficult to not just want to continue gumping that
08/03/2019, 18:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Another gamma ray please
08/03/2019, 18:39 - Rob;: I've had some better odds than that, but some are shit
08/03/2019, 18:40 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 18:50 - David;: Not on board with this small IPA cans thing - brewdog etc.
08/03/2019, 18:51 - David;: American beer culture is so shit - really strong 7% ipas everywhere.
08/03/2019, 18:52 - Rob;: Yeah strong is shit
08/03/2019, 18:52 - David;: Agreed, it improves so much having been chilled for like 3 days.
08/03/2019, 18:53 - David;: When you find one on Sunday that's been sitting there since the Friday sesh
08/03/2019, 18:53 - David;: Chilled to within an inch of it's life
08/03/2019, 18:53 - Sam;: Are we all agreed that Sergio Ramos’ week has been great for everyone
08/03/2019, 18:53 - David;: Yeah yeah very entertaining
08/03/2019, 18:54 - David;: The thing about him making a doccy about himself as they were crashing out
08/03/2019, 18:54 - David;: Partly due to his own fuck up with the card
08/03/2019, 18:54 - Sam;: So delicious. Not sure I can take another bite
08/03/2019, 18:54 - Sam;: So full of his hubris
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: Gloucester gold
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: 3.9%
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: A real gumping ale
08/03/2019, 19:03 - Phill: Explaining to Becca the concept of a guzzling beer
08/03/2019, 19:04 - Phill: She drinks so slowly. Smashed 3 pints in the time it's taken her to drink   three quarters of a pint.
08/03/2019, 19:04 - Phill: She doesn't understand that some beer is brewed to.guzzle.
08/03/2019, 19:05 - David;: She's unwilling to guzzle?
08/03/2019, 19:05 - David;: Would she drink a strong beer at the same rate as a weak one or is there some variation?
08/03/2019, 19:06 - Phill: Same rate.
08/03/2019, 19:06 - Phill: Always.
08/03/2019, 19:08 - Rob;: I had two Doombars in 45 mins at lunch. It just slips down you
08/03/2019, 19:08 - Phill: Drinks wine at the same rate
08/03/2019, 19:09 - Rob;: Doesn't actually sound fast at all, but what I mean is I was barely aware i'd drunk them
08/03/2019, 19:09 - David;: Fan of doombar
08/03/2019, 19:44 - Paul;: Pomegranates in salads. Can I get a consensus
08/03/2019, 19:44 - David;: No
08/03/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Grit/10.
08/03/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Just in Tesco's semi pissed with Becca.
08/03/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Talking about pudding.
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: She sees an ad for mini eggs.
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: "let's get mini eggs"
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: I say
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: " do you actually want mini eggs or is it because of the ad?"
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: She decides it's because of the ad.
08/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: Explain?
08/03/2019, 19:52 - Paul;: She’s not a child though. Adults easily swayed
08/03/2019, 19:52 - Phill: Ah.
08/03/2019, 19:55 - David;: So was she just not guzzling because driving back?
08/03/2019, 19:55 - Phill: Ah no with her mum who is driving
08/03/2019, 19:57 - David;: Lol good to discuss how fast you guzzle booze in front of the in-laws
08/03/2019, 19:58 - Phill: No biggie. Me Becca and her mum stayed up until 6am drinking spirits and smoking this Christmas.
08/03/2019, 19:58 - David;: Bants
08/03/2019, 19:58 - Phill: Chatting shit.
08/03/2019, 19:58 - David;: That's ideal
08/03/2019, 20:00 - Phill: Such a rank hangover the next day though. Vomming and shitting.
08/03/2019, 20:01 - David;: We got of lightly after sambos considering how much we guzzled
08/03/2019, 20:01 - David;: Good night
08/03/2019, 20:02 - Phill: Ruined boxing day.
08/03/2019, 20:08 - David;: Was watching a YouTube video of a girlfriend reviewing her boyfriend playing different games. So the meta review of watching someone else playing and how pleasant/annoying it is as a back seat gamer
08/03/2019, 20:08 - Phill: Yeah. Guzzling the pastis. Hope Tony and Judith didn't mind.
08/03/2019, 20:09 - Phill: Backseating the backseater.
08/03/2019, 20:09 - David;: *channel
08/03/2019, 20:09 - Phill: "you shouldn't review it like this. This is how to review this"
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Phill: New gervais on Netflix.
08/03/2019, 20:25 - Phill: "peado"
08/03/2019, 20:26 - David;: It's called peado?
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: "peado? I'm not a peado. If I was, you'd be safe you tubby little ginger cunt"
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Nah it's called after life.
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Reviewing it now.
08/03/2019, 20:26 - Phill: It's in the balance. But some good lines so far.
08/03/2019, 20:27 - David;: Ah good let me know how it pans out
08/03/2019, 20:32 - Phill: Want to hate it but it's actually alright.
08/03/2019, 20:32 - David;: Gervais not being a self absorbed cunt in it?
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Not so much.
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: It feels like he's playing an actual character this time
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Rather than just being Gervais
08/03/2019, 20:34 - Phill: I mean it is Gervais.
08/03/2019, 20:35 - Phill: Got a few Extras and Office actors in
08/03/2019, 20:40 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2019, 21:12 - Phill: 3 episodes in
08/03/2019, 21:12 - Phill: Worth a watch tbh
08/03/2019, 22:17 - David;: Ah cunk is involved
08/03/2019, 22:17 - David;: Pretty good so far
08/03/2019, 22:41 - David;: Merchant has that new wrestling film out as well
08/03/2019, 23:43 - David;: He's still using jokes that came up in the pilkington shows
09/03/2019, 11:16 - David;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JR8zpEwR7js
09/03/2019, 11:16 - David;: Revisited. Such utter shit.
09/03/2019, 11:17 - David;: Presenter must have been on heavy drugs
09/03/2019, 11:17 - Phill: It's a personification of my brain on Mandy, balloons, ket and weed.
09/03/2019, 11:18 - Rob;: Did Pat Sharp come to you unis as well? Gave an incredibly uncomfortable low-budget fun house spoof in the middle of a night out
09/03/2019, 11:20 - David;: The obligatory forced scream after anything happens
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Phill: I regret the slow phasing out of gunge in TV
09/03/2019, 11:22 - David;: Yeah same
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: Yeah
09/03/2019, 11:22 - David;: There must have been one company that made all the gunge and went bust or something
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Phill: Sharp definitely fucking Melanie and Martina backstage
09/03/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: A public gunging would be a great punishment
09/03/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: Get Shamima Begun a good gunging and get on with it
09/03/2019, 11:23 - David;: It was just a classic show finale.
09/03/2019, 11:23 - David;: Mess, chaos and humiliation
09/03/2019, 11:24 - Phill: Always big build up to the gunging.
09/03/2019, 11:24 - Phill: CRANK IT UUUUPPPP
09/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: Yes and then often quite slow and underwhelming delivery mechanism
09/03/2019, 11:24 - Rob;: The general election should have the main leaders in gunge tanks as they collect the votes. Only the new prime minister stays dry
09/03/2019, 11:28 - David;: Lol, 10.15. 'dumbbell', 'dumb blonde'.
09/03/2019, 11:28 - David;: Of its time
09/03/2019, 12:29 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
09/03/2019, 12:40 - David;: M23 derby then

09/03/2019, 13:04 - David;: Need a Brighton win for my accy
09/03/2019, 13:04 - David;: £2,200 if today's results go my way
09/03/2019, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Living in a murray wonderland
09/03/2019, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: He hates palace
09/03/2019, 13:06 - David;: Wash you mouth out son, go get your father's gun, and shoot the palace scum, shoot the palace scum.
09/03/2019, 13:06 - David;: You feel we need it more than palace
09/03/2019, 14:02 - Hamish Sinclair: A goals been scored there
09/03/2019, 14:02 - Hamish Sinclair: HONK HONK HONK
09/03/2019, 14:05 - David;: Fuck off

09/03/2019, 14:07 - David;: Doing a nice grotty number here
09/03/2019, 14:23 - David;: Dunk for England
09/03/2019, 14:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Dave what else in your accy ?
09/03/2019, 14:24 - David;: Ah well, so draw between Southampton Spurs is the biggest gamble
09/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: Then city to win later. Draw toon v Everton, draw leicester v Fulham, win for west ham v cardiff
09/03/2019, 14:26 - David;: And Bournemouth beating Huddersfield.
09/03/2019, 14:26 - David;: Easy
09/03/2019, 14:26 - David;: All sounds so plausible
09/03/2019, 14:30 - David;: I could cash in now for a 32p profit. But why would I do that when I'm about to win £2,200?
09/03/2019, 15:55 - Jack G;: Should have taken the 32p
09/03/2019, 15:56 - David;: Yeah 32p looking like a great deal now
09/03/2019, 15:56 - Jack G;: Could get a chomp with that
09/03/2019, 15:57 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
09/03/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Spurs
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Jack G;: Very spursy
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: The title challenge
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Jack G;: Would be funny if they came 6th in a 3 horse race
09/03/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: Just little away trips to Liverpool and City to come
09/03/2019, 16:53 - Rob;: I suppose only one of United and Arsenal can gain 3 points of them tomorrow
09/03/2019, 16:55 - Jack G;: Pocchetino to Real Madrid please. Really damage them
09/03/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: Trying out Fleabag. Seems complete shit initially. 1 minute in
09/03/2019, 19:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah nah nah
09/03/2019, 19:52 - Hamish Sinclair: It's great
09/03/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: Turned it off
09/03/2019, 19:54 - Hamish Sinclair: You've pulled a shocker
09/03/2019, 20:00 - Phill: It's shit.
09/03/2019, 20:00 - Phill: 0/10
09/03/2019, 20:01 - Phill: It's like watching a foreign comedy. Too London based.
09/03/2019, 20:43 - / James Ball: I'm also not keen. Funny moments but I would say 4/10
09/03/2019, 21:01 - David;: I didn't love it 6.5/10
09/03/2019, 21:32 - / James Ball: π/10
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes it's set in london
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Only fools and horses - too London centric
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Phill: Precisely.
09/03/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: The office - too slough centric
09/03/2019, 22:28 - Phill: The vibe.
09/03/2019, 22:28 - Phill: London is its own country. Like watching a Somalian comedy. No references. Sorry.
09/03/2019, 22:29 - Phill: The little third person/first person intersections wind me.
09/03/2019, 22:30 - Phill: Very London.
09/03/2019, 22:33 - Phill: Just staring at the word London after half a bottle of whiskey.
09/03/2019, 22:33 - Phill: Looks odd.
09/03/2019, 22:33 - Phill: >the brain

10/03/2019, 17:18 - Phill: The bounce is bounced.
10/03/2019, 17:24 - Rob;: Good match
10/03/2019, 17:24 - Rob;: But hard to enjoy. I hate big games
10/03/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: Notice-period Ramsey is still a good Ramsey
10/03/2019, 17:27 - David;: Makes it even more troll
10/03/2019, 17:29 - Rob;: I don't really mind the whole thing. I don't think we can pay him 400k a week, he's still putting the effort in while he's with us, good luck to him
10/03/2019, 17:30 - Paul;: Who on earth is paying him £400k a week
10/03/2019, 17:30 - Rob;: Juventus, from June
10/03/2019, 17:30 - David;: That is madness
10/03/2019, 17:31 - David;: A decent but inconsistent centre mid
10/03/2019, 17:31 - David;: With an injury history
10/03/2019, 17:33 - Paul;: Never hear anything about him being good. Just always injured
10/03/2019, 17:33 - David;: How much is Ronaldo on?
10/03/2019, 17:34 - Sam;: Still worth 40/50 million. It just means he gets the money not arsenal. Classic miss management of contracts by arsenal
10/03/2019, 17:37 - David;: Lol Ronaldo gets £540,000
10/03/2019, 17:37 - David;: Not even that much more than little aaron
10/03/2019, 17:59 - Phill: The 400k a week is only because they don't have to buy him off anyone
10/03/2019, 17:59 - David;: Penalty jeff
10/03/2019, 17:59 - Sam;: Scored
10/03/2019, 17:59 - Sam;: Never a pen
10/03/2019, 18:00 - Jack G;: Olé’s bubble has burst
10/03/2019, 18:00 - Rob;: Always a goal
10/03/2019, 18:01 - Jack G;: Pushed Lacazette over
10/03/2019, 18:06 - Rob;: Pogba should be off then if the ref had seen his head grab earlier
10/03/2019, 18:11 - David;: 'it would have taken them 30 minutes to get Paris out of their legs'
10/03/2019, 18:11 - David;: Sports science
10/03/2019, 18:14 - Sam;: Slight touch from Fred. Don’t know how lacazette suddenly looses the use of legs from a hand on the Lower back
10/03/2019, 23:24 - David;: Sari embarrassing himself now
10/03/2019, 23:26 - David;: Disrespectful - he must be gone end of season

11/03/2019, 15:39 - Jack G;: Zidane 2, electric boogaloo
11/03/2019, 15:50 - David;: Embarrassing for them
11/03/2019, 15:51 - David;: Not sure it will work given squad needs overhauling and new identity - he's not the person to do that
11/03/2019, 16:07 - Sam;: Strange that he wants back in. Made a call to bounce. Maybe the bunch is big, or maybe they’ll actually let a manager have a say on the players he coaches

11/03/2019, 22:08 - Rob;: Sounds like she might have got a way out of the backstop
11/03/2019, 22:09 - Jack G;: Disappointing season finale
11/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Does it?
11/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Nothing concrete on BBC news being announced, just talks
11/03/2019, 22:14 - Jack G;: It could still be a load of bollocks just to try and force the deal through tomorrow
11/03/2019, 22:29 - Jack G;: Yep. Looks like they were over selling it. Lots of MPs not buying it and still unhappy
12/03/2019, 00:21 - David;: Fleabag not that funny

12/03/2019, 08:47 - David;: Didn't one of his central arguments about information loss get discredited?
12/03/2019, 11:12 - Jack G;: Attorney General has said his previous legal advice remains unchanged. The deal is dead now surely?
12/03/2019, 11:15 - Phill: So the guy at work who gumps pate has one of those rubber bracelets on. Instead of LIVESTRONG on, it just says: DONER KEBAB. WHEN DO YOU EAT YOURS?
12/03/2019, 11:15 - Phill: You can't make this shit up.
12/03/2019, 11:17 - David;: Lol. >those rubber bracelets.
12/03/2019, 11:17 - David;: Very 2003
12/03/2019, 11:42 - David;: Butt blow for May
12/03/2019, 11:42 - Jack G;: I can see her attempting to pull the vote again now
12/03/2019, 13:04 - David;: Cox's Codpiece
12/03/2019, 14:02 - David;: Will be funny if no deal is rejected but extension is rejected
12/03/2019, 14:04 - Damian Rumble: May, "look we got the deal you wanted"

Cox, "lol only joking, it's still a piece of shit"
12/03/2019, 14:05 - Jack G;: Yeah May got fucked by Cox there
12/03/2019, 14:05 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
12/03/2019, 14:08 - David;: May sounding very haggard
12/03/2019, 14:08 - David;: Broken, simply dissolved
12/03/2019, 14:16 - Jack G;: I think she’s finally at the end of the line
12/03/2019, 14:17 - David;: We've said that before
12/03/2019, 14:18 - Jack G;: She doesn’t have anywhere to go now though. The vote will lose later, she can’t renegotiate anymore. She’s said she doesn’t want no deal or no brexit. She’s put herself in a lonely, dark corner
12/03/2019, 14:18 - David;: She'll just plow on with an extension
12/03/2019, 14:19 - David;: But difficult to see what that will acheive if EU refuse to open more talks
12/03/2019, 14:19 - Jack G;: But the EU gets to say how long any extension will be. Her Brexiteers will be pissed
12/03/2019, 14:20 - David;: It will likely be 3 months to avoid elections. And she could concoct some way of selling that as a way to renegotiate yet again.
12/03/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: No way the EU accept that. They want something substantial like a referendum, general election or dropping of her red lines to consider an extension?
12/03/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: They'll be unlikely to extend past 23 May because of the parliament elections. Unless her government falls.
12/03/2019, 14:22 - David;: She could say she'll go Norway and pivot away from ERG to peel off labour votes. But hard to see her wanting to do that
12/03/2019, 14:22 - David;: Think EU would accept extension if that was how presented however
12/03/2019, 14:22 - Stefan;: Any option she goes for will split her party, perhaps permanently
12/03/2019, 14:22 - Stefan;: Which could be the one upside of Brexit
12/03/2019, 14:23 - Jack G;: Embarrassing for her though if she’s wasted this long on her deal and it turns out she should have gone for a Norway type deal all along
12/03/2019, 14:23 - Sam;: Vice chair of 1922 committee says defeat will definitely lead to a general election.
12/03/2019, 14:23 - David;: They always close ranks when it poses an electoral threat though - e.g. backing her in Jan.
12/03/2019, 14:24 - Sam;: Old Charlie Walker warning of a genny
12/03/2019, 14:24 - David;: Lol, a genny
12/03/2019, 14:25 - Sam;: I’ve got Shadow world in the 4.20 at aintree and Corbyn in the genny
12/03/2019, 14:25 - David;: by what mechanism? They've already fluffed it by mounting leadership challenge in December so cannot do again for a year now
12/03/2019, 14:26 - Sam;: Is genny process different to a leady challo though? Or same
12/03/2019, 14:26 - Jack G;: More defections from the party so that she has no majority even with the DUP
12/03/2019, 14:27 - David;: Can be the same if the new leader choses to seek a mandate. Otherwise yes can be done through motion of confy in the old government. But that would be pretty mental.
12/03/2019, 14:28 - David;: Could be a conservative-led confy motion in the gov, but pretty insane to have that against a government from your own party, and they already supported her in one only a month ago
12/03/2019, 14:30 - Jack G;: The TIGs would be screwed in a genny
12/03/2019, 14:31 - David;: haha
12/03/2019, 14:36 - Damian Rumble: I heard a rumor that may is considering rolling the GE dice once again. Would make sense as her party is fucked at moment and... In spite of that... The Tories have opened up a bit of a lead in the polls. Could use it to get her MPs to stand on the mandate of delivering her deal or fuck off if they don't want it.
12/03/2019, 14:36 - Jack G;: The public hate her deal though, risky strategy
12/03/2019, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: Not as much as they hate Corbyn though
12/03/2019, 14:39 - David;: More to the point, her party membership are all mental brexiteers so the selection process would result in a more brexity cohort of MPs
12/03/2019, 14:40 - Phill: CLIFF EDGE CLIFF EDGE CLIFF EDGE
12/03/2019, 14:45 - David;: Also May has already promised not to stand as leader in the next general election. So she'd have to go back on that somehow.
12/03/2019, 14:45 - Jack G;: I think she worded that cleverly though to say she won’t stand in the 2021 election
12/03/2019, 14:45 - Damian Rumble: I mean she had no problem going back on her first promise not to hold a general election in 2017
12/03/2019, 14:48 - David;: Yes but that was vaguely to the country and this was to her party so brexiters would be pissed.
12/03/2019, 14:48 - David;: She might say something like i'll fight it to gain popular mandate for deal and then step aside.
12/03/2019, 14:51 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I guess... I just wish we had a mechanism in which she could put a single issue to the public and get them make a binary choice to determine how to proceed...
12/03/2019, 14:52 - Jack G;: “But having a second vote is undemocraric” she says whilst repeatedly bringing her deal back to the house
12/03/2019, 14:55 - Phill: Damo. You lost the referendum. Stop crying about it. God.
12/03/2019, 19:51 - Phill: <Media omitted>
12/03/2019, 23:34 - Damian Rumble: May's voice when announcing the votes coming tomorrow. Like a death rattle...
13/03/2019, 07:38 - / James Ball: She's had a death rattle for a few years to be fair
13/03/2019, 10:00 - Sam;: Big game tonight. To have 4 English teams in the QF would be big. Returning to dominating Europe again like the mid 2000’s.
13/03/2019, 10:00 - Hamish Sinclair: Odds don't look good though
13/03/2019, 10:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Bayern have turned good all of a sudden
13/03/2019, 10:02 - Sam;: Yeah, they showed very little in the first leg though.
13/03/2019, 10:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Apparently they've made it to 7 of the last 8 Semi finals
13/03/2019, 10:03 - Sam;: Weeeeell.
13/03/2019, 10:03 - Hamish Sinclair: If Liverpool do get through, I bet all 4 English teams play each other
13/03/2019, 10:04 - Sam;: Ah so this is the first time since 10/11 season that there will be at least 3 English teams in the QF. 

On the flip side, if they do play each other it guarantees 2 in the SF
13/03/2019, 10:05 - Hamish Sinclair: As long as city don't win it in happy
13/03/2019, 10:07 - Jack G;: Yeah Pep saying he wants Bayern to go through was a bit unnecessary
13/03/2019, 10:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Hadn't seen that, prick
13/03/2019, 10:08 - Rob;: Surely he'd prefer Liverpool to have more Champions League games to concentrate on
13/03/2019, 10:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Love watching city and psg desperately throw money at champions league. Hopefully if some one can just beat them this season, they nay be banned by next season
13/03/2019, 14:33 - Jack G;: 6 fullbacks in this England squad seems excessive
13/03/2019, 14:35 - David;: Is it cause he seems to think Kyle walker is a centre back?
13/03/2019, 14:35 - Jack G;: Possibly. Also, Trippier over Wan-Bissika is a terrible decision
13/03/2019, 14:37 - Phill: I've heard of Wan-Bissaka, not Wan-Bissika
13/03/2019, 14:40 - David;: Trippier dining off the world cup buzz though
13/03/2019, 14:40 - David;: It's fair enough, you get a year after scoring a blooter in a semi
13/03/2019, 14:40 - Sam;: Full back to the future
13/03/2019, 14:42 - David;: The Full Back Monty
13/03/2019, 14:42 - David;: Full Back Metal Jacket
13/03/2019, 14:46 - Jack G;: How Stella got her fullback
13/03/2019, 17:12 - Sam;: Lel. Watching van gaal greatest hits and deep cuts. 

Mike smalling happened twice. Also called another player mike as well (Will Keane)
13/03/2019, 17:18 - Jack G;: Would watch, he’s great entertainment

13/03/2019, 17:47 - Jack G;: This was also a highlight
13/03/2019, 19:18 - Jack G;: They tried to make me go for no deal. I said no, no, no
13/03/2019, 20:17 - Phill: I don't get this shitty amendment.
13/03/2019, 20:17 - Phill: "we don't want no deal"
13/03/2019, 20:17 - Phill: You will been saying that for 2 years.
13/03/2019, 20:18 - Phill: Need a nice little civil war to flare up.
13/03/2019, 20:29 - Sam;: That is a quality goal from Man E
13/03/2019, 20:29 - Hamish Sinclair: The van dijk assist
13/03/2019, 20:29 - David;: He's taken a touch there
13/03/2019, 20:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Has given me a massive boner
13/03/2019, 20:30 - David;: A real piece of touch
13/03/2019, 21:18 - Damian Rumble: I don't know much about football but this is a really poor quality game
13/03/2019, 21:29 - Sam;: Ooooooo
13/03/2019, 21:29 - Sam;: And Lyon have a goal too!
14/03/2019, 10:26 - David;: Child sex abuse victims have criticised Boris Johnson for claiming police funding was being "spaffed up the wall" investigating historical allegations.

The Tory MP said in an interview with LBC that "an awful lot of police time" was spent looking at "historic offences and all this malarkey".
14/03/2019, 10:26 - David;: Courting the pro-peado vote.
14/03/2019, 10:27 - David;: Always a risky strategy
14/03/2019, 10:27 - Stefan;: Yeah but you can't please both the pro- and anti-paedo crowds
14/03/2019, 10:27 - Stefan;: Got to pick a side
14/03/2019, 10:29 - David;: Good to use the term spaffing in the context of sex abuse as well
14/03/2019, 10:34 - Phill: <Media omitted>
14/03/2019, 10:36 - Phill: <Media omitted>
14/03/2019, 11:24 - Sam;: seen this point  a lot this week - "Everyone raving about 50% English teams still in Europe. How many English players in the match-day squads? 5/18 Liverpool. 4/18 Tottenham. 6/18 United. 5/18 City. Poor."

So there's 20 english players in the knockout stage of the top competition in Europe? a national tourny squad is 23 - the proportion is irrelevant for me just the number
14/03/2019, 11:25 - Sam;: and some in the europa league as well with chelsea and arsenal
14/03/2019, 11:26 - Paul;: Are you butthurt?
14/03/2019, 11:27 - Damian Rumble: A very astute point
14/03/2019, 11:36 - David;: Yes, also people not putting that in comparative context. E.g. PSG first XI was only about 4 French players. None of Barcelona front 3 Spanish, in fact only 4 Spanish players in Barcelona first team last night, same number as in united team vs PSG.
14/03/2019, 11:36 - David;: In other words, that's bollocks
14/03/2019, 11:38 - David;: Only 3 Italian players in Juve starting team vs Athletico
14/03/2019, 11:43 - Sam;: Livid. Haters in the forums.
14/03/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: It's looking at the problem the wrong way around. Perhaps more English footballers should play abroad
14/03/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: So it's the foreign clubs' fault really
14/03/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Buy our players
14/03/2019, 11:51 - Sam;: Yeah, German clubs seem to be going for English youngsters the days. The Sancho effect
14/03/2019, 11:53 - David;: What you need is overall breakdown of all first XIs in the quarter final matches by nationality.
14/03/2019, 11:56 - David;: That's the relevant stat. Because also match day squad misleading because bench often has more up and coming academy products etc., doesn't mean they are necessarily key players. Mason Greenwood being on the United bench should not have the same weighting as Harry Kane being a nailed on starter.
14/03/2019, 11:59 - Phill: Why so nationalist?
14/03/2019, 11:59 - David;: Want England to win the world cup ennit
14/03/2019, 12:00 - Sam;: Obvs

15/03/2019, 11:23 - David;: Fuck, either of those would be a massive semi if we get through
15/03/2019, 11:23 - David;: That semi is giving me a semi
15/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: Obvs City get spurs. Their draws are a fucking joke.
15/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: City Juve in the semis would be big though. Imagine City vs Juve and Liverpool vs United.
15/03/2019, 11:25 - David;: Scope
15/03/2019, 11:27 - Sam;: i want city dead. spurs juve is my pic

15/03/2019, 12:13 - Rob;: Did I no want Napoli
15/03/2019, 13:16 - Jack G;: Not too bad. You either knock out a top contender or you get eliminated and can concentrate on top 4
15/03/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Jeremy from Peep Show's plan of becoming a millionaire by selling the headline Three-0 Walcott to the media will finally come to pass tonight at midnight

15/03/2019, 19:18 - Rob;: It's a bit in Peep Show
15/03/2019, 19:19 - Rob;: Jeremy thinks he'll make millions with the headline 3-0 Walcott when Theo Walcott turns 30
15/03/2019, 19:19 - Rob;: He turns 30 at midnight
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Paul;: What are you doing to celebrate?
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: What's that got to do with the scoreline of 3-0?
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: That's the wordplay
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: Not that he's 30
15/03/2019, 19:20 - Phill: Unless I'm too pissed to see this
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: Three Oh is a shot pun on Theo
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Phill: Yeah
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Phill: So related to goals
15/03/2019, 19:21 - Phill: Not age
15/03/2019, 19:22 - Rob;: The big Three Oh is a way some people describe turning 30
15/03/2019, 19:23 - Rob;: There's nothing more to it than that, it's meant to be shit
15/03/2019, 19:23 - Phill: This gave me cancer.

15/03/2019, 20:56 - Phill: Lol how does Ronaldo have more goals than Messi
15/03/2019, 20:56 - Phill: The face when the narrative has led you believe that Messi is the GOAT

15/03/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Older though

15/03/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: When Ronaldo is ded Messi will goal
15/03/2019, 21:01 - David;: At all equivalent ages Messi is ahead
15/03/2019, 21:13 - Phill: Nah Messi ded.
15/03/2019, 21:14 - Phill: Latest episode of partridge is 9/10

15/03/2019, 21:23 - Phill: Fuck this.
15/03/2019, 21:23 - Phill: I'm out
15/03/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: Are you broken
15/03/2019, 21:26 - David;: Lol yeah I can see how that would be confusing. They do set the ages running at the same pace
15/03/2019, 21:26 - David;: So the cunts on the crane are off your back?
15/03/2019, 21:27 - David;: Rooney really grinds to a screeching halt
15/03/2019, 21:27 - David;: On for a better than Messi career at 22
15/03/2019, 21:30 - Phill: Crane cunts gone.
15/03/2019, 21:30 - Phill: Turns out everyone senior in the construction industry does kilos of coke anyway
15/03/2019, 21:31 - Phill: Been at the races in a corporate box all week and they're all just coked up constantly
15/03/2019, 21:31 - Phill: Half the senior managers got sniffed out by dogs on the way in
15/03/2019, 21:32 - David;: Have you got to the bit on partridge where he's practicing spanking technique on a child doll?
15/03/2019, 21:32 - Phill: Yeah just watched it.
15/03/2019, 21:32 - Phill: In tears.
15/03/2019, 21:33 - David;: Lol how did that pan out?
15/03/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Very Barry Bennel
15/03/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Just discarded by security like glasto
15/03/2019, 21:34 - David;: 'not an abbreviation. No it's not an acronym either. It's an initialism'
15/03/2019, 21:34 - Phill: Like QI
15/03/2019, 21:34 - Phill: Would bang Jenny.

16/03/2019, 09:52 - Rob;: it was posted by one of The Sun's reporters, I'm not sure it is
16/03/2019, 09:54 - Rob;: There's a phone shadow and it's today's Sun, so it's been done very well and quickly if so
16/03/2019, 09:56 - Hamish Sinclair: I don't think I've seen the episode where he does this, is it in the later ones?

16/03/2019, 18:41 - Sam;: Lel, watching in the pub next to city fans,  waiting for the United game. A lovely little starter
16/03/2019, 18:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Are theybplaying a proper team?
16/03/2019, 18:42 - David;: Yeah, strong
16/03/2019, 18:43 - Sam;: And have now subbed on Stirling and aguero.
16/03/2019, 18:44 - Sam;: Fucking England. Has there every been a comeback from 31 nil down?
16/03/2019, 18:49 - David;: Are you broken?
16/03/2019, 18:51 - David;: Fuck just watched 1st goal. Swansea are Barcelona
16/03/2019, 18:51 - Sam;: Rugby Dave.

16/03/2019, 18:58 - Damian Rumble: Rugby dave
16/03/2019, 18:58 - Damian Rumble: One of the most mental matches I've seen in a while
16/03/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: That march is the best thing ever
16/03/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: Of course it would turn into a grim visual metaphor for Brexit
16/03/2019, 19:00 - Rob;: 350 people trudging through a gale
16/03/2019, 19:03 - David;: Not interested
16/03/2019, 19:03 - David;: Too much buzz now
16/03/2019, 19:05 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2019, 19:09 - Rob;: It's going to turn into a humanitarian crisis
16/03/2019, 19:13 - Sam;: Swansea were absolutely robbed
16/03/2019, 19:22 - David;: Joke that var used for some games not others
16/03/2019, 19:33 - Sam;: Yeah can’t believe that. It’s the quarters. Surely that’s big enough
16/03/2019, 19:34 - Damian Rumble: This looks like the world's shitest illegal rave
16/03/2019, 21:09 - David;: Romero >De Gea
16/03/2019, 21:30 - David;: That fucking goal
16/03/2019, 21:41 - Sam;: We’ve been beat fair and square tonight. Same as PEADOPOOL.
16/03/2019, 21:42 - David;: Yeah wolves are doing football in the cup
16/03/2019, 21:43 - David;: Looks to be a bit of a PSG hangover
16/03/2019, 21:44 - Sam;: Bit of hubris knocking about
16/03/2019, 21:44 - Jack G;: Tony Hubris
16/03/2019, 21:45 - David;: 👍
16/03/2019, 21:45 - David;: Is there any circumstance under which OGS doesn't get the job from here?
16/03/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: I don’t like to admit because I like the  fa cup but it doesn’t mean anything these days. It Only about the prem and CL.
16/03/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Loose top 4 from here and he won’t get the job
16/03/2019, 21:47 - Sam;: It would just look like a new manager bounce
16/03/2019, 21:49 - David;: Wow that's quite a high bar still
16/03/2019, 21:49 - David;: Far from certain
16/03/2019, 21:49 - David;: But dat positivity. Dat class of 92 nostalgic bullshit
16/03/2019, 21:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Agree that domestic cups are meaningless, and top 4 essential, but dont subscribe to this demand for trophys as the only measure of success
16/03/2019, 21:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Pochetino = big success
16/03/2019, 21:53 - Jack G;: Bet you’d be honking if you won the FA cup
16/03/2019, 21:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah it'd be good for the ride
16/03/2019, 21:55 - Hamish Sinclair: But meaningless
16/03/2019, 21:55 - David;: Don't agree fa cup meaningless, it's not binary in that way. Yes it means less than league or Europe. But more than league cup and about on par with 4th
16/03/2019, 21:56 - Jack G;: I think FA Cup is a great one for teams on a trophy drought too, gets that winning buzz back
16/03/2019, 21:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Would live Brighton to win the fa cup
16/03/2019, 21:57 - David;: E.g. that season Everton finished 4th and got dumped out in qualifiers. They would rather have had silverware to cap that era
16/03/2019, 21:57 - Sam;: The biggest thing tonight is Var
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, but I'm struggling to find another example where that's the case
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Sam;: No var at Swansea but var at wolves
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Jack G;: Remember when Wigan won the FA cup and for relegated in the same season. Where are they now?
16/03/2019, 21:58 - Sam;: Wot???
16/03/2019, 21:59 - Hamish Sinclair: In the lower leagues, 're living their cup run
16/03/2019, 21:59 - David;: Yeah but they would take that over scrotting around for 1/2 more relegation battles while winning nothing
16/03/2019, 21:59 - David;: Look at the fury at Puel this season for not caring about the cup
16/03/2019, 21:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Fa cup has more meaning outside top 4
16/03/2019, 22:00 - Hamish Sinclair: So for Leicester, wolves Brighton  etc it's important
16/03/2019, 22:06 - Jack G;: How many good moments has he actually given the fans though? A couple of nice wins in the champions league I guess. But they’ve not even got to cup final and regularly embarrass themselves
16/03/2019, 22:07 - David;: Getting ahead of Arsenal in the league would have been big for Spurs fans
16/03/2019, 22:07 - David;: Decades of butt hurt alleviated
16/03/2019, 22:08 - Jack G;: Put that straight in the trophy cabinet
16/03/2019, 22:09 - Hamish Sinclair: I think this is my point, no trophys doesn't equal failure
16/03/2019, 22:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Jack -would you prefer west ham yo be spurs right now Or win a one off fa cup?
16/03/2019, 22:10 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd prefer to be spurs personally
16/03/2019, 22:11 - Jack G;: No idea tbh, never experienced any consistent quality football or a trophy
16/03/2019, 22:11 - Jack G;: FA cup would be great
16/03/2019, 22:11 - Hamish Sinclair: His is like that delayed gratification  experiment they did on children
16/03/2019, 22:12 - David;: False choice. You could win an FA cup in the context of improving generally and comibg 4th. Then the fa cup would be a great market of that era
16/03/2019, 22:12 - David;: *marker
16/03/2019, 22:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, but on it's own potentially meaningless
16/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Yeah maybe. It can crown and encapsulate a broader period of quality/sucess
16/03/2019, 22:13 - David;: Which would feel empty without any trophy
16/03/2019, 22:13 - Hamish Sinclair: But that period of success is defined by other perameters
16/03/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Not the cup itself
16/03/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: The cup run is enjoyable in its self, but serves nonreal purpose or measure of progress
16/03/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: The footballing equivalent of a wank
16/03/2019, 22:15 - Jack G;: Perhaps footballers are less bothered about whether they get trophies these days as well due to getting a shit tonne of money
16/03/2019, 22:15 - David;: But you are more likely to win the cup due to being good generally. So it's related to that same improvement
16/03/2019, 22:15 - David;: And shows you have that ability to perform in key moments which is also a mark of great teams
16/03/2019, 22:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Fa cup couldn't save Wenger
16/03/2019, 22:16 - David;: Consistency alone isn't all about what defines good teams, that's why you need cup comps
16/03/2019, 22:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Which I think is the most damning evidence against it
16/03/2019, 22:17 - David;: E.g. Ronaldo is partly so good because he does it in key moments and finals.
16/03/2019, 22:17 - Jack G;: 3 FA cups too
16/03/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: Winning the FA cup, going to games in the run is great as a fan. Incredibly enjoyable even though the league or champs league would be better. And 6 of  Wenger's 7 wins came while also coming 4th and two doubles, so it's never felt like a binary thing of you either get a domestic trophy or you get a good league finish, just part of enjoying being a fan
16/03/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: But then on the flip side I actually enjoyed the Arsenal team a lot during the trophy drought. We had really excellent young players we'd brought through ourselves and played better football than we did in those last Wenger seasons with the 3 cups

17/03/2019, 18:05 - Rob;: And maybe win the Europa League
17/03/2019, 18:25 - Jack G;: Sarri bit that isn’t happening

18/03/2019, 10:38 - David;: Ha, such early 2000s clip art as well
18/03/2019, 10:39 - David;: But if they get you ticking nice little pictures you're not noticing the above-inflation price rises
18/03/2019, 10:40 - David;: Re-watched the matrix at the weekend. Spotted a massive plot hole. So the sun has been blocked out, and the machines start using the heat from people as a power source instead. How are the people being fed to provide the power with no sunlight? You can't replace a primary energy source with a secondary.
18/03/2019, 10:41 - David;: It's all bullshit, don't believe it really happened
18/03/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: Don’t they just get a mush
18/03/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: Patented mush
18/03/2019, 10:44 - Stefan;: Maybe everyone's eating the cyanobacteria that grow around volcanic vents on the seabed
18/03/2019, 10:44 - Stefan;: You could rustle a few good meals up from that
18/03/2019, 10:44 - David;: Probably similar in tase and nutritional content to Sam's mush.
18/03/2019, 10:45 - David;: But also it would never be more efficient to do that that use the bacteria directly as biomass energy. You are adding a stage up in the food chain.
18/03/2019, 10:46 - Phill: Synthetic light greenhouses.
18/03/2019, 10:47 - Phill: I've grown weed in the loft under LED's. No sun. Check.
18/03/2019, 10:48 - David;: But using lots of electricity in the process?
18/03/2019, 10:49 - David;: So rather than just using that electricity to power yourself, you use it to grow food that you then feed to humans that then generate heat that you turn into electricity to power yourself.
18/03/2019, 10:51 - Sam;: They liquidised the dead and feed them to the living. There’s a scene where they explain it
18/03/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: This is the explanation in the film, but you'd have diminishing returns
18/03/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Not enough people would die to feed the living, unless my never moving they expend so little energy as to make it efficient
18/03/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: The machines could have harnessed wind, wave and geothermal power efficiently to produce light to feed the plants to feed the humans to feed the machines
18/03/2019, 11:05 - Stefan;: *to feed the dead humans to feed the living humans to feed the machines
18/03/2019, 11:05 - Stefan;: Can't miss that step
18/03/2019, 11:06 - Rob;: Any the humans originally made the machines to feed to humans to make more machines
18/03/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: So the machines are eating and digesting now?
18/03/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: Or they just live off the body heat
18/03/2019, 11:12 - Paul;: What’s going on
18/03/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: Dave's completely right, it would always be more efficient to run a machine from a primary source than a secondary. The machines are losing out by enslaving humanity. Just in it for the trolling
18/03/2019, 11:17 - Jack G;: Machines with trolling and banter, picking up on humanities greatest traits
18/03/2019, 11:20 - David;: Wind is ultimately produced by the sun unevenly heating the world - wave and geothermal yes but still the efficiency problem.
18/03/2019, 11:20 - David;: Yeah exactly - trolling is the only legitimate explanation
18/03/2019, 11:22 - David;: Also if they're that fucking good can't they just unblock the skies?
18/03/2019, 11:23 - Paul;: Can they not work around the clouds? Build structures that penetrate the cloud layer?
18/03/2019, 11:24 - David;: Just build up a bit. High rise. Doesn't seem that complicated.
18/03/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: Yeah, they have no need for oxygen and can withstand cold, just go up
18/03/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: Or down, enjoy the mantle, it's yours
18/03/2019, 11:25 - David;: Nice mini break in the mantle
18/03/2019, 11:26 - David;: 5* on trip advisor for a winter getaway.
18/03/2019, 11:27 - Rob;: Why do machines need so much space anyway their their consciousnesses aren't bound to bodies. Like in Her - billions of 'beings' could occupy a very small space, maybe a single very efficient computer
18/03/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: They could all just have a nice chat
18/03/2019, 11:28 - David;: They're not those kind of machines Rob
18/03/2019, 11:29 - David;: Not the chatty type
18/03/2019, 11:29 - Rob;: They should just live in the Matrix, cut the humans out of it
18/03/2019, 11:29 - Rob;: Simulate your own great planet
18/03/2019, 11:30 - David;: Yeah 'we've built this amazing fantasy dreamworld but we're only going to use it for the race we've enslaved. We'll stay in the polluted dark shit hole of a world we conquered'
18/03/2019, 11:31 - David;: Maybe they have a better matrix they live in most of the time and they just do the human haresting etc. as the day job to keep the power flowing in
18/03/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: 'but it's the humans in their blissful ignorance who are the real losers here'
18/03/2019, 11:32 - Paul;: Breaking down the matrix is shitter than being in it
18/03/2019, 11:32 - Paul;: You’d be pissed off to be woken from the matrix
18/03/2019, 11:33 - David;: Think I would be the guy who was like fuck this I just want to go back into the Matrix rather than fight a terrifying war against unassailable robot overlords. I was doing just fine as an accountant back in the Matrix. Had just bought a new flatscreen. Had a holiday booked in the Canaries.
18/03/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: Yeah, and permanently living in a pre-climate change world. No need to worry about the future, teh machines will just turn it off and on again
18/03/2019, 11:58 - Paul;: So the whole plot of the matrix is just fucked now? So we can deduce we’re not living in a simulation?
18/03/2019, 11:59 - David;: It's unlikely to be the case

18/03/2019, 14:01 - David;: 'select the suppliers' - only £49 to take on some extra procurement work
18/03/2019, 14:02 - David;: 'set admission prices'.

18/03/2019, 16:30 - Phill: Did I fuck. Don't even have the attention span to play footy manager beyond a transfer window
18/03/2019, 16:30 - Damian Rumble: Ummm.... I payed £49. I want to buy Messi, mbappe, Ronaldo. I want they all to do 300 press ups everyday and I want season tickets to cost £2.50
18/03/2019, 16:44 - David;: Bercow's gone rogue

Look, we've found out about this Matrix business, and we are pretty miffed, but how about you release a patch to end war, suffering and injustice, and give us all free speedboats and we'll call it even?'
18/03/2019, 17:14 - David;: They did explain that by saying they made a great version of it first and everyone was miserable
18/03/2019, 17:15 - David;: So the machines made it shittier for us because we hadn't made the most of it
18/03/2019, 17:15 - David;: So human nature fucked it up
18/03/2019, 17:16 - David;: But not too shitty that we would rebel. So we live in a world just shitty enough to seem real and where there are problems to solve but not so shitty that we rise up against it.
18/03/2019, 17:19 - Rob;: Ah fair enough, I accept eternal enslavement then, thank you for agreeing to meet with me Mr Machines

21/03/2019, 14:04 - David;: North Wales not having anything to do with it

21/03/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: Ah ok
21/03/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: So as a proportion North Wales isn't that low

21/03/2019, 14:10 - David;: Yeah, the bit around ByC is just average, similar % to rest of the north

22/03/2019, 12:36 - David;: 3m on the old petich now
22/03/2019, 12:36 - Jack G;: Can no say no to devote
22/03/2019, 12:36 - Jack G;: Debote*
22/03/2019, 12:37 - David;: Will there no be debote
22/03/2019, 12:37 - Jack G;: Maybot ist debotten
22/03/2019, 12:42 - Paul;: Only half people signing it are actually in the uk
22/03/2019, 12:42 - Paul;: It’s all fake news
22/03/2019, 12:43 - Jack G;: Where are you getting those stats from? Also could be: EU nationals, people away on work, people using VPN. They have loads of checks on the petitions to eliminate fraudulent signatures
22/03/2019, 12:43 - Paul;: It’s just a fact
22/03/2019, 12:43 - Jack G;: You’re spreading the real fake news
22/03/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: But they already know about 15m people don't want to leave. There was a referendum
22/03/2019, 12:46 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
22/03/2019, 12:46 - Jack G;: What percentage of people usual sign petitions though? It’s all proportional. There’s a no deal one I found that’s been live for 6 months: 450,000 signatures
22/03/2019, 12:47 - Jack G;: You have to register your name, address and email and that is checked against uk nationals. But sure “anyone can sign it”
22/03/2019, 12:50 - Paul;: 1.5million bots signed it
22/03/2019, 12:52 - Jack G;: Even if true wouldn’t care. It was Russian bots spreading anti EU propaganda that led us into this shit storm anyway
22/03/2019, 12:55 - Paul;: Should let the bots sort it out. Damian’s perfect political system
22/03/2019, 12:55 - Paul;: You can’t trust people
22/03/2019, 12:55 - Jack G;: Kernel Microsoft
22/03/2019, 14:20 - / James Ball: It would be relatively complicated (but not impossible) to set up a bot system for this due to email verification. Also when the petitions are on this large a scale they tend to start to have monitored external verification. Ie 1000s of signatures from .ru email addresses will be ruled out
22/03/2019, 14:20 - / James Ball: I just tried to sign it from Russia via a VPN though and it would have let me do so
22/03/2019, 16:38 - Paul;: See jack, Russian bots
22/03/2019, 16:39 - Jack G;: I thought you were against the matrix, why are you so pro bot?

22/03/2019, 16:49 - Sam;: Czech
22/03/2019, 16:49 - Sam;: Pilsner republic
22/03/2019, 16:52 - Jack G;: They’re no Kazakhstan
22/03/2019, 16:53 - Hamish Sinclair: I still exaggerate how good they are based on euro 96
22/03/2019, 16:53 - / James Ball: Czechia now surely
22/03/2019, 16:53 - Rob;: I like how no one cares about that
22/03/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: Like Eswartini
22/03/2019, 17:00 - Jack G;: Jan Koller - the original Peter Crouch
22/03/2019, 17:42 - David;: Yeah good luck with that.
22/03/2019, 17:51 - Damian Rumble: An alternative fact...
22/03/2019, 17:53 - Sam;: Good cyber security and the government do not fit together at all
22/03/2019, 17:53 - Sam;: CDs left on trains..
22/03/2019, 17:54 - Jack G;: Yet they’re hell bent on blocking porn...
22/03/2019, 17:55 - Sam;: Well they say it. But they have no idea how that translates into technology. Or the legal ramifications
22/03/2019, 17:55 - Jack G;: Go back to the good old days of fhm and playboy magazine
22/03/2019, 17:56 - Sam;: Finding porn in the woods.

24/03/2019, 11:07 - David;: How has this escaped your notice?
24/03/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: I definitely remember a conversation about bread where you dismissed sour dough as hipster nonsense and said it was too 'modern'
24/03/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: And we all trolled you for it
24/03/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: And now you've come crawling back

24/03/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: I wonder if there's a thread somewhere where one of your colleagues discusses your diet at length with their friends, like us and Phil's cocktail sausage man
24/03/2019, 11:16 - Damian Rumble: Well I literally just finished Cumberland sausages, bacon with beans on sourdough toast so probably just extrapolate from that
24/03/2019, 11:22 - Paul;: What made you try sourdough though? You are normally far too stuck in your ways to do something as wild and adventurous as that
24/03/2019, 11:29 - David;: I remember the phase of exclusively eating cheesy chips and doughnuts at the chippy school canteen
24/03/2019, 11:31 - Stefan;: I remember in year 7 being told by someone "you hold your fork well posh" when I was eating chips in the canteen

28/03/2019, 15:56 - Sam;: Had to hang up from laughing
28/03/2019, 15:56 - Sam;: He called back and I just said the line dropped
28/03/2019, 15:57 - Sam;: Wendan Wang
28/03/2019, 16:04 - Paul;: Hugo McGlue
28/03/2019, 16:47 - Stefan;: Hello, yes this is Hugh Jass

28/03/2019, 17:38 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
28/03/2019, 18:41 - Paul;: Old spooners CEO massively is pro brexit
28/03/2019, 18:41 - Paul;: *is massively
28/03/2019, 18:43 - Jack G;: Yeah didn’t he stop selling jagermeister and other spirits from EU countries?
28/03/2019, 18:43 - Jack G;: European lager fine though. Nice logic
28/03/2019, 18:43 - Paul;: Think he has swapped out euro lager as well
28/03/2019, 18:44 - Jack G;: But Stella surely a staple
28/03/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: Nope
28/03/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: Ales
28/03/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: No piss. Ales
28/03/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: Fine British ales
28/03/2019, 18:44 - Jack G;: Classy establishment
28/03/2019, 18:45 - Sam;: Stella more expensive
28/03/2019, 18:45 - Sam;: It’s all about shipyard or hop house
28/03/2019, 19:16 - Phill: >shityard
28/03/2019, 19:18 - Paul;: What’s the taste like?
28/03/2019, 19:19 - Sam;: For me it’s a great hybrid between lager and ale. Flavour of ale, crispness of lager, but still very smooth
28/03/2019, 19:19 - Sam;: Only 2.55 a pint as well
28/03/2019, 20:43 - Phill: You know what really grinds my gears?
28/03/2019, 20:44 - Paul;: A rusty chain
28/03/2019, 20:44 - Phill: The use of yeast as a fucking ingredient in food
28/03/2019, 20:44 - Phill: >roast yeast
28/03/2019, 20:44 - Phill: >yeast ice cream
28/03/2019, 20:44 - Phill: >any type of yeast crumb
28/03/2019, 20:44 - Paul;: Who’s making yeast ice cream?
28/03/2019, 20:45 - Phill: Some cunt on TV
28/03/2019, 21:09 - David;: >hop house
28/03/2019, 21:11 - Paul;: >yeast house
28/03/2019, 21:13 - Rob;: Hop house would be European - Irish
28/03/2019, 21:14 - Rob;: Do you like Marmite?
28/03/2019, 21:45 - Phill: Yeah marmite fine.
28/03/2019, 21:45 - Phill: Don't make a soil or a parfait out of it.
28/03/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Yeah that's fair
28/03/2019, 21:46 - Rob;: You hear a lot about people adding it to things to add an umami flavour, as a vegan alternative to worcestershire sauce or stock
28/03/2019, 21:46 - Phill: You don't deserve umami if you're a vegan imho.
28/03/2019, 21:46 - David;: Agreed
28/03/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: Soy sauce
28/03/2019, 21:47 - David;: That's all you get.
28/03/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: And Marmite
28/03/2019, 21:48 - Phill: Yeast is living though
28/03/2019, 21:48 - Phill: Do they know?
28/03/2019, 21:48 - Rob;: Yeah they don't seem to care about microorganisms
28/03/2019, 21:49 - Rob;: I mean it would be impractical to care, you kill some every time you wash your hands
28/03/2019, 21:49 - Phill: Go big or go home.
28/03/2019, 21:50 - / James Ball: Marmots ice cream is a thing
28/03/2019, 21:50 - / James Ball: Marmite
28/03/2019, 21:50 - / James Ball: Although some marmot ice cream might also be nice
28/03/2019, 21:52 - Paul;: Yellow bellied marmot ice cream
28/03/2019, 21:54 - / James Ball: Fucking de-lish
28/03/2019, 22:25 - Phill: Why does Andy Cole look half dead these days?
28/03/2019, 22:26 - Phill: Ah thatll be the kidney failure
28/03/2019, 23:50 - Damian Rumble: Lol not a thing
29/03/2019, 10:03 - Damian Rumble: I imagine that when john Bercow is having sex with his wife, as he approaches climax, he starts bellowing "order! Orrrrddeeeeer!" At her.
29/03/2019, 10:09 - Rob;: You imagine that, do you?

29/03/2019, 11:35 - Jack G;: TIG now an official party Change UK. Acronym of CUK, unfortunate...
29/03/2019, 12:14 - Damian Rumble: These are going to get butt raped by fptp so badly.
29/03/2019, 14:25 - Damian Rumble: Major arse clenching going on ahead of this third vote...
29/03/2019, 14:29 - Jack G;: Pretty confident it’s going to lose again by about 50
29/03/2019, 14:35 - Damian Rumble: Would be ideal if it got less than mps who voted for the people's vote, but I reckon it will be more
29/03/2019, 14:35 - Hamish Sinclair: How many voted for peoples vote?
29/03/2019, 14:36 - Jack G;: Would be good yeah but surely the deal is killed off by any loss. Can’t have a 4th vote on it
29/03/2019, 14:37 - Damian Rumble: I think it was 268
29/03/2019, 14:37 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm a bit confused. If they vote for it, do we leave ontime?
29/03/2019, 14:38 - Damian Rumble: If they vote for it we leave on the 22nd may
29/03/2019, 14:38 - Hamish Sinclair: And If we don't?
29/03/2019, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: Pass
29/03/2019, 14:39 - Jack G;: Probably a long extension and general election unless the indicative votes go well on Monday
29/03/2019, 14:43 - Jack G;: Loss by 58
29/03/2019, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: Good call @447746875764
29/03/2019, 14:48 - Rob;: Extension to mid April if we don't pass it
29/03/2019, 14:48 - Rob;: They gave us two dates, depending on which way it went
29/03/2019, 14:49 - Rob;: 12 April for the unconditional extension
29/03/2019, 14:50 - Damian Rumble: Well I guess Teresa gets to keep her job for the time being...
29/03/2019, 14:53 - Jack G;: 4th time lucky?
29/03/2019, 16:05 - Damian Rumble: Not with that margin and in only a handful of days
29/03/2019, 16:06 - Damian Rumble: Interesting that May said that "we are reaching the limits of this process in the house". Is she hinting at a referendum...?
29/03/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: Referendum would definitely just be another leave vote. All controls are set to troll. We'll never escape it
29/03/2019, 16:07 - Damian Rumble: Surely her only options are to hold a public vote on her deal or resign, hold a general election and get who ever wins that to start again?
29/03/2019, 16:15 - Jack G;: I’m hoping that common market 2.0 wins a majority in the indicative votes, it’s attached into the political declaration and we vote that through. Would need a medium term extension to get EU to amend the agreements though
29/03/2019, 16:26 - Stefan;: I think remain would win against any specific form of Brexit deal, rather the abstract idea of Brexit
29/03/2019, 16:27 - Stefan;: All the polls show it (and a pretty consistent albeit smaller lead for remain v. leave generally in the last year)
29/03/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: But you're forgetting the rule that everything you love will die and everything you hate will triumph
29/03/2019, 16:28 - Jack G;: But they’ll be a campaign, could easily convert a load of people back with the “betrayal of the people” mantra
29/03/2019, 16:29 - Stefan;: Ah yes, that does tend to get in the way of things
29/03/2019, 16:42 - Jack G;: Must be a butt blow to Leadsom that the government was embarrassed so close to Mother’s Day
29/03/2019, 17:54 - David;: So we're heading for a little Gennie?
29/03/2019, 18:06 - Stefan;: I'm still game for another little Reffo
29/03/2019, 18:26 - Phill: No reffo. Deffo a genno tho.

29/03/2019, 18:50 - Phill: Ben Lomond?

29/03/2019, 22:40 - Phill: >with some people bitching about Brexit
29/03/2019, 22:40 - Phill: >their main argument is that people didn't actually know why they wanted to leave

30/03/2019, 14:14 - Paul;: What’s the role?
30/03/2019, 14:43 - Phill: Chief Liberal Propaganda Artist
30/03/2019, 14:45 - Phill: Had a dream last night which vaguely had something about >tough mudder
30/03/2019, 14:45 - Phill: Checked my phone this morning. Tough mudder ad on my phone

31/03/2019, 11:15 - David;: I like the mocked up picture of a dogger as if it is purely for informational purposes
31/03/2019, 11:15 - David;: Without it you could never grasp what the story was about
31/03/2019, 11:17 - Rob;: 'spilled his muck'

31/03/2019, 17:18 - Phill: Dave do you now know what green is?

31/03/2019, 17:24 - Phill: <Media omitted>
31/03/2019, 17:24 - Paul;: So what is kosher salt if not for the Jew?
31/03/2019, 17:25 - Phill: Salt sans iodine
31/03/2019, 17:27 - Phill: The term Kosher salt gained common usage in North America and refers to its use in the Jewish religious practice of dry brining meats—known as koshering or kashering—as opposed to the salt itself being manufactured under religious guidelines.
31/03/2019, 18:13 - Jack G;: Missoko
31/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: Yeah it's already come to my attention
31/03/2019, 18:29 - David;: <Media omitted>
01/04/2019, 13:00 - David;: Lol, Morelos. 5 red cards this season.
01/04/2019, 13:02 - David;: The suspensions on that.
01/04/2019, 13:29 - Rob;: Hard to see how he's had the chance to get sent off so much, considering how suspensions will have limited his playing time
01/04/2019, 13:37 - David;: Theoretical maximum straight red cards would be 10 - 3 games suspended each time and then the game you get sent off in each time would be 37 games.
01/04/2019, 13:37 - David;: So he's at half that
01/04/2019, 13:37 - David;: Although looks like one was in Europe
01/04/2019, 13:42 - David;: Presumably you'd need to be scoring a hat-trick and winning the match in each of the games you got sent off in to justify re-election every time. Would be quite a season
01/04/2019, 13:49 - Rob;: He may also have received additional suspensions for getting 5 yellows in either or both halves of the season
01/04/2019, 13:51 - David;: I'm imagining just 10 hat-trick match-winning performances but with a violent conduct straight red in each.
01/04/2019, 13:52 - David;: No yellows. One huge lash-out at 80 minutes every time he plays.
01/04/2019, 13:52 - David;: But undroppable

02/04/2019, 13:27 - Jack G;: And guess what the first things the EU will ask us for in the trade negotiations will be. £39 billion and the Irish backstop. It’s utterly pointless self harm

02/04/2019, 19:25 - David;: EU might just pie it off

03/04/2019, 11:20 - Damian Rumble: Watched Laura kuenssberg's Brexit documentary last night. Would recommend
03/04/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: Yeah the clandestine little meetings she has with people are interesting
03/04/2019, 11:26 - Rob;: They all clearly try to use her as much as she uses them
03/04/2019, 11:34 - Damian Rumble: I enjoyed the way all the politicians are straight on the phone to her leaking after every meeting.... It's like watching 'the thick of it' all over again
03/04/2019, 11:42 - David;: Was a good watch but didnt think it gave much additional insight - not exactly a secret that party discipline has completely disintegrated.
03/04/2019, 11:44 - David;: Main take away was that Steve Baker is a weird little bloke and will never vote for the deal.
03/04/2019, 11:44 - Rob;: Was he the won who kept affecting tears and a lump in his throat?
03/04/2019, 11:45 - David;: Yeah, and has a bit of a Joe Hill vibe
03/04/2019, 11:47 - David;: *Joe Taylor.
03/04/2019, 11:47 - David;: Key difference
03/04/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Yeah big Taylor vibe
03/04/2019, 11:50 - David;: Has a very inflated sense of his importance - definitely imagines himself as a Churchillian figure.
03/04/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: Steven John Baker
03/04/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: RAF engineer. Classic self importance raising job

03/04/2019, 12:39 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I thought it was bizzare timing really. Surely it would have made more sense to bring out the documentary after Brexit was sorted. Feels like they rushed the more recent bits (though that is probably symptomatic of the overall sense of chaos at the moment)
03/04/2019, 12:40 - Jack G;: Feels like it will never be sorted though. We’ll just be stuck in a never ending brexit purgatory

03/04/2019, 13:41 - David;: Rob you need to do a piece of investigative food journalism exposing sour dough fraud. It's everywhere.
03/04/2019, 13:42 - David;: People seem to be using the term sourdough to mean 'quite nice bread' as if no one will notice
03/04/2019, 13:42 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
03/04/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: I find out about quite a lot of misleading food stuff
03/04/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: Tesco are obviously awful
03/04/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: I have been toying with contacting private eye
03/04/2019, 13:45 - Rob;: Like most supermarkets, their sour dough is just bread with yogurt in it to make it taste like it
03/04/2019, 13:45 - David;: Sour dough especially susceptible though, because people have heard about the buzz but have no idea what it really means
03/04/2019, 13:45 - Rob;: Tesco currently being very dodgy about how they advertise their use of sustainable cocoa
03/04/2019, 13:46 - David;: And it's actually pretty difficult to make at scale so big incentive for fraud
03/04/2019, 13:47 - David;: I'd be willing to guess more than 50% of bread sold as sourdough is not sourdough
03/04/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: Lots of that kind of thing about
03/04/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: More British honey is sold than produced
03/04/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: Same with sustainable-certified palm oil
03/04/2019, 13:49 - David;: Why do they not get called out by the standards agencies?
03/04/2019, 13:51 - Rob;: Fraud tends to happen further up the supply chain than the checks, before any regulation can happen
03/04/2019, 13:52 - Rob;: Primark got done for unknowingly buying real fur disguised as fake sfuff
03/04/2019, 13:52 - Paul;: It’s like when we were eating horse meat

03/04/2019, 14:19 - Rob;: Tony's kept bees of course being the perfect model to extrapolate worldwide bee population health from. Stop all the other science now.
03/04/2019, 14:22 - David;: Bees in Oxfordshire currently loving it
03/04/2019, 14:23 - David;: He's a point there - shit parking to be fair

05/04/2019, 18:53 - Sam;: City to win the league because Liverpool fans are the worst. Insufferable. City fans don’t know how to celebrate, not used to being good but Liverpool fans will go on about this for a generation.
05/04/2019, 18:53 - Hamish Sinclair: But what about the future of football Sam?
05/04/2019, 18:53 - Phill: So bitter.

In less than six seconds flat.
He's always on the scene.
Plasti  Sam!
And his shirt is bright and clean.
Plastic Sam!
You can not ignore,
Sam is the bitter next door.
Honking down the busy streets,
Greeting city fans that he meets.
City could be in a jam,
So, hurry hurry Plastic Sam
05/04/2019, 18:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Depends who replaces him
05/04/2019, 18:58 - Hamish Sinclair: They can essentially pick whichever manager they want

05/04/2019, 18:59 - Jack G;: How many managers at the level of Pep are around though? Barely any. They’ll have a big slump at the end of his tender. Got to grab that opportunity
05/04/2019, 18:59 - Jack G;: Tenure*
05/04/2019, 19:01 - Sam;: I had to pick one and fuck PEADOPOOL. City aren’t a real club so it doesn’t matter.

07/04/2019, 19:46 - David;: But also really taking the edge off
07/04/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: Solo two bottles?
07/04/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: Big sleep risk there
07/04/2019, 19:50 - David;: Might have to see off some tomorrow.
07/04/2019, 19:53 - David;: Got cheese and crackers as well. Very close.
07/04/2019, 21:13 - Phill: Just what you want to find the day of a hangover.
07/04/2019, 21:13 - Phill: Two open bottles of red.
07/04/2019, 21:14 - Damian Rumble: I see your two bottles of red and raise you the two gallons of cider that I drank yesterday (or at least that is what it feels like)
07/04/2019, 21:14 - Phill: Can you read?
07/04/2019, 21:19 - / James Ball: I call bullshit. You can't have consumed more than your own volume
07/04/2019, 21:21 - Damian Rumble: Having just googled that the human body contains only one gallon of blood that seems a  reasonable assessment haha!
07/04/2019, 21:22 - Phill: How much is a gallon?
07/04/2019, 21:22 - Phill: Ah 4.5 litres
07/04/2019, 21:23 - Phill: Seems a reasonable amount of booze
07/04/2019, 21:23 - Phill: 8 pints
07/04/2019, 21:24 - / James Ball: I just meant that Damo's total volume is less than 2 gallons
07/04/2019, 21:25 - David;: So he drank half his own blood volume?
07/04/2019, 21:25 - / James Ball: Double
07/04/2019, 21:27 - David;: I guess you are constantly pissing
07/04/2019, 21:27 - / James Ball: Damo not thicc enough to have more volume
07/04/2019, 21:27 - David;: He was more cider than man by the end
07/04/2019, 21:29 - / James Ball: It's possible he was maybe going pelican and storing it all in a neck pouch to digest as required
07/04/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: We've all drunk way more than 2 gallons in an evening
07/04/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: Or in a day at least
07/04/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: 16 pints. It's been known to happen
07/04/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: Sam on the Stella cans
07/04/2019, 21:33 - / James Ball: Not saying it's impossible for a regular human
07/04/2019, 21:34 - Rob;: Right, just a 2D one
07/04/2019, 21:36 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure how I feel about the prospect that a 'normal' human can regularly drink more their own volume of blood in booze in a single sitting...
07/04/2019, 21:36 - Damian Rumble: https://www.itv.com/news/2019-04-07/brexit-latest-theresa-may-extension-eu-emergency-summit-donald-tusk/?fbclid=IwAR37VYUNZngvLVO0DXY0kyGBrV2OWKDiLDij_McNgQ1JLiJmkVJhxMWAnDg
07/04/2019, 21:37 - / James Ball: Fun fact an actual 2D human would actually consist of two separate pieces separated from mouth to anus
07/04/2019, 23:12 - David;: Not getting close to that
08/04/2019, 09:41 - Phill: (wholemeal mushroom pasta + ale + garlic bread)*coffee^2=SLURRY
08/04/2019, 09:44 - David;: I get into work this morning and my arse just collapses
08/04/2019, 09:53 - David;: Fuck just watching FA cup highlights. Deloufeu
08/04/2019, 10:36 - Phill: Yeah DAT first goal
08/04/2019, 12:41 - Paul;: I need more details around this
08/04/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: Feel like this would be a huge Wales conversation
08/04/2019, 12:47 - / James Ball: Essentially your mouth and anus are directly linked via pipe. If you were 2D rather than 3D a pipe would be drawn as just two unconnected parallel lines thus dividing you in half.
08/04/2019, 12:48 - David;: 'fun fact'
08/04/2019, 12:49 - / James Ball: One for parties and funerals
08/04/2019, 12:49 - Paul;: So you get to see the digestion and shit generation in action
08/04/2019, 12:49 - Stefan;: Presumably then you'd only have blood and air supply on one side of your body
08/04/2019, 12:49 - David;: But hold on your anus is connected to itself
08/04/2019, 12:50 - / James Ball: Nahh, two lungs mate
08/04/2019, 12:50 - David;: At all points
08/04/2019, 12:50 - Paul;: Cut down middle one lung only
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: I suppose this is only a problem if you're 2D in a 3D world
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Stefan;: You've only got one mouth and one heart - they've got to be on one side, but the airways and blood vessels can't cross to the other side
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Stefan;: Because of the mouth-anus divide
08/04/2019, 12:51 - Paul;: Shit pipe blocks all
08/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Essentially you'd be a walking CT scan
08/04/2019, 12:52 - / James Ball: And Israel and Palestine think they've got it rough
08/04/2019, 12:52 - David;: I was thinking more like if you unwrapped a human and flattened it to 2d form. This seems more like taking a 2d cross-section
08/04/2019, 12:53 - / James Ball: 2d cross section is how you'd appear in the second dimension
08/04/2019, 12:53 - Stefan;: Lol
08/04/2019, 12:53 - Stefan;: Unwrapping a human
08/04/2019, 12:54 - / James Ball: Ie we perceive the 4th dimension (time) as continually changing snapshots or "slices" if you will
08/04/2019, 12:54 - David;: Hold on - fly in the ointment. The top of the head above the mouth is still connected to both sides
08/04/2019, 12:55 - / James Ball: Ah yes that is true but still fundamentally divided in haf
08/04/2019, 12:55 - David;: So everything would have to flow through the brain
08/04/2019, 12:56 - / James Ball: I guess a 2d being would perceive us as tentacle monsters
08/04/2019, 12:56 - David;: Huge bottleneck in the brain with having to process all bloodflow from side to side
08/04/2019, 12:56 - / James Ball: With a large central brain at the top
08/04/2019, 12:57 - Rob;: Have you read Flatland, James?
08/04/2019, 12:57 - David;: The downward pressure would quickly mean the two sides seperated so that you are supported on the floor by either sides of your intestines and at the center by the roof of your mouth.
08/04/2019, 12:58 - / James Ball: Have not - should I?
08/04/2019, 12:58 - Stefan;: I suppose the shit pipe could have valves or gateways to let the air and blood vessels cross over. I.e. shut the shit gates, open the blood gates, and vice versa
08/04/2019, 12:59 - / James Ball: I like that this has now become a design consultation - "the perfect 2D human"
08/04/2019, 12:59 - / James Ball: We need more shit valves
08/04/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: It's basically this conversation, but with geometric shapes that can't handle the concept of other dimensions
08/04/2019, 13:01 - David;: But couldnt open all the blood gates at once otherwise intantly split down the middle again. So have to open them one at a time to let shit through like canal locks
08/04/2019, 13:01 - Rob;: Slaughterhouse 5 also relevant
08/04/2019, 13:01 - David;: Quite tenuous - that's more to do with time being non-linear
08/04/2019, 13:02 - Rob;: But the bit where he talks to the aliens about how they experience time as a dimension they can move through is relevant
08/04/2019, 13:03 - David;: Do not recall the shit pipe problem being covered extensively
08/04/2019, 13:04 - / James Ball: Is only covered by the finest theologians
08/04/2019, 13:04 - / James Ball: The shit pipe paradox
08/04/2019, 13:08 - David;: So just revisiting the human centipede on wikipedia
08/04/2019, 13:08 - David;: 'When approaching investors prior to filming, Six did not mention the mouth-to-anus aspect of the plot, fearing it would put off potential backers. The financiers of The Human Centipede did not discover the full nature of the film until it was complete.'
08/04/2019, 13:08 - David;: Good to commission that without realising.
08/04/2019, 13:09 - Sam;: That’s great. Watching the final cut and not knowing what’s coming
08/04/2019, 13:10 - David;: Thought it was a rom-com
08/04/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Pitched as a remake of Kafta's Metamorphosis
08/04/2019, 13:21 - Stefan;: "We were led to believe it was a children's cartoon about a loveable anthropomorphic centipede"
08/04/2019, 13:21 - David;: Lol
08/04/2019, 13:21 - David;: But have to release it to recoup the money
08/04/2019, 13:26 - Rob;: Huge product placement
08/04/2019, 13:27 - Rob;: The cotton firm who paid to have their product used was furious
08/04/2019, 13:29 - Stefan;: So who financed the sequel? No room for doubt there
08/04/2019, 13:30 - David;: They were probably just living arse to mouth
08/04/2019, 13:56 - Paul;: Can we get some diagrams explaining the 2D shit pipe conundrum
08/04/2019, 14:02 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 14:11 - Damian Rumble: This throws my whole understanding of Mr Game and Watch in to disrepute...
08/04/2019, 14:11 - / James Ball: I'm glad this is being properly documented
08/04/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Turn the head 90 degrees and youd have your seperation
08/04/2019, 14:12 - / James Ball: Skull still connects both sides above the mouth though
08/04/2019, 14:14 - / James Ball: Shit pipe - divides body in half
Skull - exists
08/04/2019, 14:14 - David;: Ah yes but the skull in 2d is only a lining around the top of the head
08/04/2019, 14:15 - David;: Don't get the back or front
08/04/2019, 14:15 - / James Ball: Would still connect both sides from whatever angle surely
08/04/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: How do you do arms?
08/04/2019, 14:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Put head at 90 degrees
08/04/2019, 14:20 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 14:21 - Rob;: No penis here
08/04/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: Yeah this is how I pictured it
08/04/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: Dave in your version he can't eat, if he's living in a 2D world
08/04/2019, 14:22 - Stefan;: Can't get food across the edge of his face to the mouth hole
08/04/2019, 14:27 - / James Ball: Ah right yes, I was imagining it differently
08/04/2019, 14:27 - / James Ball: Extra points for the dong
08/04/2019, 14:35 - Paul;: Surely you wouldn’t separate
08/04/2019, 14:37 - Paul;: If you cut a pipe in half you still get left with wall of the pipe holding its structure
08/04/2019, 14:37 - Rob;: Can you eat 3D food if you're a 2D being?
08/04/2019, 14:37 - Paul;: Structure would still count?
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Paul;: Even if 2D
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Paul;: Or does it dissolve and you’re destined to float apart
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Rob;: Yeah, your enzymes rely on their 3D structure to work
08/04/2019, 14:38 - Rob;: Your haemoglobin wouldn't be able to carry oxygen in 2D
08/04/2019, 14:39 - / James Ball: It would still be carrying it in 3D you just wouldn't know that if you were a 2d being witnessing it
08/04/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 15:34 - Rob;: Very true
08/04/2019, 15:56 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 15:56 - David;: Solved the problem
08/04/2019, 15:57 - David;: Can get food in through the ear canals
08/04/2019, 15:57 - David;: So then he actually becomes 3 strips
08/04/2019, 15:57 - David;: Top of head is a small also detached surface
08/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: Just use one ear?
08/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: Still retain hearing
08/04/2019, 16:00 - David;: Could use 2, that's just an artists impression
08/04/2019, 16:01 - David;: For educational purposes
08/04/2019, 16:09 - Damian Rumble: How's that postdoc going Dave?
08/04/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: A friend at work plays D&D
08/04/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: She's just been telling me that last night they found out one of the people they play with, an old school friend, has spent months laying into them all on a D&D forum
08/04/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: Personal attacks as well as criticism of how they play it etc
08/04/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: And it's been hard not to laugh
08/04/2019, 17:23 - Rob;: But basically they've been making this guy dinner every week and having a laugh, and he's been like 'look at these absolute noobs'
08/04/2019, 17:23 - David;: She
08/04/2019, 17:23 - David;: That's a surprise in itself
08/04/2019, 17:23 - Rob;: Yeah, yeah. She bucks the trend. I was quite surprised to learn
08/04/2019, 17:24 - David;: Mate said he was going round to someone's house at the weekend to play a game that you can only play once because you break the game as you play it
08/04/2019, 17:25 - David;: Sounded very intense and meta
08/04/2019, 17:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Is that pandemic?
08/04/2019, 17:35 - David;: No, I've played that at veritys that's the co-op one
08/04/2019, 17:36 - David;: Youre all coordinating to fight the disease
08/04/2019, 18:01 - Sam;: Arsenals away from is baffling. Title winning home form this season and last. Mid table away from home
08/04/2019, 18:04 - Rob;: I can bring Pandemic to Wales
08/04/2019, 18:04 - Paul;: Can you also bring a pandemic
08/04/2019, 18:16 - Rob;: It's strange that it has continued across two mamagers
08/04/2019, 22:07 - Damian Rumble: @447752458076  - legal question for you. I recently was sent a letter detailing outstanding debt for PCN I 'received' in Cardiff in 15/06/2018. The first I knew about this was when this letter (dated 21/02/2019, delayed because it was sent to my old house) arrived, over 8 months after the offense. They are provided no evidence or explanation of the offense but I can track my movements on google maps and clearly demonstrate that whilst I drove along the road in question on that date, I did not park at any point and hence was not given any ticket at the time. I have sent them all this information. Do you think this is the kind of thing I could successfully appeal in court if need be?
08/04/2019, 22:10 - Jack G;: Could have been driving in a bus lane?
08/04/2019, 22:10 - David;: PCN's are a massive shit storm - outsourced to a private agency so you can never get hold of anyone to talk to about it. We had a thing where our car got stolen and racked up
08/04/2019, 22:11 - David;: PCNs where it was left. Took fucking ages to deal with. They are complete cunts.
08/04/2019, 22:11 - David;: Unaccountable.
08/04/2019, 22:29 - Stefan;: I have no idea tbh. Never worked on PCNs and I don't know what the process is
08/04/2019, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: 5 years of law school for nothing
08/04/2019, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: lol
08/04/2019, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: cheers though
08/04/2019, 23:19 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
08/04/2019, 23:20 - Stefan;: Important to know exactly how many people got shat on. Glad they took time to do the headcount
08/04/2019, 23:21 - Rob;: Yeah that's excellent
08/04/2019, 23:22 - Rob;: Perhaps like when an atrocity unfolds there were initial, lower reports of the shitted-upon, and it slowly climbed to this point
08/04/2019, 23:29 - Stefan;: "The number of confirmed beshitted is currently 11, but this is an initial estimate and could rise significantly as further reports come in"
08/04/2019, 23:52 - David;: 'many more are reported missing but at this stage any hopes by their loved ones that they avoided a shit smearing appear increasingly forlorn'
09/04/2019, 08:16 - Damian Rumble: https://www.sexolution-festival.com/ just going to leave this here...
09/04/2019, 08:18 - Paul;: Going to be full of fat basement dwellers. Bet
09/04/2019, 09:17 - Sam;: Of course it’s German. The fiends
09/04/2019, 10:10 - Paul;: Bbc praising fleabag finale as “perfect” - rob can you elaborate?
09/04/2019, 10:11 - Paul;: “One fan said they were so impressed with one of the characters speeches in the final scenes, that they typed it out and might even print it out and put it in a frame”
09/04/2019, 10:14 - David;: Thought it was poor. It's got annoying and smug and self-satisfied now
09/04/2019, 10:15 - David;: The buzz got to it
09/04/2019, 10:34 - Rob;: Why me?
09/04/2019, 10:35 - Paul;: You’re Yentob
09/04/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: And big hype man of fleabag
09/04/2019, 10:42 - Paul;: Buzz raiser
09/04/2019, 10:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Thought it was an above average episode but a terrible end of season episode. Tied up nothing and seemed very chuffed with that
09/04/2019, 10:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Had it been the penultimate episode I'd have given it a 8/10
09/04/2019, 10:44 - Rob;: I enjoyed the series about as much as the first
09/04/2019, 10:47 - Rob;: The level of coverage has been a bit mad for a sit com, but you can't let buzz ruin you enjoying a show
09/04/2019, 10:56 - Paul;: Buzz ruins all
09/04/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: Being so buzz-averse is basically being a snob
09/04/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: You're allowed to like popular things
09/04/2019, 11:00 - David;: Nah but buzz is not popularity - it's where something becomes too big to fail.
09/04/2019, 11:01 - David;: Don't like things that you have to like because they are too big to fail.
09/04/2019, 11:03 - Stefan;: Dave, watching sitcoms isn't like banks and the financial crisis
09/04/2019, 11:05 - David;: There's a lot of moral hazard around fleabag - critics feel they can support it because the taxpayer/public will bail them out as buzzer of last resort.
09/04/2019, 11:05 - Sam;: We all have to like fleabag in order to keep Barclays afloat
09/04/2019, 11:05 - David;: So the buzz is being mispriced
09/04/2019, 11:06 - Rob;: I just enjoyed watching it and I'm quite glad I'm not watching TV in the way you are Dave
09/04/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: It sounds exhausting
09/04/2019, 11:07 - Sam;: Thorgan, Eden and Moral
09/04/2019, 11:07 - David;: Well I'm mainly not watching.
09/04/2019, 11:07 - Sam;: The brothers Hazard
09/04/2019, 11:16 - Paul;: Robs going to default on his buzz soon
09/04/2019, 11:17 - David;: 'Sub-prime buzz prices will never fall' - Rob Goodway, August 2008
09/04/2019, 11:21 - Paul;: Line of duty, anyone been watching that?
09/04/2019, 11:27 - Paul;: About to get surrounded by buzz. But predictable plot. Same old shite
09/04/2019, 11:42 - Damian Rumble: Dave. Such a hipster. The moment something becomes mainstream it is ruined. TV. Music. Bread. Where will it end?
09/04/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: I don’t think you understand the buzz
09/04/2019, 12:34 - David;: Buzz ≠ Popularity
09/04/2019, 12:39 - / James Ball: Buzz = people telling you to like something and it becoming popular because it's popular not because it's actually groundbreaking or good
09/04/2019, 13:25 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
09/04/2019, 13:26 - David;: 'potat'
09/04/2019, 16:38 - Jack G;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-47864761

Why didn’t he just drink water?
09/04/2019, 20:01 - / James Ball: potat
09/04/2019, 20:01 - Phill: Just had potat with Ben and chedr for tea.
09/04/2019, 20:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Honk
09/04/2019, 20:15 - David;: Hib
09/04/2019, 20:17 - David;: Porto are a team of troll fake names
09/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: Torres, Suarez and Danillo
09/04/2019, 20:18 - Phill: DAT marega.
09/04/2019, 20:18 - Phill: So quick.
09/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: None of them the actual versions of those players
09/04/2019, 20:23 - David;: They also have Pereira, Costa and Dos Santos on the bench - not the ones you would expect
10/04/2019, 11:41 - Paul;: Sam, united going to throw the city game so Liverpool can’t win?
10/04/2019, 11:43 - David;: Would be very embarassing for them but they have the small club mentality that would make them do that.
10/04/2019, 11:44 - David;: Contented being the second biggest club in their town.
10/04/2019, 12:09 - Jack G;: >town

10/04/2019, 12:54 - David;: Small game
10/04/2019, 12:54 - Jack G;: Looking forward to seeing what faces Messi can make Phil Jones pull
10/04/2019, 13:39 - David;: Damo is your anus ready for the black hole picture?
10/04/2019, 13:40 - David;: Is your shit hole ready for the black hole?
10/04/2019, 13:42 - Stefan;: So pumped to look at a photo of nothing
10/04/2019, 13:43 - Stefan;: But which contains everything
10/04/2019, 13:50 - David;: Will it not just be black surrounded by black? Could be underwhelming
10/04/2019, 13:51 - Paul;: Surely an April fools that’s gone too far?
10/04/2019, 14:01 - David;: <Media omitted>

10/04/2019, 14:21 - Stefan;: 6 years to produce this
10/04/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: Looks like it was taken with a disposable camera. 0/10
10/04/2019, 14:24 - David;: '"Wow - they've really done it!" said Professor Reynolds. "I really didn't expect the image to be as clear - just like the computer simulations"'
10/04/2019, 14:33 - Paul;: lol complete piece of shut
10/04/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: *shit

10/04/2019, 14:39 - Paul;: An Andy Carroll
10/04/2019, 14:48 - / James Ball: I'm not sure what people were expecting. Clearly not the headline that "black hole appears as lightless black disc on film"
10/04/2019, 14:51 - Rob;: They had a huge build up to it, a long press embargo, which usually means it's going to be good
10/04/2019, 14:51 - David;: Yeah, just quietly release it. Bad expectation management
10/04/2019, 14:52 - / James Ball: God, the BBC's reporting of it is fucking wank
10/04/2019, 14:52 - / James Ball: It's a "million trillion" km away
10/04/2019, 14:52 - / James Ball: You're not Brian Cox
10/04/2019, 14:53 - Paul;: Looking to justify their existence with all these scientific things now they lost Pluto
10/04/2019, 14:53 - David;: Lol, 'lost pluto'
10/04/2019, 14:54 - David;: They got the photograph of that though
10/04/2019, 14:54 - David;: Less lost than it has ever been
10/04/2019, 14:55 - / James Ball: They sent a craft specifically towards it
10/04/2019, 14:55 - Paul;: Pluto got demoted
10/04/2019, 14:56 - / James Ball: True but it's still around
10/04/2019, 14:56 - David;: Yeah, nothing about it changed. That was scientists changing their own classification system.
10/04/2019, 14:56 - David;: Not like they were desperately trying to hold onto it but told they could no longer have it.
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: It is quite small
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Paul;: It’s shit. Tiny. Get rid

10/04/2019, 14:57 - David;: Would be good if it was actually put there. Brazil having to deal with that.
10/04/2019, 14:57 - Paul;: Can’t believe they got away with calling it a planet
10/04/2019, 14:57 - David;: 'sorry m8'
10/04/2019, 14:59 - / James Ball: You don't mind if I leave my minor planetoid here so you - I'll only be a minute
10/04/2019, 14:59 - David;: Dat sphere though. Round m8 - not an asteroid is it?
10/04/2019, 15:00 - David;: I miss pluto being a planet, it was a planet back in my day. It's political correctness gone mad.
10/04/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: Also, getting pluto as it's god when it turns out it has a heart on it is shit
10/04/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: It should have been Venus
10/04/2019, 15:05 - Rob;: And Neptune not having any seas is shit
10/04/2019, 15:06 - David;: So blue though. Perfect.
10/04/2019, 15:06 - Rob;: You'd redo most of the names
10/04/2019, 15:06 - Stefan;: Jupiter - not very jolly
10/04/2019, 15:06 - David;: blue and flat - classic sea-like vibe
10/04/2019, 15:06 - Stefan;: Has a massive storm that's been going for hundreds of years
10/04/2019, 15:06 - David;: Mercury works, Mars works. Lock those down.
10/04/2019, 15:07 - Rob;: Saturn is more jolly with its rings, yet to be saturnine is to be gloomy
10/04/2019, 15:07 - David;: But jupiter the god of thunder. Ideal.
10/04/2019, 15:07 - David;: Lots of thunder knocking about up there.
10/04/2019, 15:13 - Rob;: So what's the light being emitted?
10/04/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: Just gas it's pulling in, apparently
10/04/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: Thank god for the bright gas
10/04/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: “At the event horizon, light is bent  in a perfect loop around the black hole, meaning if you stood there you would be able to see the back of your own head”
10/04/2019, 15:18 - Stefan;: That "if" is doing a lot of heavy lifting there
10/04/2019, 15:19 - David;: Frousting down into an event horizon
10/04/2019, 15:19 - David;: Waking up really hungover and you're perched on an event horizon
10/04/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: The time dilation would turn it into a thousand year froust
10/04/2019, 15:20 - / James Ball: Probably travelling at near light speed with infinite mass to boot
10/04/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: The infinite froust
10/04/2019, 15:22 - Paul;: Didn’t we already have one of those?
10/04/2019, 15:22 - / James Ball: Infinite mass after an infinite froust sound quite plausible
10/04/2019, 15:22 - David;: Jack, you wake up on brutally hung over and you're in a small swimming pool with a humpback whale. How do you deal with it?
10/04/2019, 15:23 - David;: We had the thousand year balloon
10/04/2019, 15:24 - Jack G;: I assume the black hole has somehow transported me into an alternate dimension, hopefully a utopian one
10/04/2019, 15:25 - Rob;: Since that balloon I've always felt like the people in Inception who've lived entire lifetimes within their own conciousness
10/04/2019, 15:25 - Rob;: There was that other long one where Damian cried out 'FUCCKKKKK' at the height of it and it lasted for decades
10/04/2019, 15:25 - David;: It really blew the cobwebs off
10/04/2019, 16:14 - Damian Rumble: I'm pretty sure the image of this black hole was what I was hallucinating that day....
10/04/2019, 16:16 - Damian Rumble: Fun fact, I actually operated one of the telescopes used in this observation during my PhD.
10/04/2019, 16:17 - Paul;: A funner fact than splitting in half via anus to mouth in 2D world
10/04/2019, 16:18 - Stefan;: Great hallucination.
10/04/2019, 16:18 - Stefan;: A cocktail of psychedelics and all your mind produced was a some fuzzy green around a black circle
10/04/2019, 16:20 - Damian Rumble: Well that and also Stefan with 8 eyes, 6 mouths and 3 noses....

11/04/2019, 14:29 - Damian Rumble: "S2 is a star that is located close to the radio source Sagittarius A*, orbiting it with an orbital period of 16.0518 years, a semi-major axis of about 970 au, and ... coming no closer than about four times the distance of Neptune from the Sun.
11/04/2019, 14:29 - Damian Rumble: There's your answer
11/04/2019, 14:30 - Paul;: Can you translate it into a real answer?
11/04/2019, 14:31 - David;: That makes sense. Still quite close - orbiting every 16 light years. Big risk of being sucked into the event horizon there surely
11/04/2019, 14:31 - David;: Big froust on S2, observing the black hole in the sky
11/04/2019, 14:31 - David;: *years
11/04/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: Do we have a planet we can froust on though?
11/04/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: Can’t froust on a star
11/04/2019, 14:35 - David;: There must be a litttle planet knocking about around it
11/04/2019, 14:35 - David;: A grotty hot jupiter or something
11/04/2019, 14:37 - Paul;: We can just settle in there?
11/04/2019, 14:42 - David;: Given a recent estimate of 4.31 million M☉ for the mass of the Sagittarius A* black hole and S2's close approach, this makes S2 the fastest known ballistic orbit, reaching speeds exceeding 5,000 km/s (11,000,000 mph, or 1/60 the speed of light) and acceleration of about 1.5 m/s2 (almost one-sixth of Earth's surface gravity).
11/04/2019, 14:42 - Rob;: Maybe in winter you would be ominously closer to the black hole
11/04/2019, 14:42 - David;: Would be frousting at 1/60th the speed of light
11/04/2019, 14:45 - David;: In 2012, a star called S0–102 was found to be orbiting even closer to the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole than does S0-2. At one-sixteenth the brightness of S0-2, S0-102 was not initially recognized because it required many more years of observations to distinguish it from its local infrared background. S0-102 has an orbital period of 11.5 years, even shorter than that of S0-2.
11/04/2019, 14:46 - David;: Very close that.
11/04/2019, 14:47 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/04/2019, 14:48 - David;: Excellent froust vantage point. Few bevvies and watch the black hole going past
11/04/2019, 14:50 - Rob;: Would orbiting a sun that's orbiting a black hole with a big disc of glazing gas around it mean you don't have a regular day/night cycle
11/04/2019, 14:51 - Rob;: *glowing gas
11/04/2019, 14:52 - Damian Rumble: I think that might be the least of your problems...
11/04/2019, 14:52 - Damian Rumble: 120 X as far as the earth is from the sun
11/04/2019, 14:55 - David;: What would be the main problems?
11/04/2019, 14:56 - David;: Don't see the issue
11/04/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: As long as you're just far out enough not be sucked in, what problems is it actually causing?
11/04/2019, 14:58 - David;: Would be fine, can't forsee any problems
11/04/2019, 14:58 - Jack G;: Just wear a space suit, will be fine
11/04/2019, 14:59 - Rob;: You just get to see loads of gas whizzing around and a big black disc of nothing/everything
11/04/2019, 15:00 - Damian Rumble: Probably the continuous stream of x-rays/gamma rays coming out of the super heated infalling mater as it crosses the event horizon
11/04/2019, 15:00 - David;: Ah. Well.
11/04/2019, 15:01 - Rob;: But that's 12x further away than the sun
11/04/2019, 15:01 - David;: Just more to look at.
11/04/2019, 15:01 - Rob;: And nothing escapes an event horizon, famously
11/04/2019, 15:01 - David;: X-Rays used in medicine anyway - good for you if anything
11/04/2019, 15:02 - David;: Would just see through everyone it would be a good gimick for the night
11/04/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: Yeah. A world where you'll spot a broken bone with ease
11/04/2019, 15:03 - David;: 120 - even safer
11/04/2019, 15:05 - Rob;: You probably struggle to even get a tan
11/04/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: Is your anus ready for the James Webb space telescope?
11/04/2019, 15:21 - / James Ball: Because your skin would melt off due to radiation?
11/04/2019, 15:22 - / James Ball: Didn't realise Assange was carried out of the embassy like a pasty battering ram
11/04/2019, 15:22 - / James Ball: Thought he walked out
11/04/2019, 15:31 - David;: No. Directly observing exoplanets. Can't get close to that
11/04/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Probably going to have the capability to detect life on other planets... If they ever build the damn thing...
11/04/2019, 15:41 - David;: Why aren't we already targetting radio messages to the nearest habitable-looking exoplanets
11/04/2019, 15:42 - David;: Just get the ball rolling, they'll take ages to get there anyway
11/04/2019, 15:42 - Paul;: Good point
11/04/2019, 15:47 - Rob;: I think we're doing a bit of that
11/04/2019, 15:47 - Rob;: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_interstellar_radio_messages?wprov=sfla1
11/04/2019, 15:48 - Rob;: What would you say, if you were writing an interstellar message?
11/04/2019, 15:55 - Paul;: One of our messages we sent won’t arrive until 25974
11/04/2019, 15:55 - Paul;: Sent it in 1974
11/04/2019, 15:57 - Rob;: So if they reply immediately we'll hear back in 3174?
11/04/2019, 15:58 - Rob;: No, lol
11/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: In 49974
11/04/2019, 15:58 - Rob;: Would be great if they spend ages learning an earth language so they could reply, then we can't understand it by the time it arrives
11/04/2019, 16:05 - Damian Rumble: If there were any intelligent lifeforms within a reasonable distance to us we would have already have picked up thier passive Comms (for example TV and radio) by now (and them us)
11/04/2019, 16:08 - Rob;: Only if they're further ahead technologically by the number of light years away they are
11/04/2019, 16:09 - Rob;: If they're 9999 years ahead technologically but 10,000 light years away we'll get it next year
11/04/2019, 16:10 - Rob;: Or maybe they sent it to use before we built anything to receive it
11/04/2019, 16:13 - Rob;: Could be a lot of life that's been and gone
11/04/2019, 16:16 - David;: I read somewhere that untargetted signals like that would only be detectable 0.25 light years away so not enough to pick up
11/04/2019, 16:18 - David;: They could well have died out in the time it takes for their reply signal to get here anyway.
11/04/2019, 16:20 - David;: But this is fuck all. 20 in total over decades. We should be constantly spamming out messages to the nearest ones. Go for volume.
11/04/2019, 16:24 - Rob;: Do TV and Radio signals just get spaffed out?
11/04/2019, 16:24 - Damian Rumble: Take all of the shit memes @447540496004  has produced on the thread and channel it straight at  alpha centuri. It's the strongest signal we have...
11/04/2019, 16:26 - David;: No, they don't go out far enough - not the sufficient strength etc.
11/04/2019, 16:29 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/04/2019, 16:29 - David;: This is one we sent out in 1974 apparently. Would tell you fuck all.
11/04/2019, 16:29 - David;: Would not respond to that piece of shit if I was an alien
11/04/2019, 16:35 - Stefan;: How can it be indefinitely dense but also have a measurable size (which is a lot bigger than the solar system)?
11/04/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Sorry?
11/04/2019, 16:36 - Paul;: Rather straightforward once you know how to read it
11/04/2019, 16:42 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
11/04/2019, 16:47 - Rob;: Why did he fail?
11/04/2019, 16:49 - Stefan;: "Michael Shrimpton, who also has a conviction for possessing indecent images of children, was handed a 12-month jail sentence back in 2015 over a hoax call to the Ministry of Defence. The ex-Tanfield Chambers advocate told officials that terrorists had retrieved a nuclear weapon from a sunken Russian submarine and were plotting an attack on Her Majesty during the 2012 London Olympics"
11/04/2019, 16:49 - David;: Pass
11/04/2019, 16:49 - Stefan;: Can't understand why he failed
11/04/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: Shrimpy
11/04/2019, 16:59 - Paul;: lol his Wikipedia page is complete chaos
11/04/2019, 17:03 - David;: Lol yeah there's a lot going on there
11/04/2019, 19:31 - Sam;: Kane is fucked
11/04/2019, 19:31 - Sam;: Might not even be back for uefa nations
11/04/2019, 19:32 - Jack G;: Rashford striker no problem
11/04/2019, 19:32 - Jack G;: Dat Rashford, Sancho, Sterling front three
11/04/2019, 19:33 - Sam;: Yeah, could unleash them, like Son for spurs.
11/04/2019, 19:34 - Sam;: The done side of the traditional CF like Kane, others find it harder to flourish unless they are supporting the CF
11/04/2019, 19:34 - Damian Rumble: http://newsthump.com/2019/04/11/tv-fans-delighted-as-brexit-renewed-for-another-season/
11/04/2019, 19:34 - Jack G;: Yeah definitely. With a striker like Kane got to build the team around him or he is anonymous
11/04/2019, 19:37 - Sam;: Big news for Liverpool, Arsenal and hammers fans

Midfielder Benayoun announces retirement
http://www.premierleague.com/news/1174091
11/04/2019, 20:15 - Jack G;: Lovely goal there
11/04/2019, 20:16 - Jack G;: Would watch again
11/04/2019, 20:30 - Sam;: Fair few millios taken off of koulibalys value there
11/04/2019, 20:32 - Jack G;: Down to a measly 98 million then
11/04/2019, 20:33 - Jack G;: Wonder how it effected the petrol index
11/04/2019, 23:05 - David;: Alli as well
12/04/2019, 08:59 - Paul;: Lol, sun reporting Assange was engaging in dirty protests at the embassy. Whiffyleaks
12/04/2019, 09:12 - Paul;: Only place in the world you’re safe. Best to shit everywhere
12/04/2019, 09:29 - / James Ball: Well he had been there for 7 years, he must have been griming up the walls
12/04/2019, 09:35 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
12/04/2019, 09:37 - Rob;: Has that made Markle fitter for you, Dave?
12/04/2019, 10:19 - Damian Rumble: Basically served a prison sentence.... To avoid serving a prison sentence
12/04/2019, 10:20 - Rob;: Which he might serve anyway
12/04/2019, 10:20 - Rob;: He had a cat though
12/04/2019, 10:35 - Paul;: Apparently they got fed up with him. He was skateboarding and playing football in the corridors. Also he smelt of shit. Said he had bad hygiene one very unpleasant related to digestion
12/04/2019, 10:38 - David;: >skateboarding
12/04/2019, 10:39 - Paul;: A shitty man living in your house for 7 years
12/04/2019, 10:40 - David;: 'after spending seven years in the country's embassy he had dismissed Ecuador by describing it as an insignificant country'
12/04/2019, 10:40 - David;: Also unwise
12/04/2019, 10:41 - Paul;: High levels of autism
12/04/2019, 10:43 - David;: Just had a 7 year froust. That catches up on you
12/04/2019, 10:44 - Rob;: But in someone else's workplace
12/04/2019, 10:45 - Rob;: A place where everyone else tends to dress very smartly
12/04/2019, 10:48 - David;: 'one very unpleasant related to digestion'? Are you Damian in disguise?
12/04/2019, 11:39 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
12/04/2019, 11:39 - David;: >eating a penguin in 2019
12/04/2019, 12:15 - Jack G;: Yeah penguins are trash tier for chocolate bars
12/04/2019, 12:17 - Sam;: Nah they’re a staple. Penguin for mains, Rocky for pudding
12/04/2019, 12:25 - / James Ball: False. Penguins are up there
12/04/2019, 12:26 - / James Ball: Club and rocky also good
12/04/2019, 12:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Penguin, cut of opposite corners and use it as a straw to suck tea through 👌
12/04/2019, 12:27 - / James Ball: Witchcraft
12/04/2019, 12:27 - Paul;: What’s your top tier?
12/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: Wait explain the logistics on this
12/04/2019, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: You end up with a perfectly formed tea soaked biscuit, better than it sounds
12/04/2019, 12:29 - David;: you'd need to hollow out the centre
12/04/2019, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah just suck
12/04/2019, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Also works with other chocolate covered buscuits
12/04/2019, 12:29 - David;: Hmm, might need to see photographic evidence
12/04/2019, 12:32 - Jack G;: Kit Kat, Snickers
12/04/2019, 12:32 - Sam;: Of Hamish sucking on his biscuits?
12/04/2019, 12:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Can you no suck tea through a nougat based snack
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Mars bar/snickers = disaster
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Jack G;: Being able to suck tea through it not really a selling point for me
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Paul;: Fucking mental
12/04/2019, 12:33 - Paul;: Do you even chocolate jack
12/04/2019, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: 1. Double decker
2. Boost
3. Twirl
12/04/2019, 12:34 - David;: You've lost your mind
12/04/2019, 12:35 - David;: Galaxy Ripple - very under-rated.
12/04/2019, 12:35 - Paul;: Starbar
12/04/2019, 12:35 - Jack G;: Just a worse version of a twirl
12/04/2019, 12:35 - Paul;: Twirl is like dry husks of wheat. Ripple is sophisticated
12/04/2019, 12:36 - David;: Nah, richer and more cloying
12/04/2019, 12:36 - David;: yeah yeah, creamier.
12/04/2019, 12:36 - David;: The best chocolate bar of all time has in fact been discontinued - the cadbury snowflake
12/04/2019, 12:38 - Sam;: Used to enjoy a fuse back in the day
12/04/2019, 12:41 - David;: was that with little fizzy bits of honeycomb in?
12/04/2019, 12:42 - David;: Spira's were good - also discontinued
12/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Snickers and Mars are sugary, American mess.
12/04/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: Lion bar
12/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: I do have a soft spot for an Aero but it needs to be fridge cooled
12/04/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Lion bar is underrated
12/04/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Kit Kat chunky is a proper undertaking
12/04/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: I have always enjoyed a Twix. Often good value in a vending machine scenario thanks to its double bar structure
12/04/2019, 12:53 - Damian Rumble: Heresy
12/04/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Very dense but I think I liked them a lot
12/04/2019, 12:54 - / James Ball: I used to go swimming and end with a twix or a wagon wheel from the vending machine. I still enjoy both but they make me hallucinate the smell of chlorine. Memories.
12/04/2019, 12:54 - Rob;: I'll back this
12/04/2019, 12:55 - Rob;: 'I still enjoy them but they make me hallucinate chlorine' - get that review on the packet
12/04/2019, 12:55 - / James Ball: I'll send an email to the marketing team
12/04/2019, 12:56 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
12/04/2019, 12:57 - David;: I always carry some plasters with me
12/04/2019, 12:57 - Paul;: Yorkie = trash, picnic = trash
12/04/2019, 12:59 - / James Ball: Yorkie has definitely fallen by the wayside for me over the years. I don't have enough picnic experience
12/04/2019, 12:59 - Rob;: How extreme do you reckon those Chewit Xtremes are?
12/04/2019, 12:59 - David;: The Reese peanut cups can get incredibly close. So much sugar.
12/04/2019, 13:00 - / James Ball: PB cups are addictive. Wispa is pretty god tier for me
12/04/2019, 13:01 - Jack G;: Wispas go down well. Anything with caramel is a no from me
12/04/2019, 13:11 - David;: Yeah wispa is a solid choice
12/04/2019, 13:11 - David;: absolute worst thing is Cadbury fruit and nut
12/04/2019, 13:11 - David;: Would rather eat ash
12/04/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: Cadbury Fruit and Ash is ok
12/04/2019, 13:19 - Paul;: >Milkyway
12/04/2019, 13:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Would prefer Cadbury fruit and no nut
12/04/2019, 13:28 - Paul;: I prefer a flan
12/04/2019, 13:39 - Rob;: A Cadbury Fruit and Bollock
12/04/2019, 14:07 - Phill: Can vouch for viability of penguin straw
12/04/2019, 14:07 - Phill: Works
12/04/2019, 14:10 - Phill: CRUNCHIE GOAT
12/04/2019, 14:10 - Phill: WISPA GOAT
12/04/2019, 14:10 - Phill: >BOUNTY
12/04/2019, 14:10 - Phill: >MARS
12/04/2019, 14:11 - David;: Love a bounty
12/04/2019, 14:11 - Rob;: No
12/04/2019, 14:13 - Phill: >loves bounty
12/04/2019, 14:13 - Phill: >hates fruit and nut
12/04/2019, 14:13 - Phill: Full retard.
12/04/2019, 14:17 - Paul;: Disgusting
12/04/2019, 14:17 - Paul;: Like eating gritty potpourri
12/04/2019, 14:19 - David;: >fruit and nut
12/04/2019, 14:20 - David;: Refreshing burst of coconut what's not to like?
12/04/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: If I want to be refreshed I’d have an orange not a chocolate bar
12/04/2019, 14:22 - Rob;: I'd have a drink
12/04/2019, 14:23 - Sam;: Has any ever pissed back through their legs, stood up? 10/10. would recommend
12/04/2019, 14:24 - Rob;: Thanks for the tip
12/04/2019, 14:24 - Rob;: I did piss through Paul's legs while he was pissing that time
12/04/2019, 14:25 - Sam;: Should have tried it with you both backwards
12/04/2019, 14:25 - David;: Like an awful family circus act
12/04/2019, 15:21 - Damian Rumble: No
12/04/2019, 15:22 - Damian Rumble: This from a man who likes to cook his pizza by leaving out in the sun for 5mins...
12/04/2019, 15:31 - David;: I decline to take culinary advice from a cider-filled pringles can.
12/04/2019, 15:39 - Paul;: Wrapped in the ft and controlled by wire
12/04/2019, 15:45 - Phill: Dave's favourite flavours: 
Raw bacon
2-minute pizza, cooked upside down
Marmite and butter paste
12/04/2019, 15:46 - David;: Where's the pizza thing come from? I would never underdo a pizza unless horribly pissed
12/04/2019, 15:46 - David;: Then mistakes can happen to anyone
12/04/2019, 15:46 - Hamish Sinclair: I distinctly remember eating pasta and ketchup at your house for years
12/04/2019, 15:47 - Paul;: Had pasta and ketchup last weekend. Classic meal
12/04/2019, 15:48 - Jack G;: Sounds disgusting, get a pasta sauce at least
12/04/2019, 15:49 - Paul;: Ketchup = pasta sauce
12/04/2019, 15:49 - Jack G;: It’s a condiment
12/04/2019, 15:50 - Paul;: Tomatoes. Sauce. Pasta.
12/04/2019, 15:50 - Jack G;: Enjoy your shitty meal
12/04/2019, 15:50 - David;: That is great. Doesn't sound like it but it works.
12/04/2019, 15:51 - Rob;: Show that to the Italians
12/04/2019, 15:51 - David;: Also this would have been when we were c. 12 or 13
12/04/2019, 15:51 - Rob;: Here's what we did with your national dish
12/04/2019, 15:52 - David;: I'd shove their shitty fries and weak tea right back in their face
12/04/2019, 15:52 - Rob;: We made sure to cook the pasta until it was white, bloated and mushy
12/04/2019, 15:53 - David;: Also you've embarrassed yourself because simple pasta toppings are now all the rage.
12/04/2019, 15:55 - David;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fettuccine_Alfredo
12/04/2019, 15:56 - David;: case in point. just have it with butter and cheese.
12/04/2019, 15:56 - Jack G;: There’s no arguement for this Dave. Pasta and ketchup is clearly and abomination
12/04/2019, 15:56 - Damian Rumble: I definitely remember @447526575752 describing Dave as liking his pizza 'enemic' one wales

12/04/2019, 15:58 - Paul;: Pasta ketchup and cheese is too high brow for your simple tastes
12/04/2019, 15:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Enemic would suggest "like an enema" which visually would be quite different
12/04/2019, 15:59 - David;: It's okay, we know.
12/04/2019, 15:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Truly awful
12/04/2019, 16:00 - David;: You keep the pasta al dente and put a bit of butter in as well. Parmesan on top.
12/04/2019, 16:08 - Phill: With Dave on this. Sorry, plebs.
12/04/2019, 16:13 - David;: https://www.justonecookbook.com/ketchup-spaghetti-recipe/

There are a few theories of how Spaghetti Napolitan (or Naporitan) or Ketchup Spaghetti originated.  The strongest theory is that it’s originated in Yokohama during the post war.  Around 1950s, the head chef at the New Grand Hotel in Yokohama created this recipe when he was inspired by the spaghetti and tomato sauce dish served for the American military. Since tomato sauce was a rare ingredient, so ketchup was used as a substitute for the pasta. He then named it Spaghetti Napolitan, or napoli, after Naples, Italy.

These newly westernized dishes like Spaghetti Meat Sauce and Spaghetti Napolitan received amazing responses that they became mainstays in the cafes and Japanese home kitchens. To this day, the two dishes are still two of the most popular western influenced pastas in Japan.
12/04/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: Agree with al dente pasta with simple toppings 100%, just not ketchup
12/04/2019, 16:15 - Rob;: Not being influenced by the Japanese on that
12/04/2019, 16:16 - Paul;: Stay pleb
12/04/2019, 16:17 - Jack G;: Even a can of chopped tomatoes with salt & pepper is a hundred times better than ketchup
12/04/2019, 16:18 - Jack G;: Bit of basil
12/04/2019, 16:18 - Rob;: Ketchup is 22% sugar

13/04/2019, 15:13 - Phill: Red liecester as well. DAT sweet richness.
13/04/2019, 15:21 - David;: I went with some artisanal ketchup sourced from my local italian-run independent food store. Lurpak spreadable counter-balances the sweetness of the ketchup while the red Leicester adds a British twist to this classic japanese-italian fusion dish.

13/04/2019, 18:02 - Jack G;: Used to it, refs hate us
13/04/2019, 18:16 - David;: The backpass rule shouldn't be based on intent. Discuss.
13/04/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: How would you judge a deflection?
13/04/2019, 18:19 - Rob;: Because if a backpass is just any ball off your own player, then a keeper might have to parry a goal-bound deflection when they could catch it
13/04/2019, 18:19 - David;: Yeah I guess. I just think there are so many examples of people deliberately miscuing it - benefit of the doubt always seems to go with the defender
13/04/2019, 18:20 - Rob;: Yeah, there are moments like that
13/04/2019, 18:21 - David;: Maybe only exception is where the ball is goal bound before the defender touches it
13/04/2019, 18:21 - Phill: How to judge intent? Lawyer in the VAR room?
13/04/2019, 18:21 - David;: Deals with deflections
13/04/2019, 18:21 - Hamish Sinclair: The rule was brought in to stop easy possession football patterns of keeper to full back, full back to keeper etc
13/04/2019, 18:22 - David;: Yeah that's what I mean though - why it should be changed as can never be properly enforced as it is
13/04/2019, 18:22 - Rob;: It would also be a bit shit if you make a goal-saving tackle and the ball spills out and the keeper has to control it with their feet with players looking for a tap-in
13/04/2019, 18:23 - David;: Would make for excitement and more goals
13/04/2019, 18:23 - Phill: 6 yard box, keeper can use hands, 18 yard box keeper can't.

13/04/2019, 18:24 - Phill: Can do pass backs if keeper in 6yd box

13/04/2019, 22:10 - Rob;: Maybe it's better fresh
13/04/2019, 22:11 - Phill: Seaweed is fine fresh. In its own right. But when some cunt says "try this dries seaweed instead of salt" they can castrate themselves.
13/04/2019, 22:11 - Rob;: Salt and pepper don't need to be replaced
13/04/2019, 22:11 - Rob;: Added to, fine
13/04/2019, 22:12 - Phill: Salting the seaweed is fine.
13/04/2019, 22:12 - Phill: Seaweeding the salt is not.

13/04/2019, 22:30 - David;: Have I gone mental - surely it is only the sea salt on seaweed that makes it taste salty? So why would it ever be a way to reduce your salt intake?
13/04/2019, 22:31 - David;: 'Do you want to eat less salt in your diet? Why not try replacing salt with this thing that is also covered in salt'
13/04/2019, 22:34 - Paul;: Surely we’ve gone mental and should just brine all foods we want to be salty in a cup of seawater over night rather than extracting salt from water
13/04/2019, 22:35 - Rob;: Canarian potatoes are boiled in sea water until all the liquid is gone and they're crusted with salt
13/04/2019, 22:36 - Rob;: And therefore fucking delicious
13/04/2019, 22:36 - Paul;: We’re doing salt wrong
13/04/2019, 22:37 - David;: Cut out the middle man - go straight to the seawater.
13/04/2019, 22:37 - Paul;: Water water everywhere
13/04/2019, 22:38 - Rob;: Sea water hard to come by in much of the country

13/04/2019, 22:38 - Rob;: Salt easier to transport
13/04/2019, 22:38 - David;: So we're wanting pure water and pure salt - but then we just combine them in meals anyway. Why not just drink seawater with meals. Can't see any problem with that.
13/04/2019, 22:39 - David;: But the salt's coming from the sea anyway Rob
13/04/2019, 22:39 - Paul;: And you get water for free
13/04/2019, 22:39 - David;: So you're transporting it to a plant to make salt and then transporting the salt
13/04/2019, 22:40 - Paul;: Train to watch train
13/04/2019, 22:40 - David;: Has anyone actually tried soaking everything in seawater or are we just going on the old wives tale that you can't drink it?
13/04/2019, 22:41 - Paul;: Don’t think it’s been tested
13/04/2019, 22:41 - David;: A lot of outdated information holding us back
13/04/2019, 22:41 - Paul;: I eat salt I drink water ergo let me have sea water
13/04/2019, 22:42 - Rob;: Ok, you're right
13/04/2019, 22:42 - Rob;: I'll get sea water shipped and stop buying salt
13/04/2019, 22:42 - David;: Yeah - have both of them seperately all the time. Just save one step in the process
13/04/2019, 22:42 - Paul;: If we can pipe in fresh water with all difficult treatment; just pipe in sea water
13/04/2019, 22:43 - Paul;: Cost saving. Twice as useful
13/04/2019, 22:43 - Paul;: Add pepper as its piped in
13/04/2019, 22:43 - David;: The amount of truck hours and petrol that would be saved in delivering all the salt

13/04/2019, 22:44 - Paul;: Add generic spices
13/04/2019, 22:44 - Rob;: Exploring the world by ship would have gone so much better if they'd just ignored that stupid wives' tale and drunk the water
13/04/2019, 22:44 - Paul;: No one uses all the nutmeg or cinnamon
13/04/2019, 22:44 - David;: And a few potatoes and beef come in through the tap as well

16/04/2019, 17:42 - Paul;: Doth your butt hurteth?

Shame I was rather hoping for a new layout to the Shangri-la section...
16/04/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: But how would you get back to your tent after a mad one in shangri-la if it’s moved?
16/04/2019, 18:30 - Rob;: I don't think that means it won't have different content
16/04/2019, 18:31 - Rob;: The apocalypse themed one had the same layout as the heaven and hell themed one, but they had different clubs and bars
16/04/2019, 18:35 - Rob;: It would be shit if it was the same again, agreed
16/04/2019, 19:02 - Phill: Camped at Pennard Hill before. Thoughts? Was quite nice. Near the froust areas.
16/04/2019, 19:06 - Rob;: Yeah I like it. It's the first to fill up as it's renowned as the party place, but worth a try
16/04/2019, 19:08 - Rob;: The last few years I have always ended up at the dairy grounds, which is just the other side of the Park from Pen Hill. It's fine, and great access to one of the carparks, but a bit far from Pyramid
16/04/2019, 19:10 - Phill: Basically, just want somewhere on the quieter side
16/04/2019, 19:10 - Rob;: I've also camped on the hill sort of opposite pyramid too, think it's called Michael's Mead. I think uni mates have a preference for there
16/04/2019, 19:10 - Rob;: Probs not penard hill them
16/04/2019, 19:11 - Phill: I remember it being alright last time.
16/04/2019, 19:11 - Phill: Was 21 and on Mandy most of the weekend so that could be it
16/04/2019, 19:12 - Rob;: I don't really care much as long as we have space, it's not an obvious flood plain and it's not 24 he rave central
16/04/2019, 19:12 - Rob;: It will probably just come down to who gets there first and where they first see a good spot
16/04/2019, 19:13 - Rob;: I have too many separate groups going to camp with them all probably. It's hard to know how to play it.
16/04/2019, 19:14 - Phill: Got to be with us Rob. Rob. Rob. Surely. Rob.
16/04/2019, 19:15 - Phill: Rob pls....
16/04/2019, 19:16 - Rob;: I think probably you guys with my sister too
16/04/2019, 19:16 - Rob;: But I bring a Steve with me, which would separate him from my uni group
16/04/2019, 19:17 - Rob;: And he might be travelling with them
16/04/2019, 19:22 - David;: But rooooob. Friends for 8 years.
16/04/2019, 19:23 - Paul;: Please rob. Don’t go rob. Don’t do this
16/04/2019, 19:24 - David;: Oh rob, no come on, dont go.
16/04/2019, 19:24 - Phill: >Friends since day
16/04/2019, 19:24 - Phill: >probably
16/04/2019, 19:25 - Phill: <Media omitted>
16/04/2019, 19:26 - Rob;: I would imagine the same thing will happen as every year. I get there first and sit at the campsite for 12 hours straight defending our space while everyone I know arrives one by one
16/04/2019, 19:27 - David;: Rexit
16/04/2019, 19:27 - Phill: We'll be there first. I challenge you.
16/04/2019, 19:27 - Phill: Bet a pint
16/04/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Cool. Will happily pay a pint to avoid the tent guarding
16/04/2019, 19:28 - Phill: Ok Israel.
16/04/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: My two year old nephew might pop along at some point
16/04/2019, 19:29 - Rob;: Perhaps even my 6 month old niece
16/04/2019, 19:29 - Phill: They bringing gear?
16/04/2019, 19:29 - Phill: Better be.
16/04/2019, 19:30 - Phill: How inflated is weed price there?
16/04/2019, 19:30 - Phill: Took my own last time.

16/04/2019, 19:50 - Sam;: Up at 5am for this one then. Tunnelling my way through a shitty little VPN from Australia
16/04/2019, 19:51 - Sam;: He’s trusting jones over Dalot as shaw is suspended so young to left back
16/04/2019, 19:51 - David;: Do you at least have BT or having to stream?
16/04/2019, 19:51 - Phill: Ju got some fosters?
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: VPN let’s me use my bt sport app. Bt are livid.
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: They don’t have fosters
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: Laugh at us drinking it
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Phill: I know, but you took some right?
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: Your drinking marketing
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: I’m on the Victoria bitter
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: Crown lager
16/04/2019, 19:52 - Sam;: Carlton draught
16/04/2019, 20:03 - David;: Fuck
16/04/2019, 20:04 - David;: Barca just not doing defending then
16/04/2019, 20:12 - Rob;: 'Fred was nibbling'
16/04/2019, 20:19 - David;: Should de Gea do better?

16/04/2019, 20:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah
16/04/2019, 20:21 - Rob;: Is he broken?
16/04/2019, 20:21 - Jack G;: Embarrassing
16/04/2019, 20:22 - David;: Ah. I mean he should do better there you feel
16/04/2019, 20:23 - David;: Karius-esque

16/04/2019, 21:28 - David;: Ajax pissing on them
16/04/2019, 21:28 - Rob;: I love that Ajax are good now
16/04/2019, 21:30 - David;: It's a very good vs evil match
16/04/2019, 21:31 - Jack G;: Delightful
17/04/2019, 00:28 - Damian Rumble: Picking all those Brighton players in their double game week proved to be a total waste of time...
17/04/2019, 07:40 - Rob;: Same
17/04/2019, 07:40 - Rob;: Lost me points
17/04/2019, 07:41 - Hamish Sinclair: 7 conced
17/04/2019, 07:41 - Hamish Sinclair: None scored
17/04/2019, 07:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Loads of cards
17/04/2019, 07:41 - Rob;: Two more games next week to concede even more
17/04/2019, 20:12 - Rob;: Boring. Might switch over to the Liverpool game
17/04/2019, 20:14 - David;: Still watching the LFC game lol
17/04/2019, 20:14 - David;: Loyalty very tested
17/04/2019, 20:17 - David;: Fuck city
17/04/2019, 20:18 - Phill: 3-2 now?
17/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: How is your brain processing who to support with city v Spurs rob?
17/04/2019, 20:18 - David;: Spurs are obviously good and city evil
17/04/2019, 20:19 - Jack G;: That’s easy. Supporting City 100%. Fuck spurs being anywhere near a champions league final
17/04/2019, 20:19 - David;: Lol jack how do you even have Spurs beef?
17/04/2019, 20:20 - Phill: Lol jack fuck off.
17/04/2019, 20:20 - David;: City are obviously cunts
17/04/2019, 20:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah not sure I get this
17/04/2019, 20:20 - Phill: What are you an 11 year old boy who just got into footy?
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Jack G;: Spurs famously biggest “rival” of West Ham in the premier league
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: But arnt arsenal spurs biggest rival?
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Phill: City famously biggest rival of football
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: So your biggest rival doesn't even recognise you
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Jack G;: Yeah but doesn’t mean we can’t hate them too
17/04/2019, 20:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Must be annoying not to be their number 1 rival
17/04/2019, 20:22 - Phill: Like Milwall with Chelsea
17/04/2019, 20:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Chamions league semi finals should be for teams who sell out their stadiums, as a basic rule
17/04/2019, 20:22 - David;: Lol
17/04/2019, 20:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Monaco and city cam fuck off
17/04/2019, 20:22 - David;: A one-directional huge rivalry
17/04/2019, 20:23 - Rob;: I'm essentially a neutral at this stage. I don't want either to win the Champions League, so just supporting goals.
17/04/2019, 20:23 - David;: If City win football loses
17/04/2019, 20:23 - Rob;: Ajax to win
17/04/2019, 20:23 - Jack G;: But at least they have no fans to be cunts about winning
17/04/2019, 20:23 - David;: Yeah Ajax win would be great, but you have to call this match
17/04/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: Perhaps Spurs to win just on the offchance it might make City more likely to beat them at the weekend?
17/04/2019, 20:24 - Phill: No.
17/04/2019, 20:24 - Phill: Need league.
17/04/2019, 20:25 - David;: This fucking argument. 'Id rather a fake club can buy their way to success by being sponsored by an oil dictatorship because there will be no actual fans to care about it'
17/04/2019, 20:25 - David;: Great. Brilliant spectacle
17/04/2019, 20:26 - David;: So essentially take rivalries and passion out of football.
17/04/2019, 20:26 - Rob;: Also Jack, don't you live exactly where _all_ the City fans are
17/04/2019, 20:26 - David;: Because you might sometimes be on the wrong end of it

17/04/2019, 21:36 - David;: They have not ruled this out
17/04/2019, 21:44 - David;: That Eriksen shot
17/04/2019, 21:44 - David;: >game management
17/04/2019, 21:54 - David;: I ❤VAR
17/04/2019, 21:56 - David;: It couldn't have happened to a nicer cardigan
17/04/2019, 21:57 - Rob;: The butthurt City must feel
17/04/2019, 21:57 - David;: This is great
17/04/2019, 21:57 - David;: Yeah, so much worse than just not scoring
17/04/2019, 21:57 - Phill: Fuck off jack fuck off jack fuck off jack
17/04/2019, 21:58 - Paul;: Lol jack
17/04/2019, 21:58 - Jack G;: Why do you care so much that I don’t like spurs?
17/04/2019, 21:59 - Phill: Its not that you don't like spurs, it's that you'd rather city win is what baffles.
17/04/2019, 21:59 - Phill: I don't like Everton. I don't like Chelsea. I don't like United. But I hate city more than them all combined.
17/04/2019, 21:59 - Paul;: Plastic jack
17/04/2019, 22:00 - Jack G;: Absolute bull shit
17/04/2019, 22:00 - Phill: Lol
17/04/2019, 22:00 - David;: If you want city to win over any given real club you're not a real fan
17/04/2019, 22:01 - Jack G;: I never said that. I’d literally support anyone other than spurs or PSG against city
17/04/2019, 22:01 - Phill: But PSG and City are the same thing
17/04/2019, 22:02 - Jack G;: Equally bad but city get the tie breaker courtesy of being an English team
17/04/2019, 22:02 - David;: Psg acceptable because it cancels out. Juve as well.
17/04/2019, 22:02 - David;: But spurs
17/04/2019, 22:02 - Paul;: Didn’t even know west ham and spurs was a rivalry
17/04/2019, 22:03 - Jack G;: It is for West Ham. Not so much for spurs
17/04/2019, 22:03 - David;: Lots of English players, don't spend stupid money etc.
17/04/2019, 22:04 - Rob;: Every team in London hates Spurs
17/04/2019, 22:04 - Phill: Because they're the biggest club?
17/04/2019, 22:04 - Rob;: Chelsea Spurs is probably the worst in terms of fan violence
17/04/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: No it's long standing throughout their dismal history
17/04/2019, 22:05 - Paul;: It’s like your other huge rivalry with Juventus they’re not aware of
17/04/2019, 22:05 - Paul;: And no one else is
17/04/2019, 22:08 - David;: I get that an arsenal fan doesn't like spurs but when they're playing City. It's like the way we were okay with the Soviet Union when they were fighting Hitler. You just let that lie for a while.
17/04/2019, 22:11 - Jack G;: City more likely to beat spurs in the league match now. Unlucky
17/04/2019, 22:12 - David;: Sassy
17/04/2019, 22:13 - Phill: History not an indicator of future performance Jack. You, of all people, as a west ham fan, should know this.
17/04/2019, 22:56 - Hamish Sinclair: To reopen our discussion  from a few months ago regarding the fa/league cup...

Would city winning fame cup and league cup only be considered a success?
17/04/2019, 22:59 - Rob;: City hierachy would probably be a little disappointed, but only in the context that they've spent the money for more.
17/04/2019, 22:59 - Rob;: It's not not a success
17/04/2019, 23:00 - David;: Yeah you can't say they've had a bad season
17/04/2019, 23:00 - Rob;: And it would just continue their feeling of dominance
17/04/2019, 23:01 - Rob;: No one really remembers when United's lesser seasons were, just that they were the dominant side for most of the 90s and early 2000s

18/04/2019, 10:08 - David;: Yeah, glorious
18/04/2019, 10:08 - David;: I want the sequences between Sterling's goal and the VAR decision played on loop at my funeral.

23/04/2019, 18:43 - David;: Former Liverpool striker Robbie Fowler says his lack of managerial experience "doesn't matter" after being appointed as the new boss of Brisbane Roar.

His only previous managerial experience came during a short spell with Thai side Muangthong United in 2011-12.

"Just because I'm not as experienced as some of them, doesn't mean I'm going to do as bad a job," he said.

"You could have Jurgen Klopp here, you could have Pep Guardiola, it doesn't necessarily mean they are going to be great managing Brisbane."

26/04/2019, 10:32 - David;: Heads straight for the Jewish Guild. Age 27. Makes 5 appearences. Then who should come knocking but Dunstable Town on a loan deal.
26/04/2019, 12:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Made 5 appearances for Bournemouth at the age of 37
26/04/2019, 12:03 - Rob;: 4 clubs in 1983
26/04/2019, 12:04 - David;: Yeah, with a total of 13 appearances between them
26/04/2019, 12:04 - David;: Had a little late rennaisance at San Jose earthquakes though. Pops in 21 goals in the 80-81 season
26/04/2019, 12:15 - Rob;: I wish they'd recorded a pints to goals ratio
26/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: Surely boozy centre backs would just dominate though
26/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: Your Tony Adams
26/04/2019, 12:28 - David;: His ratio would be obscene
26/04/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: I think pints would be considered like games, so a striker might have a 1 in 2 ratio - one goal for every two pints
26/04/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Tony Ten Pints' ratio would be correspondingly poor
26/04/2019, 13:47 - Damian Rumble: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6954283/Change-UK-group-plots-destroy-Lib-Dems.html
26/04/2019, 13:49 - Damian Rumble: I was cautiously optimistic about the TIG party but not anymore. They all resigned to fight Brexit but instead they have made it thier priority to fight the other anti Brexit party despite our offer to work together. I hope they all get spanked at the next general election...
26/04/2019, 13:49 - David;: I guess. But then light drinkers would clean up. You really need a pint-adjusted goals/game index. So for every 100 pints consumed, your goals are adjusted up by a weighting.
26/04/2019, 13:50 - David;: So e.g. Gazza's career comes out better than Pele's because of the pints he got in while doing it.
26/04/2019, 13:52 - Stefan;: Yeah and they've put up a slate of hilariously dreadful candidates, one whom has been endorsed by UKIP's leader
26/04/2019, 13:52 - Stefan;: Turns out you can be a remainer and still be a fucking racist
26/04/2019, 13:54 - David;: Yeah fucking hate TIG. Self-important pricks - there are already 2 committed remain UK parties (Green and Lib Dem) plus SNP and Plaid if that's your voting preference. They have just splintered it further and made Brexit party more likely to clean up.
26/04/2019, 13:55 - David;: Plus they are vacuous third way tossers
26/04/2019, 14:00 - David;: Wasnt there a thing with Adams where he stopped drinking and his form collapsed? Or stops being influential in the dressing room. So boozing actually key to his success.
26/04/2019, 14:05 - Damian Rumble: It's just so fucking petty. The main selling point is 'politics is broken, we are going to be a party of change' but they've essentially copied the policies of the other parties in this area and immediately descended into tribalism.
26/04/2019, 14:53 - Rob;: Adams did say the best game of his life was while pissed I tbink
26/04/2019, 14:54 - Rob;: Possibly Euro 96 semi

30/04/2019, 14:30 - Damian Rumble: I've gone full circle on chukka. When labour were in power I thought he was smug and stuck up prick. Under miliband I thought he was a whiny prick. Under Corbyn he actually came across as a fairly reasonable prick. Now in change UK he's reverted to a smug and stuck up prick.
30/04/2019, 14:31 - Jack G;: It’s all very petty
30/04/2019, 14:43 - Rob;: They've managed to completely conform to the sitting on the fence stereotype that dogs centrist politics with with a logo that looks like a fence and a name that's a compromise between two options
30/04/2019, 14:44 - David;: Both of which are themselves bland and non-commital

30/04/2019, 17:29 - Sam;: I want to see what the lord of light is about. Was he just wanting to help kill night king or more?
30/04/2019, 17:30 - Stefan;: There's a lot of fans who are butthurt about something called the prophecy of Azor Ahai, which has apparently been ruined now
30/04/2019, 17:33 - Jack G;: I’m hoping that GRRM is also cheesed off at everything and he’ll be motivated to actually finish the books now
30/04/2019, 17:35 - David;: Yeah Bran's whole story arc now pointless
30/04/2019, 17:36 - David;: It was a real dry hump of a resolution
30/04/2019, 17:36 - Rob;: It was a good episode and very well made, but the storyline pay-offs were pretty low
30/04/2019, 17:37 - Rob;: Although I am glad all those fucking years of watching Arya scrub the fucking floor as an assassin's apprentice paid off
30/04/2019, 17:37 - David;: It just felt arbitrary - no attempt to link it into all of the lore they have built up over 100s of hours of my life
30/04/2019, 17:38 - David;: Jon snow pointless. Dragons pointless.
30/04/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: Perhaps we will see in flashback what Bran was doing, beyond flapping about as a raven, while the war waged
30/04/2019, 17:39 - Jack G;: The writing/directing definitely has a marked drop in quality since they’ve gone beyond the material of the existing books.
30/04/2019, 17:40 - David;: How did Arya even know where he was? And how did she fight out of a castle over-run with 1000s of reanimated corpses in a few minutes?
30/04/2019, 17:41 - David;: On her own
30/04/2019, 17:42 - Rob;: She knew he was going for Bran and where Bran was. I got the impression that she had jumped from a rooftop nearby the room we last saw her in
30/04/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: Hence why the red woman was in there
30/04/2019, 17:43 - David;: But everyone else knew he was there
30/04/2019, 17:43 - David;: No reason to try and go there? Only she thought of it
30/04/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: The red woman told her to
30/04/2019, 17:44 - David;: Was he that close to the castle that you can just jump there from the roof?!
30/04/2019, 17:44 - David;: Definitely never established that and if so everyone would see that ages ago
30/04/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: She must have jumped from a height to get that height
30/04/2019, 17:45 - David;: So he was just hanging out at the base of the castle - no one from either side realised?
30/04/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: Yeah, that was the plan they agreed in the last episode. Use bran as bait out in the open in the small wood next to the castle
30/04/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: Lure the night king
30/04/2019, 17:50 - Sam;: He was craters for bran
30/04/2019, 17:52 - Stefan;: This is how they filmed it https://twitter.com/YahTimest/status/1123100417754324992?s=08
30/04/2019, 17:57 - David;: Also  for the battlb7e?
30/04/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: What does Bran do now? He's a freak with only one purpose in the world and it's been achieved
30/04/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: He's immediately post referendum Farage
30/04/2019, 17:58 - Rob;: Perhaps Remainers will bring the white walkers back
30/04/2019, 18:01 - David;: So that was the whole basis of the battle plan. But relies on the red lady whispering it to Arya Stark on the off chance?
30/04/2019, 18:01 - David;: Great fucking communication strategy
30/04/2019, 18:01 - David;: And no one else was told where he would be
30/04/2019, 18:08 - Sam;: Everyone was told where he would be in the planning meeting.
30/04/2019, 18:08 - Sam;: Arya was there
30/04/2019, 18:09 - Sam;: End of last episode
30/04/2019, 18:09 - Sam;: Eppy 2
30/04/2019, 18:10 - David;: But none of the key players were making any attempt to get there. Jon faffing about in the castle
30/04/2019, 18:10 - David;: Lannister et al otherwise engaged
30/04/2019, 18:11 - Sam;: Jon was pinned down by the dragon, other players pinned down by undead soldiers.
30/04/2019, 19:17 - Paul;: Is the fat one dead yet?
30/04/2019, 19:18 - David;: Nah survived
30/04/2019, 19:42 - / James Ball: Never watched
30/04/2019, 19:50 - David;: Anyone seen this asmr thing?
30/04/2019, 19:51 - / James Ball: Multiple thousands of videos of it
30/04/2019, 19:51 - / James Ball: Well, that exist. I havent watched multiple thousands
30/04/2019, 19:52 - David;: Yeah it's huge
30/04/2019, 19:53 - Rob;: I Googled and an article suggested I might orgasm to the noise of a man eating KFC
30/04/2019, 19:53 - Rob;: Is that what you meant?
30/04/2019, 19:53 - Hamish Sinclair: No thankyou
30/04/2019, 19:53 - David;: Haven't seen that particular video
30/04/2019, 19:54 - Damian Rumble: There's another three episodes right? Not sure they are how they are going to fill them. Surely Dany goes kings landing but then realised she only has an army of 12 major characters who were somehow able to survive people the battle. Gets fucked by cersi. Game over.
30/04/2019, 19:55 - / James Ball: I watched a couple of some Scottish girl doing it
30/04/2019, 19:55 - / James Ball: I get the idea of it
30/04/2019, 19:55 - / James Ball: But no orgasms - yet
30/04/2019, 19:56 - David;: Nah it's more spine tingles Sort of works. There was one guy doing some very intense ones
30/04/2019, 19:57 - / James Ball: Yeah it's taps into some kind of deep rooted catatonic thing I think
30/04/2019, 19:57 - / James Ball: Like massaging a chicken to make it all asleep
30/04/2019, 19:58 - David;: https://youtu.be/Ch_i9jxLhXs
30/04/2019, 19:58 - David;: Where he uses the toothbrush direct on the mic
30/04/2019, 19:58 - David;: Very close
30/04/2019, 20:02 - Paul;: Lol such bullshit
30/04/2019, 20:03 - David;: But the buzz mate
30/04/2019, 20:04 - / James Ball: I've never got a chill from it but it does have an effect if you're in the mood to allow it
30/04/2019, 20:04 - Sam;: Like a decent blozza
30/04/2019, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: https://twitter.com/JOE_co_uk/status/1122945238727786498?s=08
30/04/2019, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: This really tickled me
30/04/2019, 21:06 - David;: Lol
30/04/2019, 21:06 - David;: Winterfell United held firm under immense pressure for what felt like the full 90 minutes before Stark struck late to put them through to the final, where they will face Cersei Lannister's dangerous King's Landing side.
30/04/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: That really is excellent
30/04/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: There is nothing that can't be viewed through the prism of football
30/04/2019, 21:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Unused subsitute: Tyrion lanister
30/04/2019, 21:28 - David;: Called up due to an injury crisis, the academy prospect appeared to be hopelessly out of her depth but did well to halt a midfield surge from zombie Wun Wun just when he looked like he might break through the Winterfell backline. Regardless, it was a poor decision from the manager to rush her into the starting lineup as she struggled to cope with the immense physicality of the league
01/05/2019, 08:02 - Damian Rumble: Zombie Wun Wun - 

Put in some heavy challenges and looked set to be the man to break the deadlock before losing an embarrassing 50/50 to the much smaller Lyanna Mormont that, just like Paul Pogba's dismal aerial duel with Raheem Sterling during last week's Manchester Derby, has since been ridiculed by the tabloids, who are now also attacking his body language and most recent haircuts.
01/05/2019, 08:02 - Damian Rumble: Great
01/05/2019, 13:48 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/05/2019, 17:54 - Jack G;: Odds on Suarez to bite Van Dijk tonight?
01/05/2019, 20:12 - Sam;: Luis Suarez is so hateable
01/05/2019, 20:12 - Sam;: Just seeing him on a pitch
01/05/2019, 20:12 - David;: Good to be able to hate him now
01/05/2019, 20:13 - Sam;: His ratty little bite face
01/05/2019, 20:14 - David;: Yeah, it's one thing to bite. But to gnaw down like a rodent
01/05/2019, 20:15 - David;: And then pretend the real injustice is that his arm has hurt your teeth
01/05/2019, 20:16 - Sam;: And top of that,be a terrible cunt. Irredeemable. Only Uruguayans could like him
01/05/2019, 20:17 - David;: Massive penno earlier, why didn't ref even go to VAR?
01/05/2019, 20:17 - David;: Pointless
01/05/2019, 20:18 - Sam;: Not enough really. Ridiculous first 15 though. Breathless.
01/05/2019, 20:18 - Sam;: Can’t keep it up for 90 surely
01/05/2019, 20:18 - David;: Anywhere else on the pitch of you go through someone from behind it's a free kick
01/05/2019, 20:19 - Sam;: Yeah, age old thing though, has to be more to be a pen
01/05/2019, 20:19 - Sam;: Classic example there
01/05/2019, 20:19 - Sam;: Mane getting the free kick
01/05/2019, 20:20 - Sam;: Wouldn’t have got a pen for that
01/05/2019, 20:22 - David;: But why have VAR if you don't even check it?
01/05/2019, 20:22 - David;: It just makes it arbitrary
01/05/2019, 20:25 - Sam;: The theory is that VAR is for clear cut issues or errors, not for everything
01/05/2019, 20:28 - Sam;: One away goal is all that’s needed
01/05/2019, 20:40 - Sam;: What happened to keita? I missed that
01/05/2019, 20:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Groin
01/05/2019, 20:41 - Phill: Was fucking Barca too hard in the butthole and he bust his dick
01/05/2019, 20:41 - Sam;: His grogodoins?
01/05/2019, 21:37 - Sam;: Again. One away goal changes everything
01/05/2019, 21:38 - Phill: So lucky
01/05/2019, 21:44 - David;: Hate the way everyone will rave about Messi now. Pure luck for that goal and has been quiet all game. But will be all about him.
01/05/2019, 21:44 - Jack G;: Wtf
01/05/2019, 21:44 - David;: Ah. Well
01/05/2019, 21:44 - David;: Lol
01/05/2019, 21:44 - Jack G;: Nice timing
01/05/2019, 21:45 - David;: Phil bet
01/05/2019, 21:46 - Jack G;: How did Salah miss that?
01/05/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Yet still . Salad fucks its
01/05/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Wotsits
01/05/2019, 21:47 - Damian Rumble: Lol
01/05/2019, 21:48 - Jack G;: Suarez such a cunt
01/05/2019, 21:49 - David;: Put away the moon
01/05/2019, 21:50 - Damian Rumble: Messi. Accidentally puts it in when the ball bounces back in his face. Salah. can't put it in when shooting at an empty goal.
01/05/2019, 21:50 - Jack G;: Apples and oranges
01/05/2019, 21:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Very fine margins
01/05/2019, 22:08 - Damian Rumble: Anyone else planning on supporting Ajax against Barcelona in the final?
01/05/2019, 22:08 - Hamish Sinclair: >not supporting the underdogs
01/05/2019, 22:10 - Sam;: Butelona
02/05/2019, 09:30 - Phill: >tfw Gavin Williamson swears on his kids lives
02/05/2019, 09:30 - Phill: >Tfw they die

02/05/2019, 09:33 - Stefan;: He's trotted out the old "kangaroo court" line as well
02/05/2019, 09:37 - David;: The kangaroo lawyers must be furious. Only thing their legal system is know for is corruption
02/05/2019, 09:38 - David;: Sure there are p
02/05/2019, 09:38 - Stefan;: Yeah it's an outrageous smear on them
02/05/2019, 09:38 - David;: *plenty of decent kangaroo magistrates out there
02/05/2019, 09:38 - Rob;: Hopping mad they are

03/05/2019, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Need a picture of him drinking out of it
03/05/2019, 08:17 - Damian Rumble: What's that for?
03/05/2019, 08:19 - Hamish Sinclair: It's in the plaque damo
03/05/2019, 08:25 - Damian Rumble: Ah... Didn't click on the old photo there did I...
03/05/2019, 08:25 - Damian Rumble: Secondary question.. what is walking football???
03/05/2019, 08:26 - Rob;: Old man football, more or less how it sounds
03/05/2019, 08:27 - Hamish Sinclair: It's what we will all be doing in 40 years
03/05/2019, 08:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Walking frisbee
03/05/2019, 09:01 - Paul;: Essentially he’s won the FA cup
03/05/2019, 09:02 - David;: You'd take that
03/05/2019, 09:03 - David;: Does this qualify him for European glory next season?
03/05/2019, 09:04 - Paul;: European glory being versus Gloucestershire or something
03/05/2019, 09:05 - David;: Yeah are there any higher level tournies he can get into?
03/05/2019, 09:13 - Rob;: What position does Derek play?
03/05/2019, 09:19 - Damian Rumble: I feel like he's got the build of a centre back
03/05/2019, 09:19 - Paul;: I believe everyone ambles everywhere. They’ve brought back total football
03/05/2019, 09:19 - Paul;: 80’s Dutch playing style
03/05/2019, 09:20 - Damian Rumble: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2787824/

Basically this...
03/05/2019, 09:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Virgil van derek
03/05/2019, 09:34 - Paul;: Tricky van dicky
03/05/2019, 14:01 - David;: Will Emery rotate everyone on Sunday Rob?
03/05/2019, 14:02 - David;: Will the players in the first XI even have legs?
03/05/2019, 14:14 - Rob;: Probably. I wouldn't be investing
03/05/2019, 16:43 - David;: <Media omitted>
03/05/2019, 16:46 - / James Ball: good stats
03/05/2019, 16:46 - / James Ball: a mate of mine was just elected as a green councillor for south oxfordshire - he's not called Alan Graves so the stat checks out so far
03/05/2019, 16:50 - Stefan;: Greens won 5 seats in South Oxfordshire and 12 in Mid Suffolk - biggest opposition party there now
03/05/2019, 16:51 - / James Ball: yes indeed, he's very happy and a little overwhelmed
03/05/2019, 16:52 - / James Ball: my ward is labour and two independents now
03/05/2019, 17:34 - Damian Rumble: That will soon disappear when the reality of surrendering all for evening and weekends to petty arguments about bins and the glacial progress of decision making really kicks in
03/05/2019, 17:38 - / James Ball: he's 42, been involved in local politics for several years
03/05/2019, 17:39 - / James Ball: for someone advocating democratic process you're also very damning of it Damo
03/05/2019, 17:40 - Jack G;: FPTP is a piece of shit to be fair
03/05/2019, 17:46 - Jack G;: Really happy to see the greens do so well though
03/05/2019, 17:48 - Paul;: All independents got fucked in chippy. Were the best ones. The sheeple all just voted labour
03/05/2019, 17:56 - David;: What did the independents want?
03/05/2019, 17:57 - Paul;: You’ve got your Dom Harrison’s. a chippy favourite. Just appreciates the place been here for generations
03/05/2019, 17:57 - Paul;: Sambo knows him
03/05/2019, 17:58 - Rob;: Dom who used to work in the Blue?
03/05/2019, 18:00 - Paul;: Nah don’t think so
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Rob;: Shame. I'd have voted for Dom's policy of filling up a shelf with pints just before last orders and distributing them after
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
03/05/2019, 18:02 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
03/05/2019, 18:03 - Rob;: Yeah that's him
03/05/2019, 18:07 - Paul;: Lost out by 50 votes. Corruption to the heart of small government
03/05/2019, 18:09 - Stefan;: Lol, that's definitely illegal. Remember learning in the parliamentary reform unit about how 18th century elections were drunken riots where candidates handed out free booze for votes
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: It wasn't for votes then
03/05/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: We paid for the pints
03/05/2019, 18:15 - Stefan;: Fair enough
03/05/2019, 18:15 - Stefan;: He missed an opportunity though
04/05/2019, 08:45 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/05/2019, 13:35 - Sam;: Lol spurs
04/05/2019, 13:35 - Sam;: Two straight reds
04/05/2019, 13:36 - Jack G;: Every team except City and Liverpool appear to have gone to shit
04/05/2019, 13:36 - Rob;: Spurs gonna Spurs
04/05/2019, 13:37 - Rob;: 3 mins on the pitch for Forth then
04/05/2019, 13:37 - Sam;: They made two half time subs to take off two players on a booking. Then one of the subs gets a straight red
04/05/2019, 13:37 - Rob;: Brought on to avoid a second booking
04/05/2019, 14:20 - Jack G;: Finally
05/05/2019, 12:06 - David;: So it's essentially still Saturday
05/05/2019, 13:40 - David;: Derek must be loving that West Brom goal Paul?
05/05/2019, 15:31 - David;: >United

05/05/2019, 16:03 - Paul;: Sambo. Thoughts?
05/05/2019, 16:04 - Paul;: In fact I need help on how to remove an old toilet so caked in shit I can no longer see porcelain
05/05/2019, 16:21 - Sam;: We’re in the position PEADOPOOL we’re in when sloppy kloppy took over and when poch took over at spurs.
05/05/2019, 16:21 - Sam;: Wenger out
05/05/2019, 16:24 - Phill: >sloppy kloppy
05/05/2019, 16:25 - David;: Will Pogba stick around without the champo
05/05/2019, 16:26 - Sam;: All bets are off
05/05/2019, 16:26 - David;: Who would you keep from current squad?
05/05/2019, 16:29 - Paul;: The kit man?
05/05/2019, 16:29 - David;: Hib
05/05/2019, 16:31 - Sam;: Anyone young but not Young
05/05/2019, 16:33 - Phill: Even De Gea is affected by the United shitening factor
05/05/2019, 16:35 - David;: Jones and Smalling. Get rid
05/05/2019, 16:35 - David;: Can't build a team around gurns
05/05/2019, 16:35 - Paul;: Is there even a star player
05/05/2019, 16:36 - Paul;: A talisman
05/05/2019, 16:36 - David;: Such a specific skill with no evident football relevance
05/05/2019, 16:41 - Phill: It means United have now gone five games without a win, their worst sequence since they went eight games without a victory under Louis van Gaal between November and December 2015.
05/05/2019, 16:42 - Phill: Lol. Pure shite.
05/05/2019, 22:59 - David;: Chelsea's next kit is quite rank
06/05/2019, 07:58 - Phill: If arsenal and Chelsea get yuropa final and Chelsea win, do arsenal get the CL spot?
06/05/2019, 08:14 - Jack G;: Nope only get it if they win the trophy
06/05/2019, 08:14 - Phill: Who get the spare spot?
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Phill: Some Eastern European team who finished 3rd in the Chechnyan league or something ?
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Jack G;: Probably an extra team in qualifying rounds somewhere
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Jack G;: Most probably
06/05/2019, 08:15 - Phill: Harsh.
06/05/2019, 08:18 - Jack G;: Adds extra spice to the final though
07/05/2019, 09:17 - Damian Rumble: Thus article perfectly sums up my feelings about the most recent GoTs...

07/05/2019, 17:58 - Paul;: Mourinho looks like a genius now
07/05/2019, 18:09 - Jack G;: “What’s the best you can hope for next season Gary?”

“To have 11 players on the pitch that want to play football”
07/05/2019, 19:54 - David;: Lol the way they're trying to market Carling as an artisanal craft beer now. No marketing campaign in the world can polish that particular turd
07/05/2019, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: That ad was very Brexit-y
07/05/2019, 21:16 - Damian Rumble: Honk?
07/05/2019, 21:16 - Jack G;: That’s a honk
07/05/2019, 21:17 - Rob;: There's been a honk up there
07/05/2019, 21:17 - David;: Holy shit
07/05/2019, 21:19 - Rob;: David I am imagining you on the floor ala that Everton game we watched in the pub on the Greyhound road
07/05/2019, 21:20 - David;: I'm beyond that
07/05/2019, 21:20 - David;: What is life?
07/05/2019, 21:20 - Rob;: Is your world dissolving like Maximus's at the end of Gladiator?
07/05/2019, 21:20 - David;: The cats were terrified when the 3rd goal went in. Bolted from the room
07/05/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: After they said Allison was worth he weight in gold, I looked up how much that might actually be
07/05/2019, 21:33 - Rob;: Only worth £2.87 million in gold
07/05/2019, 21:33 - Rob;: Much less than Liverpool paid
07/05/2019, 21:33 - Rob;: Very few players not worth their weight in gold these days
07/05/2019, 21:34 - Hamish Sinclair: 👍
07/05/2019, 21:56 - Damian Rumble: That was a hell of a match...
07/05/2019, 21:56 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
07/05/2019, 21:57 - Jack G;: >tfw you blow a 3-0 lead
07/05/2019, 21:59 - David;: I'm gone.

07/05/2019, 22:14 - Phill: Smells of tapas
08/05/2019, 15:55 - Paul;: Sam how does it feel to support Man U in this new era?
08/05/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: > Theresa May comparing herself to Liverpool
08/05/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/Peston/status/1126081772981190656?s=19
08/05/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: Overlooking the fact that their success overturned a seemingly decisive first result
08/05/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: And that ultimately it's kept them _in_ Europe
08/05/2019, 20:03 - Jack G;: Can’t believe Vertonghen is playing so soon after that pretty bad concussion injury last week
08/05/2019, 20:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, the rule is 1 week
08/05/2019, 20:06 - Jack G;: Really dangerous risking another blow to the head so soon, I’d want to take more time to recover for sure
08/05/2019, 20:26 - David;: Seems very cautious - aren't you basically over concussion in a couple of days?
08/05/2019, 20:29 - Phill: Said every coach ever until players started becoming disabled.
08/05/2019, 20:31 - Jack G;: Especially for a CB who’s going to be heading the ball all night
08/05/2019, 20:31 - David;: That's like rugby forwards etc. Bit of light concussion now and then probably fine.
08/05/2019, 20:32 - Phill: Little bit of stroke. Fine mate.
08/05/2019, 20:33 - Phill: Spurs are dog shit
08/05/2019, 20:34 - Jack G;: Taught at the school of large Samuel
08/05/2019, 20:36 - David;: A bonce in hand is worth two on the bench
08/05/2019, 20:37 - David;: Dr Sinclair what actually is concussion?
08/05/2019, 20:40 - David;: >Trippier. Play to the whistle.
08/05/2019, 20:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Mild head trauma
08/05/2019, 20:43 - David;: Bit is it a nervous thing or blood?
08/05/2019, 20:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Diagnosis is normally based on quite vague/subtle cognitive changes though
08/05/2019, 20:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Predomiently nervous
08/05/2019, 20:44 - Hamish Sinclair: But sometimes you can see some minor bleeding/bruising on imageing
08/05/2019, 20:44 - David;: Ah. Bleeding in the brain
08/05/2019, 20:44 - Hamish Sinclair: But unlike something like a stroke, it affects the brain globally rather than a specific area
08/05/2019, 20:45 - David;: When they were wheeling out the Karius diagnosis like 3 weeks later would that have been based on imaging?
08/05/2019, 20:45 - Hamish Sinclair: No
08/05/2019, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Cognitive assesment
08/05/2019, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Its so vague though, and quite subjective
08/05/2019, 20:46 - David;: Especially retrospectively - so was he recalling how he felt?
08/05/2019, 20:46 - Phill: When did BOOOOZAN Tadic become good?
08/05/2019, 20:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Things like, loss of concentration, low mood score, and both of those things could be associated with fucking up a European cup final
08/05/2019, 20:48 - Phill: Lol low mood
08/05/2019, 20:48 - Phill: Playing in a CL final. In a bad mood about it.
08/05/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, alot of the symptoms of concussion  would be similar to those shown after a career ending performance
08/05/2019, 20:49 - Phill: "it was revealed by Klopps backroom medical team that Karius suffered a bout of low mood during the game"
08/05/2019, 20:49 - David;: 'did you feel shit when you threw that ball straight onto the defenders foot and it bounced into the net in a CL final letting down all your teams mates'? Must be concussed
08/05/2019, 20:50 - David;: Lol
08/05/2019, 20:50 - David;: Apparently he's rebuilding at Besiktas
08/05/2019, 20:51 - David;: There's YouTube highlights clips to prove it
08/05/2019, 20:51 - Hamish Sinclair: I thought he was still shit?
08/05/2019, 20:51 - Phill: Think in the Turkish league you can be shit and get away with it
08/05/2019, 20:53 - Jack G;: You can make any keeper look like Neuer in a highlights video
08/05/2019, 20:57 - Paul;: Shittenham
08/05/2019, 20:57 - Jack G;: 👍
08/05/2019, 21:20 - David;: Football

08/05/2019, 21:30 - David;: Mass sharting
08/05/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Lol Ajax have had it in their hands.
08/05/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Hands full of slurry.
08/05/2019, 21:49 - Jack G;: Vertonghen too concussed to score that open goal there
08/05/2019, 21:57 - David;: Fuck off
08/05/2019, 21:57 - David;: Football is over
08/05/2019, 21:58 - Jack G;: Fuck sake
08/05/2019, 21:58 - David;: This game

08/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: What score?
08/05/2019, 22:00 - David;: Football is over Rob
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Phill: 3-2 spurs
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Phill: Moura hattrick
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: Nah
08/05/2019, 22:00 - Phill: Last kick of game
08/05/2019, 22:00 - David;: 95 minutes
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Phill: Spurs 2-0 down at half time
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Phill: 3-0 on aggregate
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Jack G;: Anyone got a spare Liverpool shirt I can wear for the final?
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Paul;: Here comes the troll to defeat Liverpool
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Damian Rumble: Lol
08/05/2019, 22:01 - Rob;: So the final is like a choice of which parent you have to fuck?
08/05/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: Do not want
08/05/2019, 22:02 - Jack G;: Is Salah back for the final?
08/05/2019, 22:02 - Phill: Yeah yeah
08/05/2019, 22:03 - Jack G;: Sweet
08/05/2019, 22:03 - Paul;: Means Liverpool win was shit. This better comeback
08/05/2019, 22:03 - David;: Firmino doubtful
08/05/2019, 22:03 - Jack G;: Origi is god anyway doesn’t matter
08/05/2019, 22:04 - Rob;: I never signed up4 this
08/05/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: Not in my name
08/05/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: I guess I am supporting Liverpool then.
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Phill: I'd 8-2 be an arsenal fan in this situation.
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Paul;: Lol rob how is the butthurt? Is this new levels of hurt?
08/05/2019, 22:06 - Jack G;: So chances are all 4 European finalist will be English this year?
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Paul;: Do you blame Gibbs now?
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Damian Rumble: What are the odds pre semi's?
08/05/2019, 22:07 - David;: There a lot if troll potential
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Phill: 👍
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Jack G;: The only real choice
08/05/2019, 22:07 - Rob;: I think I'll just come around to wanting Liverpool to win
08/05/2019, 22:08 - Rob;: For thehe greater good
08/05/2019, 22:08 - Phill: Might support spurs just for the trolling of arsenal. We've got 5.
08/05/2019, 22:08 - Jack G;: How about Ox smashes in a winner Rob?
08/05/2019, 22:10 - Rob;: Ah you'd be happy for the boy
08/05/2019, 22:11 - David;: Like everyone avoiding the elephant in the room that the 3rd goal clearly came off de ligt
08/05/2019, 22:11 - David;: Best no one ever mentions that
08/05/2019, 22:14 - Damian Rumble: 1st June going to be HUGE
08/05/2019, 22:22 - Paul;: Statue for Moura
08/05/2019, 22:24 - Damian Rumble: Soo... Man city wining the league. Liverpool spurs in the champion league final. Chelsea and arsenal potentially in the Europa League final. This means it is only United that have massively under achieved this year then...
08/05/2019, 22:28 - David;: Statue for Divock
08/05/2019, 22:28 - David;: The BT advert is so grindingly oppressive
08/05/2019, 22:29 - David;: A sense of impending doom and my mind juddering to a halt
08/05/2019, 22:29 - David;: *advert music
08/05/2019, 22:29 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
08/05/2019, 22:29 - Paul;: How much does this aggravate
08/05/2019, 22:39 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
08/05/2019, 22:41 - Paul;: I’m doing a spursy
08/05/2019, 22:42 - David;: 👍
08/05/2019, 22:51 - Damian Rumble: You know I'm very tempted to become a spurs fan. A side from the huge potential for trolling I do actually live in North London and there's huge milage as far as smugness is concerned when it comes to wining the champions League over Liverpool.
08/05/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: You live opposite the Emirates, Damo
08/05/2019, 22:56 - Rob;: A glory supporting spurs fan lol
08/05/2019, 22:57 - Paul;: Lol damo
08/05/2019, 22:57 - David;: >a side from huge potential
08/05/2019, 22:58 - David;: 7
08/05/2019, 23:03 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/05/2019, 23:04 - Stefan;: Nice, where's that?
08/05/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: Alley Pally
08/05/2019, 23:05 - Rob;: He's invested heavily in lighting since we saw him in Bristol
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Rob;: *Brixton
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Damian Rumble: Yeah that would have made a huge difference
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Damian Rumble: Can't believe I missed that show... Didn't even realise he was playing....
08/05/2019, 23:07 - Stefan;: That looks amazing
08/05/2019, 23:08 - Rob;: There are 3 nights in a row I think, might not be sold out
08/05/2019, 23:08 - David;: Needs a good sound system. Saw him at field day and didn't do it justice
08/05/2019, 23:09 - Rob;: This was pretty good, especially for Alexandra Palace
08/05/2019, 23:09 - David;: Yeah bonobo there was decent
08/05/2019, 23:09 - Rob;: I feel like he suffers from his only 'I'm only a DJ' insecurities. Could be fucking massive if he played his own stuff plus his remixes and made a show out of it
08/05/2019, 23:11 - David;: Isn't that basically what he does?
08/05/2019, 23:11 - David;: Planet there
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: But every time I've seen him he's just hidden away somewhere, and until now without a light show
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: Tonight was his album mixed with some new stuff
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: But none of the remix bangers
08/05/2019, 23:11 - David;: Oh yeah I see. Yeah was a bit like that at field day
08/05/2019, 23:11 - Rob;: No Eric Prydz, no Jamie Xx
08/05/2019, 23:13 - David;: I think it's a problem for people who get huge completely off the back of sample manipulation and production. How do you make that a live spectacle
08/05/2019, 23:13 - Rob;: Yeah
08/05/2019, 23:14 - Rob;: It's a legit way to make new sounds, but a bit of a cop out to press play and expect people to go wild
08/05/2019, 23:14 - Rob;: Chemical Brothers do it very well
08/05/2019, 23:14 - Rob;: If you build a good light show and danceable tunes, they will come
08/05/2019, 23:15 - David;: Caribou live is good
08/05/2019, 23:15 - Rob;: And Mr Norman Slim
08/05/2019, 23:16 - Rob;: Caribou when Sun comes on and u r blinded and fucked 👌🏻👌🏻
08/05/2019, 23:18 - David;: Yeah yeah
08/05/2019, 23:35 - Hamish Sinclair: That looks fucking great
08/05/2019, 23:51 - David;: So this season in Europe we've beaten the champions of Spain, the champions of Germany, the champions of France and the runners up of Italy
08/05/2019, 23:52 - David;: (and lost to the champions of Serbia)
09/05/2019, 10:38 - Phill: Lol >Danny Baker
09/05/2019, 11:47 - / James Ball: The little chimp baby
09/05/2019, 11:48 - / James Ball: Had no idea of racist link apparently
09/05/2019, 11:49 - David;: Always been a weird little bloke though
09/05/2019, 11:53 - David;: Enjoying the Mail's worldview falling apart as they try to make sense of their line on it. 'But royals good. But political correctness bad. But racism good'.
09/05/2019, 12:59 - Rob;: You can't plead ignorance as a comedian/journalist
09/05/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: The Hennessey defence
09/05/2019, 13:06 - Stefan;: Classic old white guy
09/05/2019, 13:07 - Stefan;: "I wasn't deliberately comparing the mixed race baby to a chimpanzee, I'm just so crashingly ignorant that I didn't know about this widespread stereotype"
09/05/2019, 14:06 - Rob;: The person I sit next to at work hasn't been able to come into work today because Spurs are in the Champions League final
09/05/2019, 14:07 - Jack G;: Arsenal fan? Or hungover Spurs fan?
09/05/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: Spurs season ticket holder
09/05/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: Just sent a message to our boss saying she couldn't make it because of the game. Fully accepted
09/05/2019, 14:09 - David;: Ha, brilliant
09/05/2019, 14:09 - David;: Due to hangover or just still honking too much to work?
09/05/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: I've got no more info than that
09/05/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: I imagine hungover
09/05/2019, 14:10 - Paul;: Too much honking
09/05/2019, 14:10 - David;: Would be good if he just needs a day to savour it. Completely sober.
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Jack G;: Any of you Liverpool fans thinking of going to Madrid for the final?
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: No chances of ticket
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Flights over a grand
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: No
09/05/2019, 14:12 - Jack G;: Ah
09/05/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: Grand for a flight, piss take
09/05/2019, 14:14 - David;: Nah, just froust in Chippy probably
09/05/2019, 14:15 - Rob;: I'm at a wedding. Second final in a row
09/05/2019, 14:52 - Paul;: Just drive it
09/05/2019, 15:03 - David;: Cycle
09/05/2019, 15:05 - Jack G;: That would be great, could have some lovely stops in south France
09/05/2019, 15:06 - David;: Pyrenees would be an issue
09/05/2019, 15:06 - Jack G;: Just cycle it mate, np
09/05/2019, 15:20 - David;: Jack Froome
09/05/2019, 17:29 - Jack G;: Just watched the latest GoT episode. How the hell did no one see Euron and his fleet coming? It was broad daylight, they had scout ships and the dragons flying above...
09/05/2019, 17:36 - Damian Rumble: I know... Ridiculous
09/05/2019, 17:36 - David;: Yeah was shit
09/05/2019, 17:36 - David;: They've fucked it
09/05/2019, 17:37 - Damian Rumble: Also... Scorpion balista <> early 18th century cannon
09/05/2019, 17:50 - Jack G;: If Tywin was still alive he’d wipe the floor with all of these jokers
09/05/2019, 17:52 - Stefan;: Yeah that was a massive tactical blunder
09/05/2019, 17:52 - Stefan;: Why isn't everyone calling for Danaerys's resignation and a full public inquiry?
09/05/2019, 18:02 - Paul;: Top story is Danny Baker on 6pm news lol
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Paul;: “A mistake”
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: Never heard of him until today
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: Who’s Raul Moat?
09/05/2019, 18:03 - Paul;: Tbh I’d never heard of him either I don’t think
09/05/2019, 18:07 - David;: Does the morning shit footbal chat on Saturdays before the actual games start. Odd fella
09/05/2019, 18:07 - David;: Lots of quirky shit that only makes sense if you born before 1960
09/05/2019, 18:24 - Damian Rumble: They tried and failed and now they can't try again until a full year has passed
09/05/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: He wrote a great sit com a while a go
09/05/2019, 20:03 - Jack G;: So if Arsenal get to the final in Baku, can Mkhitaryan okay? Very strong anti Armenian sentiment in Azerbaijan
09/05/2019, 20:03 - Jack G;: Play*
09/05/2019, 20:08 - Rob;: He didn't play when we were away at Quarabag for that reason, so perhaps not
09/05/2019, 20:09 - Rob;: That wouldn't worry me hugely tbh unless we had a number of midfield injuries
09/05/2019, 20:11 - Rob;: Perhaps it won't be an issue after that goal
09/05/2019, 20:17 - Jack G;: A banger
09/05/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Can you fuck off with GoT chat.
09/05/2019, 20:27 - Phill: No spoilers.

12/05/2019, 17:06 - Jack G;: Also a three way tie for golden boot
12/05/2019, 17:06 - Jack G;: Mane, Salah, Aubameyang
12/05/2019, 17:07 - Hamish Sinclair: What happens now? Does it go to assists?
12/05/2019, 17:07 - Jack G;: Not sure. If it was a two way tie they could have one boot each but three it’s up in the air
12/05/2019, 17:25 - David;: Surely should be based on games played?
12/05/2019, 17:27 - Jack G;: I don’t think they’ve had a tie before so they’ve never come up with rules. Pretty sure they’re all just sharing it
12/05/2019, 17:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Pretty sure the world cup one takes assists into account
12/05/2019, 18:10 - David;: Managed to beat my record FF points tally, surpassing the famous 12/13 team. So the day's not a total write off.
12/05/2019, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: 🥳
12/05/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: They said on 5 live the boot is shared
12/05/2019, 18:22 - Rob;: I believe Salah gets weekends
12/05/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: Spurs' ILLEGAL offside goal against us earlier in the season cost us a top four place in the end
12/05/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: I can see no other factors at play
12/05/2019, 18:27 - David;: What's the treble you're going to win this year?
12/05/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: That will be hard to work out
12/05/2019, 18:28 - David;: Finishing above spurs was one of the titles in the treble I believe
12/05/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Europa League would be the bedrock were that to happen
12/05/2019, 18:29 - David;: Yeah. What other straws can be clutched?
12/05/2019, 18:29 - David;: Finishing above United. Title 2
12/05/2019, 18:30 - David;: Qualifying for champions league of you win europa as well. That's three
12/05/2019, 18:30 - David;: Or winning more trophies than spurs if they lose the final.
12/05/2019, 18:34 - David;: Aubameyang getting 1/3rd of the golden boot. Could get some shitty mileage out of that surely
12/05/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: It's not a bumper year
12/05/2019, 18:54 - David;: Do you think Emery should stay?
12/05/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Yeah, and probably regardless of what happens in the Europa League final. It was always going to be different following Wenger, and taking on a squad that was so uncompetitive last season. He's done just enough to given the time to build a team he wants next summer
12/05/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Will be judged more harshly next season
12/05/2019, 18:57 - David;: Yeah I suppose not really his signings yet.
12/05/2019, 18:58 - David;: Worrying that you seemed to get worse not better though.
12/05/2019, 18:58 - David;: He should have swapped the second and 1st half of the season
12/05/2019, 19:00 - Jack G;: Need to bring in a big CB and CM. Your Van Dijk, your Kanté
12/05/2019, 19:01 - David;: CM fine with torreira, xhaka, Guendouzi surely? Think you need decent wide forwards and better defenders
12/05/2019, 19:02 - David;: Also replace Ozil because he brings too much butt hurt
12/05/2019, 19:02 - Jack G;: Hmm not sure. A lot of the mid table teams have very athletic midfields that they’ve struggled to deal with
12/05/2019, 19:03 - David;: Iwobi not a top 4 player

12/05/2019, 19:05 - Phill: >Old Toilet
12/05/2019, 19:05 - Rob;: Need a Ramsay replacement and Ozil improvement. Wide forward. Top class CB and back-up right back
12/05/2019, 19:07 - Rob;: Iwobi improved vastly this season. Physically imposing with a good work rate. I'd like to see him stay, but become more of a squad player
12/05/2019, 23:15 - David;: Such a shit goal of the season
12/05/2019, 23:16 - David;: Only 6
12/05/2019, 23:16 - David;: Should obviously be every goal of the month

21/05/2019, 09:31 - Jack G;: Yeah
21/05/2019, 09:40 - Rob;: Yeah
21/05/2019, 09:40 - Rob;: Fucken dun with it
21/05/2019, 09:51 - David;: Thought it was an okay last epi considering how they've already fucked everything up
21/05/2019, 09:51 - David;: Did as much as they could really
21/05/2019, 09:55 - Rob;: I think the outcomes on paper are fine, just feel they got to them in a very cack-handed way. That huge cut to a meeting of people you'd forgotten existed
21/05/2019, 09:55 - Rob;: It looked great though. The imagery in the first half was excellent
21/05/2019, 09:56 - Paul;: Won’t be watching the last season. Not going to ruin it for myself
21/05/2019, 09:56 - Paul;: Bask in the glory of 7 seasons
21/05/2019, 12:13 - Damian Rumble: My expectations were rock bottom going in and even then they managed to fuck up. Bran like wtf?
21/05/2019, 13:26 - David;: Nah that made sense. Couldn't be Jon or Dani too obvious.
21/05/2019, 13:27 - David;: Drogon did everyone a solid
21/05/2019, 13:27 - Jack G;: Bran the biggest douche though. He knew everything that would happen, but allowed it so he could rule
21/05/2019, 13:34 - Paul;: What did bran do?
21/05/2019, 13:39 - Damian Rumble: Sweet fuck all
21/05/2019, 13:39 - Damian Rumble: The ultimate troll....
21/05/2019, 13:40 - Paul;: I need more to go on
21/05/2019, 13:41 - Stefan;: People are debating whether Drogon was really smart (recognised that the lust for power represented by the throne killed Dany), or really stupid (thought the chair made of knives killed her with a knife)
21/05/2019, 13:41 - David;: Became king. That's the bullet point
21/05/2019, 13:42 - Jack G;: I like the symbolism of destroying the throne that caused all of the death over the last 8 seasons
21/05/2019, 13:42 - David;: Yeah
21/05/2019, 13:42 - David;: Worked
21/05/2019, 13:42 - Stefan;: It was a good moment
21/05/2019, 13:43 - Stefan;: Also liked the visual scene of Dany looking mega fascist on the ruined red keep
21/05/2019, 13:43 - David;: They salvaged an iota of credibility after a shit series
21/05/2019, 13:44 - Sam;: Yeah, just should have done it over 9 or 10 hour long episodes
21/05/2019, 13:45 - Paul;: I don’t recognise this series. Waiting for the remake
21/05/2019, 13:47 - Jack G;: There’s negative hype though, surely a go?
21/05/2019, 13:52 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/05/2019, 13:56 - Rob;: I like that Jon was sentenced to a life of service at Castle Black, then gets there and it's just his mate frousting
21/05/2019, 13:56 - Rob;: Him and Tormund and really let themselves go north of the wall now
21/05/2019, 13:57 - David;: Like a big Wales trip over the wall
21/05/2019, 13:58 - Rob;: Yeah. It'll be grand
21/05/2019, 15:08 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I enjoyed the overture to nazi Germany there...  Just about the only good bit of the final episode. All downhill from there...
21/05/2019, 15:10 - Damian Rumble: They literally couldn't have picked a character that it made less sense to be king. Literally zero back story or character development.
21/05/2019, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: Has ability to see all of time but can't be fucked to use it ... Make that man king and send the actual heir to the throne to wall to guard it from a threat that no longer exists...
21/05/2019, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: Butt hurt
21/05/2019, 15:14 - Paul;: Your butthurt is extreme
21/05/2019, 15:16 - Hamish Sinclair: But hes actually the king beyond the wall is t he? Complete stark domination, Stanza controls the north, bran controls he 6 kingdoms and aryeh is going to take over the world in her spin off series
21/05/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: Could really get behind some good old fashioned colonialism in that
21/05/2019, 15:49 - Stefan;: I'm hoping for a spin off comedy series about Tyrion's small council. Thick of It style.
21/05/2019, 16:36 - David;: Focussing mainly on communications strategy and the PR operation?
21/05/2019, 16:37 - David;: This was the whole point though. Didn't want it hence only person fit for it. Also because not the legitimate heir etc. it avoids the endless spiral of dynastic politics that got them into the war in the first place. Made sense to me
21/05/2019, 16:38 - David;: Plus seeing all of time. Get that on a throne of bread
21/05/2019, 16:41 - David;: The episode where Arya brings smallpox to a population lacking any immunity and causes accidental genocide. Looking forward to how they plug that into her post-feminist story arc.

22/05/2019, 21:38 - Rob;: Hello I'm Miss Nomer
22/05/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Hoppy being a trendy thing to say about beer these days, that makes a lager brewed by the world's second biggest distiller sound like a craft, indie ale
22/05/2019, 21:45 - Phill: Well they're not going to sell a beer that's called "Shart House" are they

22/05/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: Sam Thornton's Big Curry Buster
22/05/2019, 21:48 - Phill: Would like to start a brewery where the artwork is the deco-obcenia and the names of the drink are "Shart" which is a dark, malty ale, "Menstrual Discharge" which is a red ale. "Piss" a pale.
22/05/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: Next time I'm looking for something to draw I'll do that
22/05/2019, 21:50 - Phill: "Ass Pus"
22/05/2019, 21:50 - Phill: A sour.

22/05/2019, 21:52 - Phill: "Andy Colon" - a stout.
22/05/2019, 21:53 - David;: The over hopping of everything. It has to stop.
22/05/2019, 21:53 - Phill: I think that's why I've reverted back to lager recently.

22/05/2019, 21:54 - Rob;: Unhoppy customers
22/05/2019, 21:56 - Phill: The concept of the triple hop.

22/05/2019, 21:57 - Damian Rumble: Nah hops are great what are you on about
22/05/2019, 21:57 - Phill: "we need to hop this again"
22/05/2019, 21:57 - Phill: "one more time"
22/05/2019, 21:58 - Rob;: Are you off all pale ales because of the double hopping? Or is it just the gratuitous third?
22/05/2019, 21:59 - Phill: I'm a fan of the classic 4% refreshing pale ale. Its the 6%, thick, triple hopped syrups that troll
22/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: I really hate high % beer too
22/05/2019, 22:00 - Rob;: New York craft is rancid. 6.7% morning-ruiners

24/05/2019, 10:43 - Jack G;: Boris as PM, Trump as US president. We’ve fucked it

24/05/2019, 10:51 - / James Ball: Off she trots
24/05/2019, 10:55 - David;: Lol they're replaying the speech where she gets offered the P45. Why does she just meekly take it from him?
24/05/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Yeah, tear it up, could have been a good moment
24/05/2019, 10:58 - Jack G;: She’s not one for improvisation. Anything off script and she’s flustered
24/05/2019, 10:59 - David;: Last 3 conservative PMs all destroyed by Europe
24/05/2019, 11:38 - / James Ball: Jonson or Raab would also get a lot of hate from the majority of the UK as well
24/05/2019, 11:57 - David;: Lol Steve Baker is running
24/05/2019, 11:57 - David;: That would be hillarious
24/05/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: What’s happened to old mogg?
24/05/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: Thought he’d be right in this
24/05/2019, 12:02 - Rob;: Boris Hunt final two is my punt for the cunts
24/05/2019, 12:02 - David;: His little book on the Victorians got slaughtered though
24/05/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: Yeah, this is a good review
24/05/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/books/2019/05/jacob-rees-mogg-the-victorians-review
24/05/2019, 12:04 - Paul;: Just read that review
24/05/2019, 12:16 - Damian Rumble: That seems a good bet. Would love it Gove just steams in from no where to destroy Boris for a second time
24/05/2019, 12:17 - Hamish Sinclair: What's happened to raaaaaab
24/05/2019, 12:17 - David;: Grotting around still
24/05/2019, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: Steve baker has a very Oli from the thick of it vibe... Nerdy looking younger guy who thinks he's the man but is ultimately just a pawn
24/05/2019, 12:26 - / James Ball: Saw a Steve baker interview this morning. He seems like a total boring drip
24/05/2019, 12:44 - Paul;: Damo why you still voting for pleb dems? Go green
24/05/2019, 13:33 - David;: Manchester United have improved a £12m-a-year deal offered to Ajax defender Matthijs de Ligt
24/05/2019, 13:33 - David;: >£12m
24/05/2019, 13:36 - Damian Rumble: Lib Dems are basically the greens but we have actual policy rather than being a protest party
24/05/2019, 13:37 - David;: The policy of putting the tories into office
24/05/2019, 13:39 - Damian Rumble: The policy of putting liberal policy into action
24/05/2019, 13:39 - Stefan;: Lolllll
24/05/2019, 13:40 - Stefan;: They love austerity
24/05/2019, 13:41 - Stefan;: I'm at the vote count in Hackney, greens are smashing it
24/05/2019, 13:41 - Paul;: Dead party damo
24/05/2019, 13:41 - David;: 👍
24/05/2019, 13:41 - David;: More than expected?
24/05/2019, 13:42 - Stefan;: I think so yeah, but we haven't collated the data yet
24/05/2019, 13:42 - David;: They should get 10%+ of national vote share.
24/05/2019, 13:43 - David;: How do you get a sense of it - do the counters leak to the activists?
24/05/2019, 13:45 - Damian Rumble: You suspect the greens will be looking to mop up labour remainers. Lib Dems Tory and labour remainers. Whilst Brexit take all the hard Brexit vote. Going to be a blood bath for the main parties for sure...
24/05/2019, 13:48 - Stefan;: They're just counting the number of ballot papers at this stage. While they do that we can see the votes cast and do our own tally
24/05/2019, 13:48 - Stefan;: It's not mega accurate but we get a sample
24/05/2019, 13:49 - David;: estimated % of votes?
24/05/2019, 14:07 - / James Ball: I expect Tories 4th overall and labour 5th
24/05/2019, 14:08 - David;: Polls suggest Labour will get more votes than tories, but behind Brexit party and possibly Lib Dems
24/05/2019, 14:09 - Paul;: >shit dems
24/05/2019, 14:10 - / James Ball: I think:
brexit party
Ukip
Lib dems
Tories
labour
24/05/2019, 14:10 - / James Ball: Not sure where greens will fit in
24/05/2019, 14:13 - David;: No way UKIP will be that high, Brexit party will hoover up their votes.
24/05/2019, 14:13 - Paul;: UKIP will be bottom of that list
24/05/2019, 14:14 - Paul;: Brexit 
Labour
Lib
Green
Tory
24/05/2019, 14:15 - David;: Yeah, with UKIP/Change on like 3-4% each at the bottom.
24/05/2019, 14:15 - David;: Tories/Green will be close
24/05/2019, 14:34 - Damian Rumble: Ukip are dead
24/05/2019, 14:36 - / James Ball: I just have a feeling they'll resurge
24/05/2019, 14:37 - / James Ball: I'll be happy if they don't
24/05/2019, 14:37 - / James Ball: Change UK will be bottom I agree
24/05/2019, 15:45 - Stefan;: Turnout is flat or down (compared to 2014) in leave voting areas and up in remain areas
24/05/2019, 15:45 - Damian Rumble: https://twitter.com/PJHeneghan/status/1131934171524476928?s=08
24/05/2019, 15:45 - Damian Rumble: Evidence of the above
24/05/2019, 15:47 - Damian Rumble: Tbh that make sense to me. There is a very loud ultra Brexit contingent but I can't imagine why most people who voted for Brexit would bother to turn up to vote in a election they don't want and believe we will be rid of soon
24/05/2019, 16:11 - / James Ball: Yes exactly. Why vote people into a job you believe shouldn't exist
24/05/2019, 17:53 - David;: What's to stop non-conservatives signing up as members temporarily to vote against Boris then giving up membership the day after?
24/05/2019, 17:53 - David;: Other than fact it would give a temporary cash boost to tories
24/05/2019, 17:55 - Phill: Don't you have to have been a member for 3 months to get a vote?
24/05/2019, 18:23 - Phill: So I was on site today, and found two of our subcontractors asleep on a roof

28/05/2019, 08:44 - Paul;: Main issue was the bbq wouldn’t sink
28/05/2019, 08:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Dont remember us trying bags of shit to trees though, although not a huge leap from boiling piss
28/05/2019, 08:55 - Paul;: The grot of tying human shit to a tree. A new low we’re close to reaching

28/05/2019, 13:25 - Damian Rumble: BBC News - Alastair Campbell 'expelled' from Labour Party
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-48434842

I love how tone deaf this response from labour party is.. party member dares to vote for another party, along with many others, in protest at policy, contributing to one of the worse results on record. 

Obviously expelling that individual immediately is the proportionate response to demonstrate that the party is willing to listen to the voters and make an effort to win them  back. Thank you Mr Corbyn.
28/05/2019, 13:34 - Paul;: What happened with everyone not being able to get enough of Corbyn and annoyingly chanting his name? Where did they go?
28/05/2019, 13:38 - Jack G;: They finally realised that he’s a huge brexiteer despite attempting to claim otherwise
28/05/2019, 13:40 - Damian Rumble: It's been very quiet ever since he was outed as an anti-semite
28/05/2019, 13:41 - Damian Rumble: Even my card carrying corbynista housemate now thinks he should go
28/05/2019, 13:41 - Paul;: He was just a meme really

28/05/2019, 13:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Seems a slightly outdated policy, although I'm pretty sure most major parties apply this rule into their membership, the Tories kicked out Michael heseltine last week for the same reason
28/05/2019, 13:49 - Paul;: Didn’t he get wheeled out one year to great fanfare and even more chanting?
28/05/2019, 13:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Mainstage
28/05/2019, 13:54 - Paul;: Would have been good to see May brought out. With dancing. The sheer awkwardness would be worth it

06/06/2019, 21:07 - Damian Rumble: This match has got our semi final against Croatia in the world cup written all over it ...
06/06/2019, 21:07 - David;: I just want a bigger slice of Depay
06/06/2019, 21:20 - Jack G;: Ah
06/06/2019, 21:21 - David;: Predictable
06/06/2019, 21:21 - Jack G;: Walker has been shite
06/06/2019, 21:22 - David;: >Trent on the bench
06/06/2019, 21:29 - Sam;: Hiiiiiib
06/06/2019, 21:30 - David;: Hoot
06/06/2019, 21:30 - Jack G;: Honk
06/06/2019, 21:31 - Sam;: VAR-y harsh
06/06/2019, 21:32 - David;: Var shit
06/06/2019, 21:32 - Jack G;: Hate Var
06/06/2019, 21:32 - David;: Why don't we get to see?
06/06/2019, 21:33 - Sam;: Oh fuck
06/06/2019, 21:33 - Sam;: Not a penno against?
06/06/2019, 21:33 - David;: The butt hurt
06/06/2019, 21:34 - David;: This hand ball shit needs sorting out
06/06/2019, 21:34 - Jack G;: More Var than foot
06/06/2019, 21:35 - Paul;: Would be good to have a game where every pass has to be var checked
06/06/2019, 21:35 - Paul;: OVarload of the var
06/06/2019, 21:35 - David;: That's VAR too often
06/06/2019, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: Clearly I don't know the rules of football
06/06/2019, 21:42 - David;: Lingard makes things happen
06/06/2019, 21:42 - David;: Sniffs around
06/06/2019, 21:43 - David;: He'll sniff you out a little chance
06/06/2019, 21:56 - Damian Rumble: Fucl
06/06/2019, 21:56 - Jack G;: Wtf
06/06/2019, 21:56 - David;: How was that not cleared
06/06/2019, 21:57 - Jack G;: Stones
06/06/2019, 21:57 - David;: Walker fucks that
06/06/2019, 21:57 - David;: Puts Pickford off while not clearing it
06/06/2019, 21:58 - Jack G;: Can’t blame him for trying to block though
06/06/2019, 21:59 - David;: Yeah but I think Pickford gets there first without him
06/06/2019, 22:14 - Jack G;: What’s this new offside thing where they don’t flag because of Var? What’s the point in linesmen then
06/06/2019, 22:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, can see it being used as a time wasting tool when teams are ahead
06/06/2019, 22:16 - Damian Rumble: Amateur hour
06/06/2019, 22:17 - Jack G;: Defensive mistake FC
06/06/2019, 22:17 - Damian Rumble: Southgate has got to take some the wrap for this dodgy team selection
06/06/2019, 22:17 - Paul;: 6th fc
07/06/2019, 10:24 - Damian Rumble: Came a cross a cool feature on Spotify the other day. Normally on my own play lists you play a track to the end before beginning a new one (with some option of cross-fade). 

However, I picked up one of Spotify's own playlists that it had recommended to me. I noticed that in the new playlist, as a track ended... The the app would automatically find a convenient spot in the next playlist, beat match and fade over. The effect was so good that it took me several tracks to realise that I wasn't listening to a human recorded mix but rather the AI in Spotify was mixing live! 

I thought that was pretty cool...
07/06/2019, 10:25 - Damian Rumble: I had the playlist on shuffle btw
07/06/2019, 10:25 - Rob;: Is that something you need to turn on?
07/06/2019, 10:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Woold be interesting to repeat that over the same playlist and see if it goes the same route each time
07/06/2019, 10:26 - Hamish Sinclair: How do you turn it on?
07/06/2019, 10:32 - David;: I don't like change
07/06/2019, 10:32 - Damian Rumble: I had a good look around and couldn't find anything signalling as the where this feature is. My bet is that they are training thier neural net models it in a number of pre-set playlists before making it widely available. Watch this space.
07/06/2019, 10:33 - Damian Rumble: I found this playlist list under the 'keep the vibe going' section
07/06/2019, 10:33 - David;: An how much Mandy had you had when this occured?
07/06/2019, 10:34 - Damian Rumble: Well I am at work right now... But it is a Friday...

07/06/2019, 22:12 - Phill: Yeah
07/06/2019, 22:12 - Phill: Amber is actually fit. Was thinking of that hog that coupled up with Sherif.
07/06/2019, 22:15 - David;: Ah yeah I meant Amy as well

07/06/2019, 22:23 - David;: Every advert synchs into the same vibe. Impossible to tell where the adverts stop and the show begins

08/06/2019, 14:26 - David;: Just at sainsbury's. Asian guy in front of me had cleaned them out of celery and bought nothing else
08/06/2019, 14:26 - David;: About 30 packs of celery
08/06/2019, 14:26 - David;: That's the whole shop
08/06/2019, 14:28 - David;: Curious to know what is long-term strategy is for that quantity of celery
08/06/2019, 14:28 - David;: *his
08/06/2019, 14:28 - Jack G;: Huge batch of soup?
08/06/2019, 14:29 - Jack G;: Just honking soup for the next week
08/06/2019, 14:34 - David;: Pure celery soup. That's a very close diet. Would go right through you
08/06/2019, 14:34 - David;: Not enough to sustain a human surely
08/06/2019, 14:35 - / James Ball: Celery is so shit tier except as a flavourant
08/06/2019, 14:35 - / James Ball: maybe he was going to pickle it or something asian
08/06/2019, 14:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Essential for bloody Mary's

09/06/2019, 09:39 - Rob;: 1. Needlessly doubling down on something that caused huge controversy last year
09/06/2019, 09:39 - Rob;: 2. Just the idea of having a president/dictator as your best man. They can't get to hang out _that_ often

09/06/2019, 12:25 - Damian Rumble: I actually find Michael Gove more appealing now he's confessed to being a coked up hack 20 years ago. Like we all know Boris was the same but he still tries to hide it from everyone because it's politically advantageous...
09/06/2019, 12:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Think that's exactly why hes done it damo, you've fallen for it 🎣
09/06/2019, 12:43 - Damian Rumble: Haha could be. Assumed Boris had leaked a story as revenge for knifing him in 2016...
09/06/2019, 12:44 - Stefan;: Can you imagine anything worse than being stuck with a coked up Gove at a party
09/06/2019, 12:49 - Damian Rumble: Being at the same party in a circle of people including Teresa May... one by one everyone leaves until you realise you've been left as the only person talking to her and can't now escape without looking like a massive douche. She then proceeds to have a breakdown about how Boris bullied her out of office and you have to stay there and comfort her whilst simultaneously wishing you could tell her exactly what you thought/get out of there as quickly as possible.
09/06/2019, 12:51 - Paul;: >massive douche

09/06/2019, 22:08 - Damian Rumble: I am on tenterhooks to see if the power plant goes full meltdown and takes out all of eastern Europe... no spoilers, please!
09/06/2019, 22:12 - Rob;: Ha
09/06/2019, 22:12 - Rob;: On ep 3

10/06/2019, 20:08 - Sam;: I’m on episode three. Just got to the miners all working naked. Brilliant
10/06/2019, 20:29 - David;: Where can I watch this?
10/06/2019, 20:31 - Sam;: Sky tv only. Or some filthy wretched illegal stream
10/06/2019, 20:31 - David;: Write off
10/06/2019, 20:39 - Rob;: Now TV
10/06/2019, 22:04 - David;: Matt Hancock has a Neil from the office vibe
10/06/2019, 22:05 - David;: Bland motivational speak
10/06/2019, 22:30 - Damian Rumble: I love how pensioners are losing thier shit over having to pay for a TV licence now. Like you got free higher education, lived through the summer of love, got jobs and cheap property in the 80s boom years and then got to fuck everyone over by voting for brexit... But oh no...now I have to pay £144 a year to 'keep in touch with the world because I have no friends'. Cry me a River bitches.
10/06/2019, 22:38 - David;: Manchester United will give Spain goalkeeper David de Gea £20m if the 28-year-old leaves for Paris St-Germain this summer.
10/06/2019, 22:39 - David;: Sam thoughts?
10/06/2019, 22:39 - David;: Paying him to leave

11/06/2019, 11:54 - David;: Booked ByC Friday 23rd - Tuesday 27th.
11/06/2019, 11:54 - David;: 4 nights if we want it, or we could go back on the Monday and just 3 nights. Don't mind.

11/06/2019, 12:06 - Paul;: Can we sort out our substance ordering? Is anyone out there competent enough to order?

11/06/2019, 18:05 - David;: Hope they fix the fucking weapon system
11/06/2019, 18:05 - Paul;: What’s wrong with the weapon system?
11/06/2019, 18:06 - David;: All your weapons break constantly
11/06/2019, 18:07 - David;: So never feels that good getting anything new and there's no point using the decent weapons
11/06/2019, 18:07 - David;: Better to use the shit weapons most of the time
11/06/2019, 18:08 - Rob;: You see why they have them break, but they just need to give you _some_ time with the good stuff
11/06/2019, 18:08 - Rob;: Very pleased to be getting another game
11/06/2019, 18:08 - Jack G;: Yeah hopefully they increase weapon durability
11/06/2019, 18:09 - David;: Why? Skyrim works fine without that mechanic.
11/06/2019, 18:09 - Jack G;: #Realism
11/06/2019, 18:11 - David;: So it's real for a sword to break after swinging it 10 times Jack? Is it real to live in a world called Hyrule with fairies and divine beasts and magical creatures Jack?
11/06/2019, 18:11 - Sam;: Lol
11/06/2019, 18:12 - Paul;: Jack have you been in hyrule again
11/06/2019, 18:12 - David;: I don't play Zelda for the gritty realism
11/06/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: A lot of the game is about making the best of the resources you have, getting better at using them wisely. I think you need some level of weapon damage so you can't just kill one Lynel once and use its sword to kill everything forever in one hit
11/06/2019, 18:14 - Rob;: Weapons go, you just have to get used to it
11/06/2019, 18:15 - Rob;: Had a battle axe once, chopped 10 woods, battle axe ded, move on
11/06/2019, 18:15 - David;: Jaaaaack
11/06/2019, 18:15 - Jack G;: Never said I was happy about it, was playing Devils advocate
11/06/2019, 18:15 - Jack G;: Dick Advocate
11/06/2019, 18:16 - Rob;: Devil's advocaat
11/06/2019, 18:17 - Paul;: Only 10 wood
11/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: Basically I enjoyed Skyrim much more and that was exclusively to do with the weapons system. The world in Zelda is bigger and better but it completely ruined my enjoyment of it
11/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: Destroyed any sense of progression
11/06/2019, 18:18 - Paul;: Still get weapon fatigue in that?
11/06/2019, 18:18 - Jack G;: Dat Zelda music though Dave
11/06/2019, 18:19 - Rob;: I love this so much https://youtu.be/Gjlo3-V4_hA

11/06/2019, 18:27 - David;: 'all I know is father's day'
11/06/2019, 18:27 - Jack G;: Will trade you 10 wood for 3 wheat, 2 sheep and a brick
11/06/2019, 18:30 - David;: No. Mana drains in magical weapons but you can recharge. Weapons don't break. Changes absolutely everything
11/06/2019, 18:32 - Phill: Classic WoW > all
11/06/2019, 18:32 - Phill: Taken a week off to honk it
11/06/2019, 18:33 - David;: Can it ever be the same without being in the clan?
11/06/2019, 18:33 - David;: Without the corporate structure
11/06/2019, 18:33 - David;: The org chart
11/06/2019, 18:34 - Jack G;: So much time required though. Basically turns into a second job
11/06/2019, 18:34 - Jack G;: But I agree >all

11/06/2019, 18:35 - David;: Nah
11/06/2019, 18:35 - David;: Do you get your old role back or have to re-apply?
11/06/2019, 18:35 - Phill: Yeah yeah yeah.
11/06/2019, 18:35 - Jack G;: Are you still playing as a gnome Phil?
11/06/2019, 18:35 - David;: Climb the greasy pole once more
11/06/2019, 18:35 - Phill: Lol I get my old role back
11/06/2019, 18:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Do we have an objective way of measuring your performance at work during this period?
11/06/2019, 18:36 - Phill: Yeah yeah. Gnome lock.
11/06/2019, 18:37 - David;: Senior assistant Gnome Lock
11/06/2019, 18:37 - David;: Should get business cards
11/06/2019, 18:37 - Phill: But I've taken the week off work to get the bulk of the levelling out the way
11/06/2019, 18:38 - Jack G;: Please speak to my PA Void Walker for any urgent enquires
11/06/2019, 18:38 - Phill: Then it's just evenings grinding dungeons

11/06/2019, 19:42 - David;: 👍
11/06/2019, 20:22 - David;: Rob, fun biology fact. When humans shagged Neanderthals it only ever produced female children
11/06/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: Interesting
11/06/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: So did they have an inviable Y chromosome?
11/06/2019, 20:32 - Rob;: Unviable
11/06/2019, 20:34 - Rob;: We only got proper evidence of the first neanderthal-sapiens cross breeding last year
11/06/2019, 20:36 - Rob;: Ah, that was first neaderthal-denisovan  cross
11/06/2019, 20:37 - Phill: https://youtu.be/qQEYrNpYIO0
11/06/2019, 20:39 - David;: Quite the wrong cross
11/06/2019, 20:39 - David;: Not sure, I'm in a conversation with a very eccentric old man who seems to know a lot about human evolution but might also be talking bollocks
11/06/2019, 20:40 - Rob;: I see
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: It makes sort of sense - as species get more distance their ability to breed gradually decreases, rather than stopping immediately
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: Like how you can get a mule, ass, liger or tigon etc
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: I wish other human species had made it. Would have made the world more fun
11/06/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: /violent

11/06/2019, 20:43 - Rob;: You're worried enough your kid will get bullied already
11/06/2019, 20:44 - David;: So the Asians were all over the densovans
11/06/2019, 20:45 - David;: Loved a bit of exotic denisovan daliance
11/06/2019, 20:45 - David;: We were loving the Neanderthals. Africans were just nah we'll stick to actual humans
11/06/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: There were probably far more different human species and sub-species in Africa that never left though
11/06/2019, 20:46 - Rob;: Ethnic africans have far more genetic diversity than people with other backgrounds
11/06/2019, 20:47 - David;: Do you think it was a bit of a faux par to have shagged a denisovan. Like you'd had a real grotty mad one
11/06/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: They split off from neanderthals
11/06/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: Probably a good feed ten thousand years when it was fine

12/06/2019, 14:08 - Rob;: He was great on fantasy around that time. Super cheap because mistakes were always his fault, so no one go him in, but Wigan actually came like 11th and conceded relatively few goals, and fantasy punishes all defenders equally

18/06/2019, 18:15 - David;: The silent pig fucking majority
18/06/2019, 18:15 - Paul;: Very bat like face
18/06/2019, 18:15 - Paul;: Javid that is
18/06/2019, 18:15 - Damian Rumble: I need to see that
18/06/2019, 18:16 - Jack G;: 70% of the Tory membership said they’d rather see the end of the party than lose brexit
18/06/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: There were rumours that Johnson was lending some votes to Hunt as he thought he was the least threatening of those likely to make top 2
18/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: So we're not proroguing
18/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: I'm prorogue
18/06/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: Though as Johnson gained votes I guess that didn't happen
18/06/2019, 18:17 - David;: Not pro choice
18/06/2019, 18:18 - Damian Rumble: I think that the destruction of the conservative party is pretty much guaranteed either way
18/06/2019, 18:18 - Jack G;: Rory the Tory sneaking through
18/06/2019, 18:19 - Damian Rumble: I'm definitely team Rory. The only sane one left. We need to see someone whose not afraid to call Boris on this bullshit, rather than trying to peddle thier own bullshit
18/06/2019, 18:19 - David;: It really isn't. This is such a fantasy unfortunately. It just means they have to inflict a no deal brexit on us all to appease their members
18/06/2019, 18:20 - David;: Basically there are more cunts, so they have to brand themselves purely to cunts. Then they'll be fine again
18/06/2019, 18:20 - Rob;: Can't wait for the hardship to forge our generation into something great
18/06/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: Can't wait to be lauded as a hero for going without salad for two years
18/06/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: Get us a cenotaph
18/06/2019, 18:21 - Damian Rumble: No deal brexit = massive damage to the economy and the more central parts of the part defecting to the Tories. 

No brexit = massive damage to the Tories reputation and the majority of thier voters defecting to Nigel Farage
18/06/2019, 18:23 - Paul;: Never forget how you want to have a computer ruling over all of us
18/06/2019, 18:23 - Damian Rumble: Would happily take the computer right now...
18/06/2019, 18:24 - Jack G;: Who computes the computer?
18/06/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: Damian writes the algorithm
18/06/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: It’s his perfect society
18/06/2019, 18:25 - Jack G;: So an authoritarian regime disguised as a technocracy
18/06/2019, 18:26 - Paul;: Yeah Damian is in fact the most right wing
18/06/2019, 18:26 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/06/2019, 18:27 - Rob;: The computer would still get embroiled in an expenses scandal, or have an affair or something. Power corrupts
18/06/2019, 18:28 - Damian Rumble: The computer is computed by an even bigger computer...  jack have you not read hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy?
18/06/2019, 18:29 - Jack G;: Computers all the way down
18/06/2019, 18:32 - David;: “It’s the arrogance. It’s the contempt. That’s what gets me. It’s Gordon Brown’s apparent belief that he can just trample on the democratic will of the British people. It’s at moments like this that I think the political world has gone mad, and I am alone in detecting the gigantic fraud.” 

“They voted for Anthony Charles Lynton Blair to serve as their leader. They were at no stage invited to vote on whether Gordon Brown should be PM… They voted for Tony, and yet they now get Gordon, and a transition about as democratically proper as the transition from Claudius to Nero. It is a scandal. Why are we all conniving in this stitch-up? This is nothing less than a palace coup… with North Korean servility, the Labour Party has handed power over to the brooding Scottish power-maniac.”
18/06/2019, 18:32 - David;: Amazing he's not got more stick for this
18/06/2019, 18:33 - Jack G;: The lack of accountability in politics these days is mental
18/06/2019, 18:34 - David;: “The extraordinary thing is that it looks as though he will now be in 10 Downing Street for three years, and without a mandate from the British people. No one elected Gordon Brown as Prime Minister”
18/06/2019, 18:34 - Damian Rumble: It's because the been avoiding press coverage.... Page 1 of the "Teresa may manual on how to fuck up an election"
18/06/2019, 18:35 - Damian Rumble: He's*
18/06/2019, 19:04 - David;: Rob what's the value of your Q these days?
18/06/2019, 20:03 - David;: Lol
18/06/2019, 20:03 - David;: >bbc
18/06/2019, 20:04 - David;: Literally led with the question he would have picked himself
18/06/2019, 20:08 - Rob;: Haven't heard much about my Q
18/06/2019, 20:09 - Rob;: It's not lost value, I can tell you that
18/06/2019, 20:32 - David;: A real array of cunts
18/06/2019, 20:32 - David;: A concatenation of cunts
18/06/2019, 20:33 - / James Ball: if they are concatenated then they surely become a human centipede of cunts
18/06/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Rory Stewart best of a shite bunch.
18/06/2019, 20:34 - David;: I was thinking more of ideological linkage
18/06/2019, 20:34 - David;: Yea
18/06/2019, 20:35 - Phill: Whichever body language  psychologist invented this needs lynching.
18/06/2019, 20:35 - / James Ball: I would be interested to know what people think will happen with the eu after a no deal brexit
18/06/2019, 20:35 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/06/2019, 20:36 - / James Ball: pointing without the point
18/06/2019, 20:36 - David;: A pointless point
18/06/2019, 20:38 - Phill: Saj with the double thumb point
18/06/2019, 20:40 - / James Ball: also why are they all sat on those stools
18/06/2019, 20:40 - / James Ball: i can't actually watch it it's such a painful cringe fest
18/06/2019, 20:41 - Phill: Blue on blue
18/06/2019, 20:43 - Phill: >my Muslim great grandfather
18/06/2019, 20:59 - Phill: Lol that music
18/06/2019, 20:59 - Phill: "what music for the debate?"
18/06/2019, 21:00 - Phill: "aggressive strings?"
18/06/2019, 21:01 - Phill: Thank god. It's time for Dint Island.
18/06/2019, 21:02 - David;: Yeah me and Hamish were saying at the weekend how many people in the UK way the whole of the Tory leader debate directly followed by love island
18/06/2019, 21:03 - David;: *watch
18/06/2019, 21:06 - Phill: Blend Molly and Amber. The ultimate rut bot.
18/06/2019, 21:07 - David;: Lol, two very different bodies to blend. Are you meaning complete merge or taking some features intact and combining with others?
18/06/2019, 21:07 - David;: You'd end up with hair half way between frizzy and black and straight and blonde.
18/06/2019, 21:08 - Phill: Just taking the best features
18/06/2019, 21:10 - Phill: >Maura
18/06/2019, 21:10 - Phill: Yewande and Vincent Kompany not working.
18/06/2019, 21:11 - David;: Maura made up is an entirely different human to without make up
18/06/2019, 21:11 - David;: Like when you see the red woman in game of thrones in her true state
18/06/2019, 21:11 - Phill: Lol. He personality is rancid as well.
18/06/2019, 21:12 - Phill: Shes like a fly in your bedroom when you're trying to sleep and you can hear it buzzing.
18/06/2019, 21:21 - David;: Elma so rotten
18/06/2019, 21:25 - David;: Accent repulsive
18/06/2019, 21:26 - Phill: Yeah
18/06/2019, 21:33 - Phill: Anna. Foul. Such an oversized arse. Unnecessary volume.
18/06/2019, 21:33 - David;: Yeah, and awful face
18/06/2019, 21:33 - David;: The box ticker
18/06/2019, 21:34 - David;: Maura looks like old Michael Jackson
18/06/2019, 21:35 - David;: Pretty much only Lucie, Molly and Amber fit
18/06/2019, 21:36 - Sam;: This slo mo regurgitation is great
18/06/2019, 21:36 - David;: Lol yeah
18/06/2019, 21:36 - David;: Really grotting into it
18/06/2019, 21:37 - David;: Maura's got a turn
18/06/2019, 21:37 - Sam;: Passing mustard a highlight
18/06/2019, 21:37 - Sam;: Milk looking most grotty
18/06/2019, 21:38 - David;: He was caught passing mustard on the tube. 3 years in wormwood scrubs.
19/06/2019, 10:00 - Stefan;: https://twitter.com/michaeljswalker/status/1141065859118567424?s=19
Rory Stewart is Damo on a big come-up
19/06/2019, 10:09 - Damian Rumble: Haha
19/06/2019, 10:39 - Rob;: So true
19/06/2019, 10:49 - Hamish Sinclair: 👍that's great, looks like hes licked the knife clean again
19/06/2019, 15:52 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
19/06/2019, 15:52 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
19/06/2019, 15:53 - Hamish Sinclair: I blame the dog
19/06/2019, 16:58 - David;: Stefan where does the gay vote shift now Raab is gone?
19/06/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: Is Boris a sort of polar bear?
19/06/2019, 17:02 - Rob;: Rory a cub?
19/06/2019, 17:04 - David;: Rory the Twink, with his cheeky walking
19/06/2019, 17:04 - Phill: Lol. >Twink
19/06/2019, 17:04 - Phill: Boris "Johnson" Johnson
19/06/2019, 17:11 - Rob;: I think I want a full gay profile of them all
19/06/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: And that's how politics should be done now
19/06/2019, 17:12 - David;: You should draw that probably
19/06/2019, 17:12 - Stefan;: Lol, Rob and Dave you know more than I'd credited you for 👍
19/06/2019, 17:14 - Stefan;: The vote will be scattered   - Rory is the ageing twink type, Boris could be the "bi-curious" married daddy (but that's a stretch)
19/06/2019, 17:14 - Stefan;: Raab was the great unifier
19/06/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: Are there even terms for people like Javid, perfect dome men?
19/06/2019, 17:22 - David;: The egg bat hybrid
19/06/2019, 17:23 - Rob;: Asian Mr Burns, as Hamish once said
19/06/2019, 17:24 - Stefan;: We're still working on a sub-tribe for that look - very difficult to categorise
19/06/2019, 17:25 - Stefan;: He does have gay face though
19/06/2019, 17:25 - David;: Hunt could be an earnest otter
19/06/2019, 17:25 - David;: Probably shaves his chest or something weird though
19/06/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: I don't think Hunt could handle being gay
19/06/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: He's not fun enough
19/06/2019, 17:27 - David;: No he is the straightest man alive
19/06/2019, 17:27 - Rob;: Is this a look that lets you know someone is gay?
19/06/2019, 17:27 - David;: Be surprised if Gove hasn't dabbled
19/06/2019, 17:27 - Rob;: Yeah, the ventriloquist doll sub-sect of being gay
19/06/2019, 17:28 - David;: Some coke fueled chemsex here and there
19/06/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: Probably a bit of public school wanking off an older boy
19/06/2019, 17:29 - Stefan;: Literally just how someone's face looks in a photo - you can usually tell
19/06/2019, 17:29 - Stefan;: Gove was 100% someone's fag at school
19/06/2019, 17:29 - David;: Yeah yeah
19/06/2019, 17:29 - Stefan;: But he is also a lizard in a human suit
19/06/2019, 17:30 - Rob;: And a little boy whose been accidentally made CEO
19/06/2019, 17:31 - David;: It's like when you see those public school teenagers who've dressed up in nice suits and are still drunk on it
19/06/2019, 17:32 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
19/06/2019, 17:32 - Rob;: Like the Tory teenager getting to ask a question on Question Time
19/06/2019, 17:33 - Rob;: Overcome with excitement
19/06/2019, 17:34 - David;: Yeah, has come to question time dressed in a tweed jacket and tie
19/06/2019, 17:34 - David;: Possibly even a waistcoat
19/06/2019, 17:36 - Stefan;: They are the very worst
19/06/2019, 17:36 - Rob;: The thickest triple Windsor knot in the tie
19/06/2019, 17:36 - Stefan;: Trying to think who at Chippy would have been like that. Joe Taylor is the closest match but still far off
19/06/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: I had Joe Taylor in mind
19/06/2019, 17:39 - David;: Yeah Taylor
19/06/2019, 17:39 - Rob;: I thought Lacey for a second
19/06/2019, 17:40 - Rob;: But that's something different
19/06/2019, 17:40 - Rob;: Sort of forced and repressed and military
19/06/2019, 17:40 - David;: Lacy too mild, not smug or punchable enough
19/06/2019, 17:41 - David;: Lacks the real abrasive jarring vibe
19/06/2019, 17:53 - Paul;: Gove would be one of those leather wearing dog gimps
19/06/2019, 17:54 - David;: Probably with a huge shit fetish as well
19/06/2019, 17:56 - Paul;: Always carries a funnel
19/06/2019, 18:10 - David;: Stewart ded
19/06/2019, 18:16 - Sam;: So it’s still all to play for then? As boris has less than half the votes.
19/06/2019, 18:35 - / James Ball: Hunt? Gove?
19/06/2019, 18:38 - David;: No thanks
19/06/2019, 18:39 - Jack G;: NEXT
19/06/2019, 18:42 - Sam;: Javid would be manageable.after that, it’s the choice between a bullet to the head (boris), a punch in the face (Hunt) or a flying kick to the bollock (Gove).
19/06/2019, 18:43 - David;: I think now we just take Boris in the hope he brings the house down with him
19/06/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: Can’t be dealing with Javid egg bat though
19/06/2019, 18:47 - David;: A bat and a gimp and a cunt and a toff and a bucket of vindaloo
19/06/2019, 18:47 - David;: Bucket!
19/06/2019, 18:53 - David;: We're Tories
We're going to score no deal for you
Tories!
A bat and a gimp and a cunt and a toff
We're off to leave EU
A bat and a gimp and a cunt and a toff
And a bucket of Vindaloo
Bucket!
19/06/2019, 18:56 - Sam;: Would love to stomp and shout that in Wales
19/06/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: And you shall
19/06/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: We should all do it down into Dolgellau
19/06/2019, 20:33 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/06/2019, 20:34 - David;: How is this even happening?
19/06/2019, 20:35 - Sam;: Can’t choose which to spaff in?
19/06/2019, 20:36 - David;: Not a pair among them
19/06/2019, 20:36 - David;: It's a closed system.
19/06/2019, 20:57 - / James Ball: Stuck in the machine?
19/06/2019, 21:07 - Damian Rumble: tfw watching the England Women's team play and thinking "they all look very datable" but in reality most of them are probably in violation of the half your age plus 7 rule....
19/06/2019, 21:17 - / James Ball: tfw you're already a creepy old pedo at the age of 30
19/06/2019, 21:20 - / James Ball: Are the Japanese ladies not datable though?
19/06/2019, 21:25 - Damian Rumble: personally I'm not that into Asians but I'm sure they are
19/06/2019, 21:28 - David;: When the gander's away the goose will play
19/06/2019, 21:31 - / James Ball: *but not with Asians
19/06/2019, 22:07 - Phill: Most of the dints on love island are 20-23. Would fuck them all.
19/06/2019, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: That rule is actually getting obstructive now. Was a time when it just made sure you wernt an actual peado
20/06/2019, 08:28 - Damian Rumble: Imagine.... In 5 to10 years HBO or someone else are going to make 'Brexit' into a big budget political drama with loads of sex, drugs and betrayals... I mean literally all the ingredients are there.
20/06/2019, 08:35 - Rob;: If the sex is there I'm not sure I want to see
20/06/2019, 09:00 - / James Ball: But if they adapted the story so it was actually set in southern California and everyone played by 20 somethings
20/06/2019, 09:05 - / James Ball: A touching scene where Michel barnier comes back up the beach from surfing and has an intimate moment with a young Angela Merkel in her cadillac overlooking the sunset. A little tetê-à-tetê because their friend Terri May really does want to leave the surf club :(
20/06/2019, 09:20 - Damian Rumble: Boris would be a great character. Constantly blathering about in the background of the early series causing problems by sleeping with peoples wives and shameless plotting ineffectively before becoming one of the main protagonists in a later series
20/06/2019, 09:23 - Rob;: Party boy journalist Mitch Gove
20/06/2019, 09:24 - Rob;: Doing coke off his surfboard as he files copy for the Santa Monica Chronicle
20/06/2019, 09:46 - Phill: Other characters include Surf Club treasurer Davey Davis
20/06/2019, 09:48 - Phill: The kid who is not allowed in the surf club because he's a dweeb Jake Mogg
20/06/2019, 09:53 - Phill: Angie was sitting on Michaels board as Jake stepped into the beach hut cafe.
"What do you want Jake?" Groaned Angie. 
"I want access to the beach hut but don't want to be a member of the surf club." Said Jake, peering over his faded Oakley sunglasses. He approached Angie, his pale, hands resting in the pockets of his Hi-Tec swim shorts. He leaned in to her and hissed coldly into her ear "I'm taking the surf club down".
20/06/2019, 09:57 - / James Ball: Possible titles:
Terri in the middle
Surf-it 🏄🏼‍♀
Surf means surf!

20/06/2019, 10:00 - Phill: <Media omitted>
20/06/2019, 10:00 - / James Ball: I think the character B-Jon should be black and continually arrested but released for spray painting graffiti on busses
20/06/2019, 10:01 - / James Ball: Last time I was in San Francisco there were pink "make America gay again" hats which seemed to be quite popular
20/06/2019, 10:04 - Rob;: Surf in Name Only
20/06/2019, 13:11 - Damian Rumble: The bat is out
20/06/2019, 13:14 - Jack G;: When the bats are out the cunts come out to play
20/06/2019, 14:04 - David;: 👍
20/06/2019, 15:37 - Rob;: The three left in the Tory I race are the three who got the most votes in the first ballot. Everything since has been pointless
20/06/2019, 15:38 - Rob;: They didn't do this for Theresa May

20/06/2019, 15:49 - Damian Rumble: I live in Islington and can confirm this is accurate
20/06/2019, 15:52 - Rob;: It's the worst video ever
20/06/2019, 15:52 - Rob;: Imagine thinking that's good satire
20/06/2019, 16:22 - Damian Rumble: Pretty much true of 99% of the internet today....
20/06/2019, 16:28 - Hamish Sinclair: THe account that posted it is pretty terrifying though

20/06/2019, 16:36 - David;: I did enjoy that
20/06/2019, 18:03 - Damian Rumble: Got no time for Hunt. It's got to be Boris Vs Gove. Purely in it for the drama now
20/06/2019, 18:04 - Hamish Sinclair: I part agree with that, if the worlds going to burn might aswell make it exciting
20/06/2019, 18:04 - Jack G;: You just know Boris has donated some votes to hunt though
20/06/2019, 18:04 - Jack G;: Easier win with the members

20/06/2019, 18:21 - David;: Yeah pointless
20/06/2019, 18:21 - David;: A month long Tory party political broadcast sanctioned by the bbc
20/06/2019, 18:22 - Jack G;: The insane media coverage pushing the idea that this it’s way more democratic than it actually is
20/06/2019, 18:30 - Jack G;: Illusion probably a better word than idea there
20/06/2019, 18:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Conservative leadership elections always portrayed as exciting process of strong candidates Vs labour leadership election which was portrayed as a circus
20/06/2019, 18:34 - David;: How butt hurt the media would be if it was labour membership electing Corbyn as PM

20/06/2019, 22:07 - Phill: This guy's nickname is Rutter

21/06/2019, 21:28 - David;: Clear he fancies new dint

24/06/2019, 21:21 - Sam;: One of my favourite fuck ups in a long time. Basically staring the gusset in the eye then just decide to call her slag in ear shot. 

“Can’t wait to see if she’s as much of a slut as I’m hoping, see ya lata boyzzz”. “Oh you heard that Maura did you sweetheart?”

25/06/2019, 10:15 - Rob;: Our estate agents tried to charge us a £200 renewal fee one day before it became illegal to charge those fees to tenants
25/06/2019, 10:17 - David;: The estate agent I just used refused to explain to me how the first rent had been calculated - all she would say is 'the figure is correct'. Had to work it out through a process of deduction.
25/06/2019, 10:21 - David;: They are delightful
25/06/2019, 11:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Love the response, hope you sent this

25/06/2019, 11:34 - David;: Cheers mate, you've saved me 30 seconds on google
25/06/2019, 11:35 - David;: Damian they need disrupting. Why are you spending your time ruining democracy and human relationships rather than fucking over estate agents?
25/06/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: They've done a good job of stoking fear of what happens when you cut them out I reckon
25/06/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: They offer a better service and more protection to landlords than they do to tenants, and it's landlords who would decide whether to use them
25/06/2019, 11:50 - David;: Yea but all that easy to solve. E.g. a deposit holding platform, some sort of tenancy vetting and matching platform
25/06/2019, 11:51 - David;: And they would reduce fees for landlords
25/06/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: Yeah, would certainly be better
25/06/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: I think they've just spun such a good web of lies about the risk of squatters etc
25/06/2019, 11:52 - David;: Lol but how are they specifically stopping that?
25/06/2019, 11:52 - David;: That's more the law/police.
25/06/2019, 11:53 - David;: They don't handle evictions personally
25/06/2019, 11:54 - Rob;: But better on paper at sorting out a legally tight contract, and being able to initiate that process
25/06/2019, 11:54 - Rob;: I agree they're total shit wankers
25/06/2019, 11:57 - David;: Except they don't they use standard templates.
25/06/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: But also see why landlords don't mind them organising all the shit for them
25/06/2019, 11:58 - David;: I've rented out my flat without agents and the government provides a template lease contract. It's so easy to do.
25/06/2019, 11:58 - Rob;: But does old Maureen know that, David?
25/06/2019, 12:51 - David;: Lampard at Chelsea could be hillarious

25/06/2019, 13:13 - David;: Just ask them direct for referee details and proof of income/bank statements. That's all they collect.
25/06/2019, 13:16 - Paul;: I have too much fear of not using an estate agent
25/06/2019, 13:16 - Paul;: The squatters
25/06/2019, 13:20 - David;: They've got you
25/06/2019, 13:21 - Paul;: Also they do have easy contact with people wanting to move in straight away
25/06/2019, 13:21 - David;: Looked up 'daylight robbery' I the dictionary - there was just a picture of Paul transferring a month's worth of rent to his estate agent for 20 mins work.
25/06/2019, 13:22 - David;: As does spareroom.com
25/06/2019, 13:24 - Paul;: Would use again
25/06/2019, 13:24 - David;: Would suck cock for tennants
25/06/2019, 13:24 - Paul;: Lol
25/06/2019, 17:24 - Damian Rumble: Not entirely sure why I am ruining democracy or why it's my responsibility to be fucking over estate agents.
25/06/2019, 17:26 - Damian Rumble: Our one let us an empty property with multiple promises that it would be fully furnished. Then it turned out fully furnished meant beds only we put up a right fuss and got £100 out of them and a note that said "take it up with the landlord this ain't our problem". Good to know that admin fee was going to something useful...

25/06/2019, 21:54 - Stefan;: Maybe Tesco created a relish that will actually last until 20140 AD
25/06/2019, 21:55 - Rob;: They tell you when a product is on offer by saying 'it's from two days into week commencing week 37 to end of week 41'
25/06/2019, 21:55 - Rob;: Does not correspond to weeks of the year, nor weeks of the financial year

25/06/2019, 21:59 - David;: What's it's baseline?

25/06/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: We have a conversation chart on the wall
25/06/2019, 22:03 - Paul;: But week 1 isn’t from first week of the year?
25/06/2019, 22:06 - David;: Too obvious
25/06/2019, 22:06 - David;: So you're not allowed to know?
25/06/2019, 22:06 - David;: It's like Scientology when you reach level 8 you learn the week system.
25/06/2019, 22:07 - David;: Lol basing it to the Julian calender. Can't get over that. No note or anything - should just be obvious.

03/07/2019, 22:21 - Phill: Yeah she can fuck off. Giving Michael shit when she walks back in with Chad.
03/07/2019, 22:21 - David;: But she's setting herself up for next level degrees of butt hurt
03/07/2019, 23:57 - Damian Rumble: Quote of the weekend... "If Glastonbury has taught me anything about myself it's that I can store a disproportionate amount of piss within my body. In one sitting I managed to fill up an entire 750ml bottle and a 500ml bottle as well" - @447752458076

04/07/2019, 21:38 - Sam;: She’s a Poundland Kardashian
04/07/2019, 21:38 - Phill: >feminism
04/07/2019, 21:39 - David;: Yeah, why is no one pointing out she did exactly the same thing
04/07/2019, 21:45 - David;: Also why Curtis is humoring all Amy's bullshit
04/07/2019, 21:47 - Sam;: He has mugged her off by going after jourdan but everyone talks about him like he’s a monster
04/07/2019, 21:47 - David;: Got to embrace it
04/07/2019, 21:47 - David;: Put shit in bin

07/07/2019, 17:37 - David;: Ruining football
07/07/2019, 17:37 - Hamish Sinclair: ?
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Just that decision in the women's world cup - but more generally everything is a peno now
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Everything is offside
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Can't celebrate goals when they happen so no drama
07/07/2019, 17:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Its fucking with everyone's sense of what's a goal or not
07/07/2019, 17:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Cant celebrate
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Yeah. Kills it as a spectacle
07/07/2019, 17:38 - David;: Fans don't know what's happening
07/07/2019, 17:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Arbitrary marginal offside aswell
07/07/2019, 17:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Morally onside
07/07/2019, 17:40 - Hamish Sinclair: They should make offside easier for attackers. Make it so that that any overlap between players equals onsode
07/07/2019, 17:40 - David;: They made a good point in guardian weekly that they are not paying same attention to when ball is struck to where striker is. One frame can make a difference, and when is the 'pass' played? Wasn't meant to be this precise.
07/07/2019, 17:41 - David;: Yeah
07/07/2019, 17:41 - David;: Because also offside is designed to prevent goal hanging not to give huge advantage to defenders
07/07/2019, 17:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Would probably stop any side from playing a high line ever though
07/07/2019, 17:42 - David;: Makes the offside trap too easy to play now it's refereed like this
07/07/2019, 17:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, now just punishes clever movement
07/07/2019, 17:43 - Hamish Sinclair: VAR would have ruined the career of fox in the box types - inzaghi, solskjaer etc
07/07/2019, 17:43 - David;: Also this thing of any handball in the box no matter how close or inadvertant or close to the body is a penno
07/07/2019, 17:44 - David;: Maybe need a form of punishment less severe like an indirect free kick in the box
07/07/2019, 17:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Differentiate between accidental and not
07/07/2019, 17:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah that would work, indirect freekick would still be dangerous but not on ssme level as a pen
07/07/2019, 17:46 - David;: Also I think there should be something like a challenge system for checking, because seems arbitrary when refs do or do not consult it
07/07/2019, 17:46 - David;: And to keep checks to a mimimum
07/07/2019, 17:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, stops all decisions around the box being subject to such intense scrutiny
07/07/2019, 17:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Although teams would always just throw in a challenge whenever you concede a goal, and then how far back do you go?
07/07/2019, 17:49 - David;: Otherwise basically every corner we need to stop and run over and review footage for any holding, shirt pulling, blocking etc.
07/07/2019, 17:49 - David;: Have to say what you think was wrong
07/07/2019, 17:49 - David;: I.e. 'im challenging - number 7 was offside'
07/07/2019, 17:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Or the ref has to initiate the decision to go to VAR, therefore allowing people to get away with low levels of holding etc
07/07/2019, 17:57 - David;: Going to be a lot more set piece goals this season I guess
07/07/2019, 17:57 - David;: Because defenders will be scared of being to physical so will be easier to find space in the box
07/07/2019, 17:57 - David;: Maybe this is what triggers the return of 4-4-2
07/07/2019, 17:58 - David;: Would be somewhat ironic
07/07/2019, 17:58 - David;: Sends us back to the dark ages
07/07/2019, 17:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Both teams just humping it into the box, rolling the VAR dice
07/07/2019, 17:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Would probably improve English chances in Europe though, play to our steghtnhs
07/07/2019, 18:00 - David;: Although just as we've all abandoned that style of football
07/07/2019, 18:00 - David;: It will somehow work against us
07/07/2019, 21:20 - Damian Rumble: I think part of the problem is that the very culture of football is about pushing the rules to absolute limit and beyond when ever you can. The current rules are very hard to enforced to the letter by the refs in real time and because everyone is doing it a large number of offences are allowed to pass. VAR ends that by allowing proper scrutiny and the result is a very stop start game where players who are routinely cheating are getting caught when previously they wouldn't have. I think the rules need to change to reflect this but so does the culture of football - the accidental handball in the penalty area is a good example of this. At the end of the day playing competitively and fairly without gamesmanship is preferable to old way that drives an 'do anything to win' attitude and fuels widespread disdain for the officials.
07/07/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: Not true of all offensives though. Offsides are as hard to judge as a player as by a ref, you're not cheating by being offside
07/07/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: Handballs too, very rare for them to be really clearcut and deliberate
07/07/2019, 21:27 - Rob;: Diving's probably the only thing, and that doesn't seem to have actually come up that much in var matches
07/07/2019, 21:46 - Sam;: Can everyone do me a favour and delete that video of me?
07/07/2019, 22:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes
07/07/2019, 22:20 - Stefan;: Yep

07/07/2019, 22:28 - Sam;: Yeah that’s fine lol
07/07/2019, 22:29 - David;: He could have just had a really big curry in that one
07/07/2019, 22:30 - Rob;: I got big curried at Glasto
07/07/2019, 22:31 - Rob;: Reduced my mdma trip to 10 mild minutes spent walking through a crowd, about two hours late
07/07/2019, 22:35 - David;: So this is an established effect
07/07/2019, 22:59 - Rob;: It was actually a pie, but Damo and I came to call it the big curry
07/07/2019, 23:43 - Damian Rumble: Yeah. Smashed some before chemical brothers and felt nothing for the whole set. Obviously I then topped up and I was thoroughly blooted when things finally caught up
07/07/2019, 23:45 - Stefan;: The physics is you need loads of drugs to break through the wall of curry, but when the damn finally breaks it hits all at once

11/07/2019, 10:56 - Phill: One of the directors just slides his chair over to me and asks if I wanted to head a funny story
11/07/2019, 10:57 - Phill: He said when his mate was at uni in Bristol he was out looking for a shag and found some rotter. He was doing her doggy but she wasn't moving or making a sound so he tried to feed it into her arsehole
11/07/2019, 10:57 - Phill: She turned her head round and in a thick Somerset accent goes "changing lanes, fair play. Shoot it in my pooper, I don't want no babber"

11/07/2019, 11:41 - Rob;: But seems quite an aggressive move by your longest serving player and captain
11/07/2019, 11:42 - Rob;: Why wouldn't we want a fee. Madness
11/07/2019, 11:42 - David;: Is contract up this summer?

11/07/2019, 11:44 - David;: Ah. Well he can just fuck of and rot then
11/07/2019, 11:45 - Rob;: I'd probably sell koscielny at this point. Has been brilliant, but he's old and knackered
11/07/2019, 11:45 - David;: But a bonce in the box
11/07/2019, 11:45 - David;: That's always useful
11/07/2019, 11:46 - Rob;: Yeah, but wonder if a young player who's available all the time would be more useful than a veteran who can't do two games a week

12/07/2019, 16:33 - Phill: Yeet
12/07/2019, 16:34 - David;: Tolkein wrote the hobbit. The editor dumbed it down and stuck quite a stupid headline on it that made it seem like a partisan dig at the tories when actually it was about 20 years of policy under both governments. But whatever.

These were the sorts of insights that didn't seem to be coming from other elite players. The fact that former Spurs full-back Benoit Assou-Ekotto would turn up for every match with a Tesco bag containing the same four luncheon items: a croissant, a hot chocolate, a full-fat Coke and a packet of crisps.

23/07/2019, 14:21 - Damian Rumble: In a park eating my lunch, listening to a conversation next to me between a attractive lady in her late 30s and an elderly Indian man, I over hear the following extract from her.... "My first love was really intense. I was 19. He was 40 with a wife and kids. I remember he came to visit me in the shop I was working in. We were chatting when this random person came in and dropped a black bin bag on the counter. He said, "guys this is a bag of coke. I want you to keep. I'm in a lot of trouble with the police and I need to flee the country.". Well obviously we kept it. We talked about being responsible with it but we ended up getting out at all occasions. I hosted big parties. Snorting it all the time. Sucking it off his cock. It was really bad. We got into alot of arguements during that time. Like, physical fighting. I can't believe how violent I was back then! Anyway, he got into some issues with child support and had to move back in with his wife. He still messages from time to time. I should go see him again at some point... "

25/07/2019, 13:13 - David;: Just heard someone use 'close' in it's proper context. I'd forgotten it had an actual meaning and that normal people don't apply it arbitrarily to anything
25/07/2019, 13:13 - David;: It is a very close day
25/07/2019, 13:15 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm on the underground melting
25/07/2019, 13:17 - David;: The Johnson purge adds to the post-apocalyptic vibe as well

25/07/2019, 13:23 - Rob;: Being near a busy road for a minute was horrible, but in the park it basically feels like you're in Milan
25/07/2019, 13:27 - / James Ball: Don't worry there's a golden age coming apparently. You know, akin to the rennaisance or the enlightenment or something.
25/07/2019, 14:08 - Damian Rumble: We have our office sports day today. Many people not happy about being forced to go outside and do exercise. The company declared an 'extreme weather event' and allowed alot of people to work from home

25/07/2019, 18:34 - Phill: Sauna and plunge pool great idea tho
25/07/2019, 19:14 - David;: Yeah I'm pushing so hard for the Sauna room
25/07/2019, 19:17 - Phill: Yeah the sauna room would be GOAT
25/07/2019, 19:17 - Sam;: Making cabin style beds above the living room looks great. The frousting potential on having a wooden borrow to grot down into when I’m off my nut
25/07/2019, 19:34 - Paul;: Agree on this
25/07/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: Yeah the interior doesn't need too much. Running water (assume that's happening to supply sauna) would make a world of difference
25/07/2019, 19:38 - Phill: This already exists. No change needed. Boycott the change.
25/07/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: Should level the site and tarmac it. Build multi-storey parking at the top
25/07/2019, 19:47 - Sam;: It doesn’t already exist. There’s a couple of mattresses on the floor and a couple of unnecessarily raised single beds. That room could be a glorious froust chamber. Glorious
25/07/2019, 19:53 - Rob;: Making sound carry less between the attic and the living room would be big
25/07/2019, 19:58 - Paul;: Fake news
25/07/2019, 20:04 - Phill: No. Part of the grot is being able to hear people trippinf whilst blooted. Keeps you tethered.
25/07/2019, 20:05 - Paul;: You should have a vomitorium in the barn
25/07/2019, 20:05 - Paul;: Create maximum grot

29/07/2019, 23:38 - David;: Are you referring to the highest scoring Englishman in football?
30/07/2019, 08:05 - Sam;: What level?
30/07/2019, 10:56 - Paul;: He plays in the premier league
30/07/2019, 10:59 - David;: On 1 January 2019, Sharp scored his 220th goal and became the leading English born goalscorer in English professional football during the 21st century so far
30/07/2019, 10:59 - David;: So just all professional football
30/07/2019, 11:00 - Rob;: More goals than Bardsley's had bylines
30/07/2019, 11:27 - David;: Tricky Billy
30/07/2019, 11:27 - David;: Sharp Shooter
30/07/2019, 11:27 - David;: Gary goals
30/07/2019, 11:42 - Sam;: Championship and below..
30/07/2019, 11:42 - Sam;: He’s no Steve Bull
30/07/2019, 15:13 - Rob;: So Wales
30/07/2019, 15:13 - Rob;: Am I right in saying Stefan and Damo aren't coming this time?
30/07/2019, 15:13 - Rob;: What days are other people going?
30/07/2019, 15:14 - Phill: Will head up after work Friday night and leave Monday
30/07/2019, 15:14 - Jack G;: I was planning on driving down early on the Friday morning. Probably heading back on Monday
30/07/2019, 15:15 - Paul;: Heading up early Friday I think
30/07/2019, 15:16 - Stefan;: Yeah I'll be in Chicago
30/07/2019, 15:17 - David;: I'm taking a day off and going Friday morning - but driving from Edinburgh so probably be there after lunch time
30/07/2019, 15:17 - David;: Then yeah back Monday I guess
30/07/2019, 15:17 - Rob;: Paul could I possibly come down with you? I'll see if o can have that Friday off now
30/07/2019, 15:18 - Paul;: Yeah

31/07/2019, 21:35 - Phill: Olive. Extra virgin olive. Red wine vinegar. Old wine. Soy. Balsamic.
31/07/2019, 21:36 - David;: 4/6
31/07/2019, 21:36 - Phill: Fish?
31/07/2019, 21:37 - David;: Missed out Lea and perrins. A left field decanting choice but had one spare
31/07/2019, 21:37 - David;: And sesame oil instead of the red wine
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: I like the idea of having good liquid infrastructure, but most of those things do already come in bottles of that size
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: What's decanting gaining here?
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Sam;: Those tops though. Such pour control
31/07/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: Yeah, like that
31/07/2019, 21:41 - Phill: Keith.
31/07/2019, 21:41 - Rob;: I'll agree for oils
31/07/2019, 21:41 - Rob;: Lea and Perrin's no needing to be poured any faster than it's original bottle dispenses it
31/07/2019, 21:44 - Phill: If you store it in those bottles it provides low level oxidisation which mellows the flavour but reduces shelf. Better for subtle flavouring of dishes opposed to the intense vinegaryness.
31/07/2019, 21:44 - Phill: Shelf life.
31/07/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: I see
31/07/2019, 21:46 - Paul;: Dave, can you confirm how fast this causes your l&p to pour?
31/07/2019, 22:02 - David;: It provides a smoother pour
31/07/2019, 22:02 - David;: Never been a fan of the pour speed of the native lea and perrins bottle
31/07/2019, 22:04 - David;: Plus the clean aesthetics
31/07/2019, 22:06 - David;: No labels. Just pure liquid.
31/07/2019, 22:07 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. Cutting down on branding in the home
31/07/2019, 22:11 - David;: When I have lea and perrins, I have loads of lea and perrins.

31/07/2019, 22:19 - David;: I'm rinsing the L&P these days. Tomato juice.
31/07/2019, 22:20 - David;: Plus a staple for chillis to add sweetness.
31/07/2019, 22:21 - Paul;: Break out a chilli in wales. Want to try the ones you’ve been making
31/07/2019, 22:21 - Paul;: Could have a few different batches
31/07/2019, 22:21 - Paul;: Different heats
31/07/2019, 22:21 - David;: I've refined it now. Impssible to improve.

31/07/2019, 23:27 - David;: Maybe that's how it works. Creates complacency
01/08/2019, 07:43 - Rob;: You could use him when you've set a huge run target and the other team are just digging in trying not to get out
01/08/2019, 07:44 - Paul;: Equally you could use someone good
01/08/2019, 07:44 - Rob;: Let them have their sixes and catch them out

01/08/2019, 13:15 - Rob;: The tail/penis is worrying
01/08/2019, 14:21 - David;: Bowling
01/08/2019, 15:13 - / James Ball: 129-8 is an impressively bad opener from them
01/08/2019, 15:14 - / James Ball: Still plenty of time for England to collapse in a very traditional way
01/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Yeah yeah, we  can easily fuck this up.
01/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Hubris. Predicting a sub-100 score for us
01/08/2019, 15:48 - Jack G;: Australia to sneak up to 200, we’ll be 70-4 by lunch tomorrow
01/08/2019, 15:55 - David;: This is classic. A big 9th wicket partnership

01/08/2019, 16:21 - David;: Inter Miami. Very shit.
01/08/2019, 16:41 - Sam;: Like he’s just creating his own fifa team to play with
01/08/2019, 16:47 - David;: Is the inter still short for the Italian word, or do they think that it's a generic team name like albion or athletic?
01/08/2019, 16:50 - Sam;: That’s my assumption too. It’s sound fancy therefore it’s fine. Inter Milan have it mate
01/08/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Miami Caledonian Thistle
01/08/2019, 16:54 - David;: Bayern Miami
01/08/2019, 16:57 - / James Ball: Bourissa Inter Miami Thistle City United
01/08/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Bayer Leverkusen will always get me, that there's a brand that sponsors a foorball team that has an almost identical name to another football team's name
01/08/2019, 16:58 - Rob;: Like having Wigan Athleti, with Athleti being a tyre company
01/08/2019, 16:58 - David;: Would be good if Beckham had used Bayer  without getting any sponsorship from them
01/08/2019, 16:59 - David;: Just thought it was a sophisticated word. Bayer Miami. No financial relationship between them
01/08/2019, 17:00 - / James Ball: Bayer literally means Bavarian in german
01/08/2019, 17:01 - / James Ball: The Bavarian Miami
01/08/2019, 17:01 - / James Ball: Huge sizzling bratwursts on the beach
01/08/2019, 17:01 - David;: Red Bull Miami. 'I assumed from red bull Saltzburg that red bull was a German term for football team'
01/08/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: But the name in this case comes from the pharmaceutical company based in Leverkusen
01/08/2019, 17:02 - David;: but is the company itself named after the place?
01/08/2019, 17:02 - / James Ball: Bayerin would be a female Bavarian
01/08/2019, 17:03 - David;: What's the difference Bayer vs Bayern then?
01/08/2019, 17:03 - / James Ball: Bayern means Bavaria
01/08/2019, 17:03 - David;: Yeah but Bayer
01/08/2019, 17:04 - / James Ball: Ich bin Bayer ich komme aus Bayern. Ich spiele immer Fußball.
01/08/2019, 17:05 - Rob;: Bayer = Bavarian
Bayern = Bavaria
01/08/2019, 17:05 - Rob;: So it's not really a coincidence
01/08/2019, 17:06 - Rob;: Bayer tradmarked the word heroin
01/08/2019, 17:07 - David;: CSKA Miami
01/08/2019, 17:08 - Rob;: Best know product, aspirin, the active ingredient of which was discovered by Edward Stone as he chewed on some willow bark in a meadow just outside of Chipping Norton
01/08/2019, 17:10 - / James Ball: Salaclyic acid
01/08/2019, 18:03 - David;: And that's cruffts
01/08/2019, 18:04 - Jack G;: Shocking umpiring today
01/08/2019, 18:14 - Jack G;: Rob, how is your Pepe?
01/08/2019, 18:23 - David;: What does that even mean?
01/08/2019, 18:24 - Jack G;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/49197553
01/08/2019, 18:24 - David;: How is your pepe?
01/08/2019, 18:24 - Rob;: Yeah, the phrasing there is hard to penetrate
01/08/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: I am very happy to have signed a wide player, and a very good one at that
01/08/2019, 18:25 - Rob;: Wide attack being the best form of defence of course
01/08/2019, 18:25 - David;: Yeah because your problem has always been a lack of mercurial forwards
01/08/2019, 18:26 - Rob;: But width, in desperate need of width
01/08/2019, 18:26 - David;: Feel you could have a season like our early Klopp years
01/08/2019, 18:26 - David;: Madcap 4-4s everywhere
01/08/2019, 18:27 - Rob;: We really need the Klopp season where we sign Virgil van Dyke
01/08/2019, 18:27 - David;: You have to earn that Rob
01/08/2019, 18:27 - Jack G;: A more direct winger would definitely help your away form though, which is your main issue
01/08/2019, 18:28 - David;: You have to endure a season of conceding at every corner and Karius spilling 50% of shots
01/08/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Perhaps Saliba next season will be our defensive panacea
01/08/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Good to pin huge hopes on that
01/08/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: If we ship out Mustafi and get a good centre half in this week, and maybe Tierney too, I'll be happy
01/08/2019, 18:29 - David;: Is Koscielny just dead to Emery now
01/08/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Emery said he'd play him if he wants to stay
01/08/2019, 18:30 - David;: Good to base your defence on a disgruntled veteran and a 19 year old
01/08/2019, 18:30 - Rob;: He's going, pretty sure
01/08/2019, 18:32 - Rob;: Leaves Sokratis (fine), Holding (Good, but returning from big injury), Mustafi (human chaos), Chambers (who knows at this point) and Monreal (good, but old and needed at LB unless Tierney comes)
01/08/2019, 18:32 - Rob;: Which is not terribly convincing at all
01/08/2019, 18:56 - Paul;: How’s your Pepe
01/08/2019, 19:34 - David;: We're you thinking how's your day. Like 'hope you have a great Pepe'
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Jack G;: How’s your father, how’s your Pepe
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: How's your father?
How's your papa?
How's your Pepe?
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: Haha
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Jack G;: Lol
01/08/2019, 19:36 - Rob;: Got it!
01/08/2019, 19:37 - Rob;: Jack you've got to admit it's a leap
01/08/2019, 19:38 - Jack G;: I thought Pepe had language connotations to father
01/08/2019, 19:39 - Jack G;: Made sense in my head, oh well probably a 4/10 “pun” will try harder
01/08/2019, 19:40 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/08/2019, 19:40 - Rob;: Lol
01/08/2019, 19:41 - Rob;: Ah yeah, Pepe, as in pater putativus
01/08/2019, 19:53 - Paul;: This dam wall collapsing then
01/08/2019, 19:59 - David;: Lol
01/08/2019, 19:59 - David;: Alpha Pepe
01/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: Obviously
01/08/2019, 20:02 - Rob;: Stay
01/08/2019, 20:14 - Jack G;: Ah not far from me, could be disaster
01/08/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: Turns the tap on in your 8th floor flat and gets swept away
01/08/2019, 20:16 - Jack G;: Could send a load of water down the Mersey river, would write off Stockport for a bit
01/08/2019, 20:16 - David;: Do we need Stockport?
01/08/2019, 20:17 - Jack G;: Any train coming from south into Manchester goes through Stockport
01/08/2019, 20:17 - Jack G;: But Stockport itself, not much of a loss
01/08/2019, 20:28 - Rob;: It's it only only to flood Whalley Bridge though?
01/08/2019, 20:28 - Rob;: Which is a bit smaller than Chippy
01/08/2019, 20:29 - Jack G;: Depends if the dam fails or not
01/08/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/08/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: Could swim that
01/08/2019, 20:37 - Jack G;: Hopefully stays that way, getting loads of warnings
01/08/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: Ride the wave down
01/08/2019, 20:39 - Jack G;: This time last year we had no rain for a month and wildfires on Saddleworth Moor
01/08/2019, 20:44 - David;: How have you moved to the one place in the country undergoing a biblical apocalypse?
01/08/2019, 20:45 - David;: 'we had a terrible locust plague in Salford a few weeks back'
01/08/2019, 20:46 - Jack G;: I’m far enough away to not be effected, can just watch the fallout.
01/08/2019, 20:48 - David;: How psyched are you for the Northern powerhouse?
01/08/2019, 20:51 - Jack G;: Doubt much will change - what will reducing journey time from Manchester to Leeds really do? Need the jobs not the trains
01/08/2019, 20:57 - Paul;: Lol
01/08/2019, 20:58 - Rob;: Might be nice for Leeds though
01/08/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: And opens up those new channel 4 jobs to Manchester, which won't be new any more by the time the trains are running
01/08/2019, 20:59 - Phill: Train drivers.

02/08/2019, 07:05 - Rob;: 14% swing from Conservative to Lib Dem in Brecon & Radnorshire
02/08/2019, 07:07 - Rob;: Well, votes might have come from Labour and elsewhere, but they made up 9,500 votes in a constituency of less than 70k. That's quite a big swing
02/08/2019, 07:08 - Jack G;: Boris now with a majority of 1
02/08/2019, 07:08 - Rob;: Yeah
02/08/2019, 07:08 - Rob;: Which includes all the people he just sacked
02/08/2019, 08:02 - Stefan;: I think most of the LibDem gains are from Labour and most of the Tories' losses were to Brexit party
02/08/2019, 08:03 - Stefan;: Also the margin was 1,400 - they probably wouldn't have won if the Greens and Plaid Cymru hadn't stepped aside
02/08/2019, 08:06 - Damian Rumble: A great result but I think we might lose that if there was a GE tomorrow. If the brexit party step aside then the Tories would have won for sure
02/08/2019, 08:07 - Damian Rumble: Still one defection/abstention away from defeating the Tories
02/08/2019, 08:08 - Damian Rumble: That's all us and none of labour
02/08/2019, 08:11 - Hamish Sinclair: That slightly overlooks labour's result at the last election
02/08/2019, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Labour being the reason there was a hing parliament in the first place
02/08/2019, 08:15 - Rob;: Also, depending on what the votes on, can you count on labour voting against the Tories?
02/08/2019, 08:57 - Sam;: A hing parliament, a hibbed parliament
02/08/2019, 10:20 - David;: You have 13 seats

02/08/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Where will Chelsea get their goals this season?
02/08/2019, 11:51 - Rob;: Only Giroud and Batshuyi classified as forwards on Fantasy
02/08/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: Unable to sign players
02/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Lol, what was he chairman of?
02/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Abraham as well?
02/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: They could probably convert Pedro and/or Willian to false 9s at a stretch
02/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: I'm just leaving Chelsea well alone until we have any info on Lampard's line up
02/08/2019, 12:17 - Rob;: Chelsea fan at works predicts Abraham and Giroud rotating
02/08/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: Yeah, I'm probably going to steer clear, but I do think they'll end up have good value players - no one in the squad costs more than 7.5
02/08/2019, 12:21 - David;: Agreed, just impossible to predict which until we have more data
02/08/2019, 12:21 - David;: I think Pulisic will be good but a he's adjusting to the prem and not sure he will start from day 1
02/08/2019, 12:23 - David;: Probs going to be something like front 3 of Pulisic, Giroud, Willian in front of Barkley, Kovacic, Jorginho? Or a mount/loftus-cheek thrown in there.
02/08/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: His Pulisic and assist man? His goal stats don't look so hot
02/08/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: Sounds plausible
02/08/2019, 12:24 - Rob;: Chelsea fan I spoke to is buying bonds in Barkley
02/08/2019, 12:24 - David;: I considered Barkley bonds.
02/08/2019, 12:25 - Rob;: I can actually upgrade my bench midfielder into him with the 1.5m I have spare, which seems logical
02/08/2019, 12:25 - David;: Does assists, but also been scoring in pre-season
02/08/2019, 12:26 - David;: Barkley's Premier League
02/08/2019, 12:35 - Paul;: All I’m hearing on the wires is Barkley
02/08/2019, 12:40 - David;: On the forums
02/08/2019, 12:40 - David;: The bovine
02/08/2019, 12:43 - Rob;: Radio Barkley
02/08/2019, 12:43 - Rob;: Radio Mane
02/08/2019, 15:01 - David;: Sam what will Man United line-up be first day of the seasy?
02/08/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: Couldn't possibly mess up the cricket from here
02/08/2019, 15:19 - Jack G;: Instantly lose a wicket. Cheers Rob
02/08/2019, 15:29 - Paul;: Yeah thanks rob you cunt
02/08/2019, 15:39 - David;: Fuck sake rob
02/08/2019, 15:41 - David;: Maguire then
02/08/2019, 15:41 - David;: Slabhead to old toilet
02/08/2019, 15:41 - Jack G;: £80 million, football has gone even more mad
02/08/2019, 15:42 - David;: £80 buys you a slabhead
02/08/2019, 15:42 - Jack G;: Can dijk, de ligt, koulibaly all probably cheaper
02/08/2019, 15:43 - Jack G;: Leicester laughing to the bank
02/08/2019, 15:43 - David;: But think of the sheer wall of forehead if they play Maguire and Jones
02/08/2019, 15:44 - Jack G;: Gurn central
02/08/2019, 16:40 - Damian Rumble: Is Dunk going to Leicester now?
02/08/2019, 16:48 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
02/08/2019, 16:48 - Rob;: The girls are ultimately key
02/08/2019, 16:49 - Rob;: The way she's brushing her hair back, absolutely vital
02/08/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: The presence of the other two, and how Maguire is ignoring them are underrated contributions
02/08/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: But I think the biggest contribution is the main girl's initial basic attractiveness, which dissolves on close inspection
02/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: The unabashed body language big Maguire
02/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: That's what United have paid 80 million for
02/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: The post-anecdote timing
02/08/2019, 16:53 - Rob;: 9/10 meme

02/08/2019, 17:37 - Stefan;: Been there, it's incredible
02/08/2019, 17:37 - Stefan;: People base jump off it
02/08/2019, 18:08 - Jack G;: This crowd at Edgbaston is great
03/08/2019, 10:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Stefan are you coming to pride again this year?
03/08/2019, 10:17 - Stefan;: Yep, got the same house as last year
03/08/2019, 10:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Presume you're seeing kylie?
03/08/2019, 10:33 - Stefan;: That's a very safe presumption
03/08/2019, 23:01 - Sam;: If I opened a pub: The Postman’s Sack.
03/08/2019, 23:49 - David;: The miners shaft?
04/08/2019, 00:32 - Sam;: Yeah y
04/08/2019, 12:00 - David;: Moise to Everton
04/08/2019, 12:00 - David;: Hib
04/08/2019, 12:28 - Phill: That's a great signing for them.
04/08/2019, 15:50 - Sam;: Why are city not wearing any sponsorships on their shirt?
04/08/2019, 15:51 - David;: Because they are bell ends
05/08/2019, 10:46 - Paul;: Rob, have you bought the away shirt yet?
05/08/2019, 10:51 - Rob;: No
05/08/2019, 20:38 - Phill: All this cum over Maguire is embarrassing. He's a mid-tier defender at best.
05/08/2019, 21:24 - Jack G;: https://youtu.be/AnvHx4GWyvY
05/08/2019, 21:24 - Jack G;: Got to be better than that though
06/08/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: Sam how did your estate agent reply to you 'we asked for a month-to-month contract at the same price, is this a joke?' email?
06/08/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: Pops into my head every so often
06/08/2019, 13:58 - David;: Phil make an FF team, then Jules Chippet complete.
06/08/2019, 13:59 - Phill: Yeah will do this evening
06/08/2019, 13:59 - David;: Would also like closure on this
06/08/2019, 14:30 - David;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvelous_Nakamba
06/08/2019, 16:24 - Sam;: Lol. They admitted they shouldn’t have offered monthly rolling as the landlord was not on board with it.

I got a comprise of a break clause ‘Window’ of 2 months, which starts after 6 months.
07/08/2019, 12:37 - David;: Koscielny ded. Jenkinson ded.
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Sam;: David luiz to Arsenal?
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: Yeah
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: Possibly
07/08/2019, 17:25 - Jack G;: Elneny, Guendouzi, Luiz. I see a pattern
07/08/2019, 17:26 - Rob;: Feel like we're getting a tramp's boots to go with our brand new tuxedo jacket
07/08/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: Eleneny got a haircut actually
07/08/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: And will probably leave
07/08/2019, 17:39 - David;: Should get Fellaini as well
07/08/2019, 17:42 - Sam;: He’s also cut his hair...
07/08/2019, 17:55 - Jack G;: Surely Luiz is an upgrade on Mustafi though? Could do a job this season until Saliba comes in next season?
07/08/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: He's probably a shade better
07/08/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: It would have just been nice of we could have made centre half the priority this summer
07/08/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: Not doing so undermines good purchases elsewhere
07/08/2019, 17:58 - Jack G;: Sure but prices for CB are massively inflated atm so wouldn’t leave money for anything else. Surely next summer you can spend you’re whole budget on a great CB as you won’t have many holes left in the squad
07/08/2019, 17:59 - Paul;: Haven’t arsenal always been saying this and always have a terrible defence?
07/08/2019, 18:03 - David;: How's your pepe
07/08/2019, 18:11 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/08/2019, 18:20 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/08/2019, 18:31 - Paul;: 4th fc
07/08/2019, 18:35 - Phill: >tardigrades
07/08/2019, 18:43 - David;: Yeah >tardigrades
07/08/2019, 21:14 - Phill: Sambo both your teams have spent over £100m
08/08/2019, 11:18 - David;: Lukaku ded
08/08/2019, 11:19 - Rob;: About to downgrade into ancient relic Mandzukic?
08/08/2019, 11:19 - Rob;: A crumbling old man
08/08/2019, 11:19 - David;: Headline just says inter though - didn't specify inter Milan or inter Miami
08/08/2019, 11:20 - David;: Makes no sense. I though their whole strategy was to stop buying aging husks.
08/08/2019, 11:21 - Rob;: I like how Juve have ruined lives by suddenly deciding they won't sell Dybala with 6 hrs to go
08/08/2019, 11:22 - David;: Never bought into the idea Tottenham would get him anyway
08/08/2019, 11:22 - Rob;: United might have though
08/08/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: I would like Eriksen to move abroad for no money after the prem window shuts
08/08/2019, 11:54 - David;: When's his contract up?
08/08/2019, 11:54 - David;: So you've gained a wild Luiz.
08/08/2019, 11:55 - David;: Right in the heart of your defence.
08/08/2019, 11:55 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
08/08/2019, 11:55 - Rob;: Fighting fire with fire
08/08/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: Next summer. I didn't mean literally no money, it will just be a lot less now
08/08/2019, 11:58 - David;: I've always said what i value most in a central defender is unpredictability, flair and set pieces
08/08/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: And shithouse aggression, important in the season they introduce VAR
08/08/2019, 12:07 - David;: Will teams like Burnley just be fucked now? Unable to defend corners by just quietly elbowing and jostling people.
08/08/2019, 12:09 - Rob;: I mean it hasn't been used for that sort of thing that much
08/08/2019, 12:09 - Rob;: More insane accidental handballs
08/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: If Emil Krafth has a man of the match performance, could have the headline 'Krafth Work'.
08/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: The world cup though. All those pennos Kane got.
08/08/2019, 12:12 - Jack G;: I wonder why no teams have adopted that single file lineup at set piece strategy that Gareth Southgate perfected
08/08/2019, 12:15 - David;: Zidane's handling of the Bale situation puts me in mind of Phil's approach to Football Manager 09, when he insisted on making Torres rot on the bench.
08/08/2019, 12:15 - David;: Such a reckless way to squander your prime asset
08/08/2019, 12:49 - Phill: New guy at works unlce owns Sunderland FC. He's telling us about the Netflix documentary.
08/08/2019, 13:17 - Jack G;: Andy Carroll back to Newcastle - oh dear Mike Ashley
08/08/2019, 13:23 - David;: Could be good, his boyhood club.
08/08/2019, 13:25 - Jack G;: How can he pass the medical though?

08/08/2019, 17:39 - Phill: A poor man's Robbo
08/08/2019, 17:41 - Rob;: He actually cost a lot more, so a rich man's Robbo mor accurate
08/08/2019, 17:42 - Rob;: I like the look of him. Imagine his defensive ability and fitness record will be immediately tainted by signing though
08/08/2019, 17:44 - Rob;: Looks like we might be getting £40m for Iwobi 🤔
08/08/2019, 18:49 - David;: So Everton. Front 3 Iwobi, Moise, Richarlison in front of Siggurdson
08/08/2019, 18:49 - David;: Not bad
08/08/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Yeah it's an ok mix of pace, power and skill
08/08/2019, 18:56 - Jack G;: The battle for 7th-10th is going to be intense
08/08/2019, 19:32 - David;: Not a great week for Cenk Tosun
08/08/2019, 19:41 - David;: The anticipation. New Seasy

09/08/2019, 10:42 - David;: No Maupay?
09/08/2019, 10:43 - Rob;: I have no idea
09/08/2019, 10:43 - Rob;: Perhaps one part of a scrolling message?
09/08/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Jack, talk to me about West Ham's defenders
09/08/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: Who do you think will start?
09/08/2019, 10:58 - Jack G;: Masuaku Balbuena Diop Fredericks
09/08/2019, 10:58 - Jack G;: Fredericks and Masuaku both very attaching so best to go for them over either CB
09/08/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: Good to know
09/08/2019, 10:59 - David;: Cresswell?
09/08/2019, 10:59 - Rob;: You have a decent run of fixtures week 2 onwards
09/08/2019, 10:59 - Paul;: Rob, what’s your team?
09/08/2019, 11:00 - Jack G;: He’ll rotate with Masuaku so Fredericks is the safer option for fantasy football
09/08/2019, 11:01 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
09/08/2019, 11:02 - Rob;: Kelly scares me because he's in 24% of teams, so big potential for him to drop in value if he doesn't start. Then you can't buy anyone with 3.9
09/08/2019, 11:02 - David;: Old pumping Billy on the bench, I've done the same
09/08/2019, 11:02 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
09/08/2019, 11:03 - Rob;: Always a place for the highest scoring Englishman on my bench
09/08/2019, 11:03 - David;: Better than Kane
09/08/2019, 11:03 - David;: More goals.
09/08/2019, 11:04 - David;: Surprised you're not starting him
09/08/2019, 11:04 - Jack G;: King Kane
09/08/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: If I could sell Kane and have two Billys I would
09/08/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: Price drops for Kane and Salah this season seem like freebies
09/08/2019, 11:04 - David;: Gary goals
09/08/2019, 11:05 - Rob;: The Sharp shooter
09/08/2019, 11:05 - David;: Big exposure to the everton defence?
09/08/2019, 11:06 - Paul;: And you all laughed at digne
09/08/2019, 11:06 - David;: First they came for the trade unionists
09/08/2019, 11:06 - Paul;: Come crawling back into the digne fold
09/08/2019, 11:07 - Jack G;: Still got Drossard in your team Paul?
09/08/2019, 11:07 - Paul;: Barkley
09/08/2019, 11:07 - David;: First name on my team sheet
09/08/2019, 11:08 - Rob;: I imagine swapping keeper in the first few weeks, but I think Everton's good fixtures might help
09/08/2019, 11:09 - Paul;: Jack let’s see your team
09/08/2019, 11:10 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
09/08/2019, 11:13 - David;: Is Ozil still a thing?
09/08/2019, 11:13 - Rob;: I think at 7m there's a chance Ozil could become good value
09/08/2019, 11:13 - Rob;: But he could end up being in and out again
09/08/2019, 11:13 - Rob;: Wait and see I think
09/08/2019, 11:14 - Jack G;: He should play against Newcastle though I imagine?
09/08/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: He has never played Newcastle away
09/08/2019, 11:14 - David;: Lol
09/08/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: Not 100% he'll start.
09/08/2019, 11:15 - David;: How did you have that info straight to hand
09/08/2019, 11:15 - David;: Starts of every arsenal player vs every premier league opponent. Rain man rob.
09/08/2019, 11:16 - Rob;: It was in a season preview I read; someone else did the groundwork for me
09/08/2019, 11:16 - David;: How many times has Moreal started at home to Bournemouth?
09/08/2019, 11:17 - Rob;: The writer was pointing out how few away games he's started while at Arsenal
09/08/2019, 11:23 - David;: Nice that Iwobi played exactly 100 league games for you. Keeps his wikipedia record nice and clean
09/08/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 11:23 - David;: Needs to always work in 100 multiples through his career
09/08/2019, 11:23 - David;: would have been better if he'd scored 10 not 11 goals
09/08/2019, 11:24 - Rob;: Sort of wish we could have shifted Mhki instead, Iwobi's workrate, pace and dribbling are nice assets to have in the squad, but we got a good price
09/08/2019, 11:25 - Rob;: More useful assets than languid ineffectivity
09/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: Yeah he's been shit
09/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: That deal cursed all involved
09/08/2019, 11:26 - Rob;: Yeah. Definitely a curse
09/08/2019, 11:27 - Rob;: Neither can live while the other survives
09/08/2019, 11:27 - Jack G;: Both a massive plague on the wage bill as well
09/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 11:30 - Rob;: Raul Sanllehi and Edu seem quite astute and proactive. Hoping the overpaying of ineffective midfielders dies with fucking Gazides
09/08/2019, 11:31 - Jack G;: Gazidis - the bald fraud
09/08/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: Good luck to AC Milan
09/08/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: He was such a classic marketing dickhead
09/08/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Um HELLO, United Vs Chelsea
09/08/2019, 12:52 - David;: yeah yeah
09/08/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: This particular weekend
09/08/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: The return of everything right in the world
09/08/2019, 12:53 - David;: Finding it difficult to get work done. Too distracted
09/08/2019, 12:53 - David;: Remember the days when we would have been planning this for weeks. Would have based an entire weekend of frousting around it.
09/08/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: We're in a lull having just finished an issue. I'm not even pretending to work
09/08/2019, 12:54 - Rob;: Yeah. We should get that back one season
09/08/2019, 12:55 - David;: We would have been simultanesously playing football manager and watching actual management. Absorbing football through real and virtual media.
09/08/2019, 12:56 - David;: Spurs villa should be an interesting game as well
09/08/2019, 12:56 - Rob;: One of the few occasions I'll support villa
09/08/2019, 12:56 - Rob;: Leicester Wolves interesting
09/08/2019, 12:57 - David;: whats your villa beef?
09/08/2019, 12:57 - Rob;: Foxes Vs wolves. The canine derby
09/08/2019, 12:57 - David;: is that the one televised or the arsenal game?
09/08/2019, 12:58 - Rob;: My dad hates them, which I think is just a bit of a local Chippy thing, but they've often popped up as a jebby little bogey team for Arsenal, which has cemented it for me
09/08/2019, 12:58 - Rob;: And the John Terry connection now
09/08/2019, 12:59 - David;: I'm indifferent to positive. Liked that team they had with Young, Milner, Downing, Agbonlahor
09/08/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: That was quite good
09/08/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: I've always liked how 'shit on the villa' has caught on as a phrase
09/08/2019, 13:01 - David;: Stilian Petrov
09/08/2019, 13:02 - David;: John Carew
09/08/2019, 13:04 - David;: Rob what was your favourite ever non-Arsenal team in the prem?
09/08/2019, 13:05 - David;: Pulis' Stoke I presume
09/08/2019, 13:07 - David;: I quite liked the blackburn team with Gamst-Pederson and Bentley
09/08/2019, 13:07 - David;: And Allardyced Trollton Wanderers
09/08/2019, 13:07 - Paul;: Surely Middlesbrough with Juninho
09/08/2019, 13:07 - David;: Roque Santa Cruz
09/08/2019, 13:08 - David;: That era before city became good but had bought loads of ridiculous players and were still managed by Hughes. Was amusing.
09/08/2019, 13:08 - Paul;: Stephen Ireland
09/08/2019, 13:08 - Paul;: Huge player
09/08/2019, 13:08 - David;: Yeah, Stephen Ireland feeding Robinho
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: I loved the Reading side that came up when we were in sixth form
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: Real plucky fuckers
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: Kevin Doyle, Kitson, Shane long up front
09/08/2019, 13:09 - David;: Fucking Kitson
09/08/2019, 13:09 - Rob;: Nicky Shorey, Steve Sidwell, Harper
09/08/2019, 13:10 - David;: they were all ginger
09/08/2019, 13:10 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 13:10 - Rob;: A team of plucky gingers
09/08/2019, 13:10 - Rob;: Played as them on Footy Manager so they were my lads
09/08/2019, 13:11 - David;: I gained a huge affinity for Sunderland through FM. Managed a middling early 2010s Sunderland squad to the title.
09/08/2019, 13:11 - Paul;: Think that Blackburn team wins it for me though as Dave suggested, gamst, Bentley and roque
09/08/2019, 13:11 - Rob;: Yeah that was a good team
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: Benny McCarthy
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: Chris Samba at the back?
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: Big Samba
09/08/2019, 13:12 - David;: Yeah Samba
09/08/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: Massive
09/08/2019, 13:13 - Rob;: Gamst and Bentley were big fantasy buys
09/08/2019, 13:14 - David;: Huge.
09/08/2019, 13:14 - Rob;: Moyes' United might be my favourite side actually
09/08/2019, 13:14 - Rob;: Him and Fellaini here to fuck shit up
09/08/2019, 13:15 - David;: Ah I liked that little Portsmouth team that Redknapp put together with lots of ridiculous players.
09/08/2019, 13:15 - Rob;: The constant reincarnation of Defoe and Crouch
09/08/2019, 13:15 - Rob;: One's big and one's small, see, it's unplayable
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: People just don't know what height to defend at
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: The yhad Kranjkar, Kanu, Lassana Diarra, Glen Johnson
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Jack G;: Was a big fan of that Newcastle team with Cisse and Ba
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Sully Muntari was there
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Before his Inter move
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: Sol Campbell
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: Ridiculous squad
09/08/2019, 13:16 - David;: Distin
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: That Portsmouth team brought them a brief moment of glory, but it's ruined them ever since
09/08/2019, 13:16 - Rob;: Big Linvoy Primus
09/08/2019, 13:17 - Rob;: Pedro Mendes?
09/08/2019, 13:18 - David;: what was the glory - did they win a little FA cup?
09/08/2019, 13:18 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
09/08/2019, 13:18 - Rob;: Yeah FA cup
09/08/2019, 13:19 - Rob;: Roy Hodgson's Europa League final team. Based essentially around Hangerland's huge bonce
09/08/2019, 13:19 - Rob;: *Fulham
09/08/2019, 13:20 - David;: That was a bonce though
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Who else did they have?
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Dempsey?
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Old Clunt
09/08/2019, 13:20 - David;: Yeah the fulham team was great, with Berbatov
09/08/2019, 13:20 - Rob;: Clemp Dumpsey
09/08/2019, 13:21 - David;: Your Zamoras
09/08/2019, 13:21 - David;: That little bald cunt striker as well
09/08/2019, 13:21 - Rob;: Andy Johnson?
09/08/2019, 13:22 - Rob;: Climp Derpsey
09/08/2019, 13:22 - David;: yeah andy johnson
09/08/2019, 13:23 - David;: they had dembele before he went to spurs
09/08/2019, 13:25 - David;: Redknapp generally constructed madcap ridiculous teams. His spurs one where they had Bentley, Bale, Modric, Van der Vaart, Berbatov, Defoe
09/08/2019, 13:32 - Rob;: Clampt Clumpsey
09/08/2019, 13:35 - David;: Klump Clampsey
09/08/2019, 13:35 - David;: Klerk Clumpsey
09/08/2019, 13:36 - Jack G;: Klimp klompsey
09/08/2019, 13:36 - David;: Klerk Derpsey
09/08/2019, 14:58 - Jack G;: Can’t wait for there to be a controversial VAR decision tonight. I ❤ VAR
09/08/2019, 15:01 - David;: Var is shit. Runing football.
09/08/2019, 15:01 - Jack G;: No more offside goals from Salah 👌
09/08/2019, 15:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Not aware of this being a  significant issue
09/08/2019, 15:08 - Rob;: With VAR Salah would have scored 3 goals
09/08/2019, 15:09 - Rob;: It is known
09/08/2019, 15:12 - Jack G;: Rainman Rob strikes again
09/08/2019, 15:19 - David;: You'd be more on the mark if you focussed on his soft penno's
09/08/2019, 15:21 - Jack G;: They’ve also changed the handball rules for this season. Watch pundits still not be able to agree on whether something is handball or not
09/08/2019, 15:23 - Rob;: Maybe they should do VAR after the match, so you play on then find out if you won later
09/08/2019, 15:24 - Rob;: No gaps in play. You have to try to win by more than one goal
09/08/2019, 15:24 - David;: So you could be 3-0 down without knowing, playing out for the draw?
09/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: Yeah
09/08/2019, 15:27 - Damian Rumble: I'm just going to leave this here...
09/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: So if you score a dodgy -seeming goal you feel like you need another as insurance
09/08/2019, 15:29 - Jack G;: What happens if someone got a red card unfairly?
09/08/2019, 15:30 - David;: The entire game would have to be re-modelled in a simulation to remove all of their subsequent touches and see how the game panned out.
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Jack G;: Lol
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Replay for the remaining minutes
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Everyone in the crowd has to come back to recreate the exact atmosphere
09/08/2019, 15:31 - David;: Nah huge computer simulation to determine who won.
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Ok
09/08/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Sure
09/08/2019, 15:32 - David;: So most games are now just simulated. Any game that had an overturned decision has to be modelled virtually.
09/08/2019, 15:33 - Jack G;: Just simulate the whole season now, no need to play any matches
09/08/2019, 15:34 - Jack G;: Or you can broadcast all simulations each game week. Go to the pub to watch a computer churn out a result
09/08/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: Yeah, and even though it could be processed in one day, they still stage it August to May
09/08/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: So they can input actual weather conditions
09/08/2019, 15:35 - David;: Or you have an endless brancing of game scenarios that have to be played. So e.g. in a game someone gets sent off. You have to play the game through from there 11 vs 11 as if it was an incorrect decision, and also 10 vs 11 from there as if it was correct. And then if more questionable decisions happen within those different replays you also have to play both of those through to the end. So you could end up with 10-20 different versions of the match.
09/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: The game takes weeks to play. Then you assess with VAR which version sould actually be picked as the result.
09/08/2019, 15:38 - David;: How does the data on player statistics and attributes come from if no games are being played though. Would we eventually end up watching randomly generated players like in FM?
09/08/2019, 15:42 - Rob;: No, people have to have careers and train etc in order to provide data for the simulation
09/08/2019, 15:44 - David;: Ah right yeah
09/08/2019, 15:44 - David;: So still playing matches but just behind doors to generate the data
09/08/2019, 15:45 - David;: Do we know who the players are, get to see their faces etc. - you could have them as pundits commentating on their own simulated careers, analysing their performances, dissapointed when they go off form in the simulations etc.
09/08/2019, 16:13 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
09/08/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: They're like people who've had films based on their life
09/08/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: I would love for Delia to do another drunken half-time speech tonight
09/08/2019, 16:48 - Paul;: What’s the impact on wages and sponsorship? Are they represented as a badly rendered computer sprite. People have posters of them up rather than the actual person
09/08/2019, 16:48 - Paul;: A grainy player on the footy man pitch in the simulation
09/08/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Jack get Ozil out
09/08/2019, 18:10 - Rob;: Not in the squad due to CRIME
09/08/2019, 18:13 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah he’s out already
09/08/2019, 19:54 - David;: Are they they taking Drmic?
09/08/2019, 19:56 - Rob;: Dr Mic Drmic
09/08/2019, 20:00 - Damian Rumble: Captain Mane. Mane starts on the bench. Off to a great start...
09/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: Could have told you that
09/08/2019, 20:01 - Jack G;: >not researching. Mane barely played pre season
09/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: It was known
09/08/2019, 20:01 - David;: New rule - dont have to goal kick out of box now
09/08/2019, 20:02 - Rob;: Yeah Damo you'd have found that out by reading any preview
09/08/2019, 20:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Doubt he will get on unless we need a goal
09/08/2019, 20:04 - David;: Pukking hell
09/08/2019, 20:06 - Jack G;: Teemu Pukki
09/08/2019, 20:06 - Jack G;: Strong name
09/08/2019, 20:09 - David;: Divock
09/08/2019, 20:09 - David;: Only scores awful or bizare goals
09/08/2019, 20:10 - Hamish Sinclair: With the only exception being in the champions league final
09/08/2019, 20:12 - Paul;: Top of the league then
09/08/2019, 20:22 - David;: Pub I'm in also has partick thistle vs Dundee showing. Much more interest in that game.
09/08/2019, 20:22 - Paul;: Pukki almost with a goal
09/08/2019, 20:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Are you in the Wally dug?
09/08/2019, 20:23 - David;: Nah don't think Wally has sports
09/08/2019, 20:24 - David;: Norwich look good
09/08/2019, 20:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah I agree
09/08/2019, 20:26 - Jack G;: Need to sharpen up at the back here for sure
09/08/2019, 20:38 - Paul;: Damo, how furious are you with mane?
09/08/2019, 20:49 - Jack G;: Hansen sitting next to Deliah
09/08/2019, 20:53 - David;: Shattered broken little Gary neville
09/08/2019, 20:53 - David;: Love it
09/08/2019, 21:02 - Damian Rumble: All the previews I looked at only focused on who was going to play. Not who wasn't
09/08/2019, 21:03 - Phill: As a data analyst, could you not infer the later from the former?
09/08/2019, 21:03 - Damian Rumble: Somewhat mediated by having by van dijk and trent
09/08/2019, 21:04 - Damian Rumble: My model didn't have a feature for inexplicably leaving you best player from last season on the bench
09/08/2019, 21:04 - Damian Rumble: Noob error really...
09/08/2019, 21:05 - David;: Highly explicable
09/08/2019, 21:05 - David;: The explanation is Afcon
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Rob;: Mane coming on and doing nothing to waste your captaincy must hurt
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Phill: Top of the leage
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Paul;: Lol that’s great
09/08/2019, 21:57 - Paul;: Liverpool’s year
09/08/2019, 21:58 - Hamish Sinclair: THE CHAMPIONS ELECT
09/08/2019, 22:23 - Damian Rumble: And another year of FF related butt hurt begins...
09/08/2019, 22:23 - David;: Champions elect
09/08/2019, 22:24 - Damian Rumble: Couldn't even keep a clean sheet
09/08/2019, 22:24 - David;: How many points are you  on?
09/08/2019, 22:26 - Paul;: 15 pts
09/08/2019, 22:55 - Phill: 22 pts
09/08/2019, 22:56 - David;: 22
09/08/2019, 22:56 - David;: Salah (c) + robbo?
09/08/2019, 23:00 - Phill: Yeah
09/08/2019, 23:04 - Rob;: 28 so far, Salah (C) and Virgil
09/08/2019, 23:13 - David;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 08:43 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 08:53 - Paul;: Shithousery
10/08/2019, 08:57 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 08:58 - Sam;: Pepe and lacazette are also doubts
10/08/2019, 09:32 - David;: Lol
10/08/2019, 09:32 - David;: He's literally been there a day
10/08/2019, 09:37 - Jack G;: He was already injured at Celtic though, Arsenal were aware of this before signing him
10/08/2019, 10:03 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 10:10 - David;: More excited about the punditry or the match?
10/08/2019, 10:10 - David;: What's the starting line-up United?
10/08/2019, 10:12 - Sam;: Honestly don’t know. Back 5 is sorted, but after that it’s only rashford pogba and martial that’s nailed on.
10/08/2019, 10:13 - David;: The boy Fred?
10/08/2019, 10:14 - David;: The boy James?
10/08/2019, 10:15 - Sam;: Can’t see Fred getting it. Would like to see a bold choice in drop matic and platings mctominay and pereira mata or lingard through the middle
10/08/2019, 10:16 - David;: Is Sanchez just ded now?
10/08/2019, 10:17 - Sam;: If he can’t be flogged in this window then he’ll have to be a back up player
10/08/2019, 10:17 - David;: That's mental
10/08/2019, 10:19 - Sam;: Has to be done to make a statement that United won’t pay silly wages to get a big name anymore. If you don’t perform you’re out. Sanchez is that last one of those signing left
10/08/2019, 10:21 - Jack G;: You did well to get so much cash back for Lukaku
10/08/2019, 10:21 - David;: So Maguire's minimum wage then?
10/08/2019, 10:23 - Sam;: He’s not just a big name. Clearly a good defender and we needed a CB. We didn’t need Sanchez, it was clearly opportunistic and to try and beat city
10/08/2019, 10:24 - Sam;: Not part of a clear strategy like OGS has now. Which is why lukaku had to go
10/08/2019, 10:36 - Hamish Sinclair: What's this story?
10/08/2019, 12:06 - David;: Cresswell starts Jack
10/08/2019, 12:06 - David;: Instant bad information
10/08/2019, 12:07 - David;: Strong front 4 for west ham
10/08/2019, 12:15 - Jack G;: I did mention he’d rotate with Masuaku. Cresswell is better defensively so makes sense to play against Sterling
10/08/2019, 12:20 - Jack G;: Hoping for a Lanzini master class
10/08/2019, 13:15 - Jack G;: City getting away with so many niggly fouls
10/08/2019, 13:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah they do that
10/08/2019, 13:17 - Jack G;: 10 fouls 0 yellows
10/08/2019, 13:17 - Hamish Sinclair: They make fouls high up the pitch because your more likely to get booked the closer they get to goal
10/08/2019, 13:17 - Hamish Sinclair: They did it all last season
10/08/2019, 13:42 - Rob;: Mental
10/08/2019, 13:42 - Rob;: Varce
10/08/2019, 13:43 - Jack G;: Lol thanks VAR
10/08/2019, 13:44 - Jack G;: I ❤ VAR
10/08/2019, 13:56 - Paul;: VAR shit though? Everyone is hating it
10/08/2019, 13:59 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 13:59 - Jack G;: Offside is offside
10/08/2019, 14:00 - Damian Rumble: Brexit means Brexit
10/08/2019, 14:00 - Rob;: But it was an offside I'm not sure a linesman would ever spot in real time. An offside in letter but not in spirit
10/08/2019, 14:01 - Jack G;: Fuck off Ederson
10/08/2019, 14:04 - Jack G;: VAR again p
10/08/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: That was brilliant
10/08/2019, 14:11 - Rob;: Of ffs
10/08/2019, 14:11 - Rob;: This is just  exhausting
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Rob;: Still love VAR, Jack?
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: It’s getting embarrassing
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Paul;: Lol trolled by var
10/08/2019, 14:13 - Jack G;: Would rather the match had just been simulated
10/08/2019, 14:14 - Jack G;: This is going to happen every penalty. Keepers are so used to jump starts
10/08/2019, 14:19 - Paul;: And we can’t get rid of var?
10/08/2019, 14:19 - Paul;: No going back?
10/08/2019, 14:19 - Jack G;: Ffs
10/08/2019, 14:20 - Damian Rumble: Fucking hate it when the two most expensive players in the game both live up to their extortionate price tag
10/08/2019, 14:20 - Paul;: Who has sterling?
10/08/2019, 14:21 - Jack G;: Bottom of the league then
10/08/2019, 14:21 - Paul;: Ah of course Dave has sterling
10/08/2019, 14:33 - Paul;: Time for big sig
10/08/2019, 14:34 - Rob;: Bigurdson?
10/08/2019, 14:34 - Paul;: Yeah. Anticipating a huge season
10/08/2019, 14:40 - Jack G;: It’s all about Digne
10/08/2019, 14:40 - Paul;: Sharp on the bench
10/08/2019, 14:41 - Paul;: Digne overhyped
10/08/2019, 14:51 - Damian Rumble: Digne can suck a bag of dicks
10/08/2019, 14:52 - Sam;: Digne is quality. Dwight McNeil starting for Burnley.
10/08/2019, 14:52 - Paul;: Dwight McNeil?
10/08/2019, 14:55 - Sam;: I think he’ll be quality, just wasn’t sure if Dyche would give him enough minutes to break through
10/08/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: I hope Burnley get back their defence
10/08/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: That trolled me so hard last season
10/08/2019, 14:56 - Paul;: I’ve put a lot of investment in defence this season
10/08/2019, 15:08 - Sam;: FOOTBALL
10/08/2019, 15:57 - David;: Not thrilling so far
10/08/2019, 16:47 - Rob;: The Sharp shooter
10/08/2019, 16:48 - Paul;: Old sharpers
10/08/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Billy the adult
10/08/2019, 17:01 - Hamish Sinclair: SEAGULLS
10/08/2019, 18:08 - David;: Pumping billy
10/08/2019, 18:09 - David;: So prem level then
10/08/2019, 18:09 - David;: World class
10/08/2019, 18:18 - Paul;: Is that good enough for you Sam
10/08/2019, 18:18 - Paul;: Doubting Samuel
10/08/2019, 19:25 - Paul;: Kane. Hib.
10/08/2019, 19:32 - Phill: <Media omitted>
10/08/2019, 22:29 - / James Ball: BT 🙁
11/08/2019, 00:00 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
11/08/2019, 00:00 - / James Ball: Indian Damo
11/08/2019, 11:08 - Paul;: That bergkamp goal everyone goes on about. Not even that good
11/08/2019, 11:31 - Phill: Always said that.
11/08/2019, 11:31 - Phill: Overrated shit.
11/08/2019, 11:37 - David;: Which one? World cup or the flick around the player
11/08/2019, 12:27 - Paul;: Flick around
11/08/2019, 12:33 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
11/08/2019, 12:46 - David;: This was in an official medical context?
11/08/2019, 13:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, in the medical notes. Legal document right there
11/08/2019, 13:37 - Phill: How has this person acquired a gash next to her gash?
11/08/2019, 14:20 - Hamish Sinclair: That's not explained
11/08/2019, 15:49 - Rob;: Almiron is a strange looking bloke
11/08/2019, 15:49 - Rob;: Liza Minnelli vibe
11/08/2019, 15:54 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
11/08/2019, 16:03 - Damian Rumble: Yaaaas England
11/08/2019, 16:08 - Jack G;: Arsenal have equaled the total number of away clean sheets they had last season
11/08/2019, 16:09 - Rob;: Yeah, champions as home, relegation fighters away last season
11/08/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: Mason Mount - stupid name
11/08/2019, 16:33 - Sam;: Mount Mason better?
11/08/2019, 16:33 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
11/08/2019, 16:33 - Rob;: Would climb
11/08/2019, 16:54 - Jack G;: Zouma looks shocking, bet Chelsea are glad they sold Luiz
11/08/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: New Ukip leader is called Dick Braine
11/08/2019, 17:33 - Damian Rumble: What even is ukip?
11/08/2019, 18:09 - Rob;: Chelsea ded
11/08/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Maguire and wan Bissaka were bargains
11/08/2019, 18:43 - Phill: Chelsea are complete toilet now
11/08/2019, 18:43 - Phill: Mid table I reckon
11/08/2019, 18:43 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
11/08/2019, 18:45 - Rob;: Yeah, that was one of the worst midfield performances I've seen
11/08/2019, 18:45 - Rob;: The Sanchez curse
11/08/2019, 18:45 - Rob;: No chance of him keeping his place
11/08/2019, 18:46 - Sam;: Who replaces
11/08/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Ozil, Cellabos or Willock directly
11/08/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Or just reshuffle things a bit and bring in any of the other attackers - Lacazette or Pepe
11/08/2019, 18:50 - Sam;: Yeah, still to see how the boy Pepe fits in
11/08/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: In winnable matches I would like to see:
.            Lacazette
Auba                        Pepe
.         Ozil or Cellabos
.        Torreira   Xhaka
Tierney                   Bellerin
.        Sokratis  Holding
11/08/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: In tougher matches swap the number 10 for another deeper lying midfielder
11/08/2019, 19:00 - Sam;: Just need a huge CB to be decent
11/08/2019, 19:00 - Sam;: A slab head if you will
11/08/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Yeah, and then upgrade on Xhaka
11/08/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Hopefully Saliba next season will be the one at CB
11/08/2019, 19:28 - Paul;: Salibaba and the 40 thieves
11/08/2019, 19:42 - Rob;: Listening to a radio programme about trephaning. First interviews an old dude who drilled a hole in his head himself because he wanted to be high all the time
11/08/2019, 19:43 - Rob;: Maintains that it's made him feel 30% high all the time
11/08/2019, 19:43 - Rob;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sounds/play/p074k65t
11/08/2019, 19:44 - Paul;: Proven to work is it?
11/08/2019, 19:45 - Rob;: He seems very happy
11/08/2019, 19:45 - Rob;: And, crucially, is alive
11/08/2019, 19:48 - Paul;: What kind of high is it?
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: He rated normal like as 0 and acid as 100, so closer to normality as acid
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: He defined it as higher consciousness
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: He just loves blood in his brain
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: Will do anything for more blood there
11/08/2019, 19:50 - Paul;: How does it work in terms of drilling through the skull?
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Paul;: His brains out there for the world
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: He had an antique instrument
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: And local anesthic
11/08/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: Had some aborted attempts on his forehead
11/08/2019, 19:59 - Paul;: But is he just left with a gaping hole and that’s fine?
11/08/2019, 20:01 - Rob;: I think you leave the skin and let it heal over the hole
11/08/2019, 20:08 - Paul;: Still quite mental
11/08/2019, 21:42 - Stefan;: Very reassuring to have the skin regrow over the hole
11/08/2019, 21:43 - Stefan;: Babies have that hole in their skull - presumably they're 30% high all the time
11/08/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Yes that was actually a point he made
11/08/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: He linked your skull firming up as you grow up to original sin and the loss of innocence
11/08/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: Said he had returned himself to the higher consciousness of childhood
11/08/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: A more instinctive animal -like state that he says humans lost when they began to walk upright and blood was less able to reach the brain.
11/08/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: He ❤ brain blood
11/08/2019, 21:47 - Paul;: I don’t get how drilling a hole equals more brain blood
11/08/2019, 22:01 - David;: Will probably give that a miss
11/08/2019, 22:01 - Rob;: It gives your blood vessels more room and makes the whole skull less rigid so there is more room
11/08/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: Proper surgeons will on occasion bore holes in your skull to relieve some disorders
11/08/2019, 22:03 - David;: Very close with the antique instrument
11/08/2019, 22:04 - David;: How normal or mental did he come across?
11/08/2019, 22:04 - David;: Would you employ him?
11/08/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: I think if he were speaking about other things you wouldn't necessarily guess he had a hole in his head
11/08/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: Sounded quite old and eloquent
11/08/2019, 22:05 - Rob;: Stopped himself once or twice and said, 'you must think me mad when I say this'
11/08/2019, 22:06 - Rob;: Sounded like a granddad but just loves getting high. Moved to Amsterdam for the buzz.
11/08/2019, 22:16 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
11/08/2019, 22:40 - Rob;: Ah number 10

14/08/2019, 22:55 - Paul;: Tactically better to lose it. Got nothing to aim for now for the season
14/08/2019, 22:58 - David;: Trophy in the bag. Still on  for the sextuple

16/08/2019, 11:50 - David;: Love to see who will be the bench keeper. Lonergan himself was out of contract over the summer and training with us for free.
16/08/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: I love how football can elevate people suddenly into huge situations
16/08/2019, 11:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Apparently lonergan the oldest english player to make his premier league debut in the 21st century, I'd it happens
16/08/2019, 11:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Great to see everyone who bought adrian last week get fucked over though

16/08/2019, 11:54 - Rob;: I settled on waiting for two weeks of data with which to make changes

16/08/2019, 11:55 - David;: I bought Adrian in so got a bit fucked - but seems like if he misses this week will be in for next anyway.
16/08/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: I have options. I don't need all my bench players to start

20/08/2019, 11:29 - Rob;: I went for him, but he's not in the long term plan necessarily, he just frees up value to shift around midfield

20/08/2019, 11:33 - Rob;: Xabi Alonso / Santi Cazorla-esque ball player with a range of passing
20/08/2019, 11:33 - Rob;: Looks good for a booking though
20/08/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: He will probably play deeper in some games, but imagine he will still remain decent value for 5.5. He'll never be defending
20/08/2019, 11:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Hes already got a band wagon rolling
20/08/2019, 11:34 - Hamish Sinclair: 5.6m
20/08/2019, 11:35 - Rob;: Cue sending off next week in huge defeat to Liverpool
20/08/2019, 11:37 - David;: I wont be investing
20/08/2019, 11:40 - David;: I just need to ride the trossard bubble to its logical conclusion
20/08/2019, 11:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Never sell
20/08/2019, 11:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Brighton have looked solid so far this seasom
20/08/2019, 11:42 - Paul;: Yeah trossard. First name on the team sheet
20/08/2019, 11:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Solly March has potential, playing wide left wing back, will get goals and assists
20/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Brighton could be the new Watford
20/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Burnley the new Stoke / the old Burnley
20/08/2019, 11:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Villa the new Fulham obviously
20/08/2019, 11:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Crystal palace the new newcastle and vice versa
20/08/2019, 11:45 - Paul;: Man U the new...
20/08/2019, 11:45 - Rob;: Everton
20/08/2019, 11:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Chelsea look alot like the old liverpool, Brendan Rodgers era
20/08/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: Would be good to have a Chelsea fan in the mix
20/08/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: Bit of variety
20/08/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Draft Nodd in
20/08/2019, 11:53 - David;: Norwich the new Swansea
20/08/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: Norwich the new arsenal
20/08/2019, 11:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Pukki the new michu
20/08/2019, 11:54 - David;: yeah yeah
20/08/2019, 11:55 - Rob;: Sharp the current Kane
20/08/2019, 11:56 - David;: But better - has scored more goals
20/08/2019, 11:56 - Rob;: Yeah, Kane not yet Sharp
20/08/2019, 11:59 - David;: I refuse to negotiate with Digne
20/08/2019, 11:59 - Hamish Sinclair: I was part of dignes grassroots support
20/08/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: Been with digne from day 1
20/08/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: Shunned for my support. Now vindicated
20/08/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, always been in for the boy Digne
20/08/2019, 12:06 - Paul;: Dave, is there anyone you’re negotiating with?
20/08/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Lindstrom
20/08/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Lindstram*
20/08/2019, 12:07 - Phill: Midfielder. Classified as a defender.
20/08/2019, 12:08 - David;: In negotiations with Aubameyang but he's asking too much
20/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: My representatives are also talking to Rashford.
20/08/2019, 12:10 - Rob;: I thinking of offering something to Martial
20/08/2019, 12:10 - Rob;: Dat extra point per goal
20/08/2019, 12:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Already hopped on martial
20/08/2019, 12:11 - Rob;: He's in my sights next week
20/08/2019, 12:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Aubameyang, what's he asking these days, 11?
20/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Yeah - I was going to get Martial straight swap for Moura but then Moura trolled me by scoring.
20/08/2019, 12:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Got a Dunk in this week
20/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: Yeah yeah. It would require an enron style accounting fudge for me to work him in without losing sterling or Mane
20/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: I'm looking into it
20/08/2019, 12:12 - Paul;: Got my martial new in for next week
20/08/2019, 12:13 - Rob;: I had to pivot to Sterling. Can't let that get out of hand
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: Yeah that can really get away from you
20/08/2019, 12:14 - Paul;: Salah ded
20/08/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Is Salah really worth 1m more than Mane?
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: No
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: I've got Mane in now hes fit again
20/08/2019, 12:14 - David;: that was my transfer this week
20/08/2019, 12:15 - Jack G;: My team is fucked, might have to wildcard
20/08/2019, 12:15 - Rob;: Yeah, Mane in for Salah might help me get some non bandwagonny strikers
20/08/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: How did it fuck you up so badly
20/08/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: On the face of it looks fine
20/08/2019, 12:18 - Jack G;: Started off with pulisic, mistake. Pepe is a cash sink atm as he’s not starting and plays Liverpool next
20/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: Yeah couldnt predict any problems looking at the line-up
20/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: Lol, the cash sink
20/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: toxic assets all over your balance sheet
20/08/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: Jack he'll start soon, it'll be fine
20/08/2019, 12:19 - Jack G;: Need to keep the Pepe faith
20/08/2019, 12:19 - David;: Jack, how's your Pepe?
20/08/2019, 12:20 - Jack G;: Not so good
20/08/2019, 13:38 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
20/08/2019, 14:57 - Damian Rumble: Had to triple transfer this week. Invested in pukkie, sterling and caballos. Bandwagoning hard.
20/08/2019, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: Loving all the Mane U turns though
20/08/2019, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: Got big issues with Barkley though
20/08/2019, 15:08 - Rob;: Yeah same. I think I just have to hope he recoups value while playing easy teams. Have bigger problems to fix first
20/08/2019, 15:10 - Hamish Sinclair: This could have been avoided with some research, Mason Mount was always going to be preferred
20/08/2019, 15:11 - Rob;: He was playing really well in pre season, was tipped more than Mount
20/08/2019, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: Again the research I did told me Barkley was the favourite
20/08/2019, 15:12 - Rob;: He's cheap anyway. Not a cash sink
20/08/2019, 15:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Lampard doing a solskjaer by playing slightly inferior youth as a way to manage his narrative of average results
20/08/2019, 15:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Was always going to happen (admittedly easier to say this now it has happened)
20/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Oh dear
20/08/2019, 15:17 - Hamish Sinclair: They'd have to get 14 points to break even
20/08/2019, 15:18 - Damian Rumble: Only a four point hit as had one in hand
20/08/2019, 15:18 - Damian Rumble: Queue Sterling dry spell...
20/08/2019, 15:18 - Hamish Sinclair: More reasonable
20/08/2019, 15:19 - David;: Did you look into Pukkis next 3 fixtures? Enjoy thay
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: Got one against Liverpool
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Scored against liverpool though
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: He doesn't care who he plays
20/08/2019, 15:19 - Rob;: Scores when he wants I've heard them say
20/08/2019, 15:21 - David;: Going to enjoy the pukki bubble deflating
20/08/2019, 15:21 - Paul;: Can’t fukki the pukki. That’s what they’re saying
20/08/2019, 15:22 - Rob;: You should be so Pukki, David
20/08/2019, 15:23 - David;: I was Pukki. Identified him in pre-season straight away. But now too much buzz, he is dead to me
20/08/2019, 15:23 - David;: I will never own him
20/08/2019, 15:23 - Rob;: Have you forgiven Vardy yet?
20/08/2019, 15:24 - David;: Almost - could contemplate a Vardy
20/08/2019, 15:24 - Rob;: You were dead against for a long time. Felt like he'd wronged you
20/08/2019, 15:26 - David;: You don't see a lot of teams with vardy in these days. He's less cleche than he was
20/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: One thing I read pointed out at that at his price point there's no one even close in average point tally over teh last few seasons
20/08/2019, 15:27 - Rob;: If you can't have caviar, you have Vardy
20/08/2019, 15:29 - Damian Rumble: Carey has strong stats but can he do it on a wet night in Stoke?
20/08/2019, 15:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah his points per pound is proabbly still very good
20/08/2019, 15:32 - Hamish Sinclair: What do you need to forgive him for?
20/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: Not getting him until late in the year they won the league. The bandwagon that got away
20/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: Tipping Almiron to have a big season
20/08/2019, 15:36 - David;: No one would predict an almiron
20/08/2019, 15:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Would agree if Benitez still there
20/08/2019, 15:37 - Hamish Sinclair: But for the bruce
20/08/2019, 15:38 - David;: Yeah Bruce really puts a downer on things
20/08/2019, 15:40 - David;: The most underwhelming appointment in football
20/08/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Had Carry for the whole of that year and somehow managed not to win it.
20/08/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Barry*
20/08/2019, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Vardy*
20/08/2019, 15:41 - Rob;: Billboard Baggage

20/08/2019, 22:16 - Rob;: Hard to want it
20/08/2019, 22:18 - David;: They'll john that
20/08/2019, 22:18 - Rob;: Yeah
20/08/2019, 22:18 - Rob;: There's huge potential to reboot it, in some other version of the similation
20/08/2019, 22:19 - Rob;: With good writers
21/08/2019, 06:56 - Jack G;: Matrix Resurrection
21/08/2019, 06:58 - Phill: Matrix Referendum

21/08/2019, 09:15 - Sam;: Ah. Does he know.
21/08/2019, 11:43 - Jack G;: Looks like I’m going to be the first to arrive at Wales on Friday. Where are the keys kept? Not actually been first on the scene before
21/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Above the lower barn door to the right
21/08/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Paul, Sam and I shouldn't be too far behind you
21/08/2019, 11:44 - Jack G;: 👍 cheers
21/08/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: Message when you get there then can let you know how far away we are/could meet up at the coop for initial booze run
21/08/2019, 12:00 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah will do. The booze wagon
21/08/2019, 12:03 - David;: So is it 4 cars going in total - Me, Jack, Paul and Phil? Could be a bit tight in the old car park.
21/08/2019, 12:04 - David;: Will my Vauxhall no be getting up the track.
21/08/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: If Paul's in the 4x4 that'll make space
21/08/2019, 12:04 - David;: Yeah will be fine, we'll tetris it somehow
21/08/2019, 12:05 - Rob;: Beer deals nonexistent at Coop. If we get a chance to Tesco first we should Tesco. Lots of 2 for £20 crates
21/08/2019, 12:05 - Paul;: Not in 4x4
21/08/2019, 12:05 - David;: Also can leave a car at the middle barn if anyone can get up the first bit.
21/08/2019, 12:05 - Paul;: Ok Tesco enroute
21/08/2019, 12:06 - Rob;: 72 Carlsberg for £40. Hate the taste live the value
21/08/2019, 12:06 - Paul;: How’s the old track these days? Phil said he made it up when he last went
21/08/2019, 12:06 - David;: We're better than this now
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Quite fearful of wrecking the underside of my car otherwise would go up
21/08/2019, 12:07 - David;: Surely we're beyond Carlsberg
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: I’ll be getting that deal
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Booze in the bonce. Done
21/08/2019, 12:07 - Rob;: 80 bottles of Stella for £40?
21/08/2019, 12:08 - David;: What car are you in? There's 2 slightly sketchy bits, the first corner and then steep bit after the barn.
21/08/2019, 12:08 - Paul;: Audi
21/08/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: 80 bottles will go in an afternoon
21/08/2019, 12:08 - David;: Its not in a worse or better state than it usually is, but its generally quite shit.
21/08/2019, 12:08 - Jack G;: Will you be purchasing craft ales Dave?
21/08/2019, 12:09 - David;: Yes.
21/08/2019, 12:09 - David;: Bottled stella goat
21/08/2019, 12:09 - David;: Might need 160
21/08/2019, 12:09 - Jack G;: Also crisps, all the crisps
21/08/2019, 12:10 - Rob;: Big job carrying 160 Stella bottles to the bin. Best to car that down early doors
21/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: Might buy a bit of wine and nicer beers to mix in with the general piss
21/08/2019, 12:10 - David;: Okay 240 to be safe?
21/08/2019, 12:11 - David;: There is other bloot available though - not sure I will drink vast amounts. 160 should do it.
21/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: Need to plan meals. Could do a big chilli one night.
21/08/2019, 12:12 - Rob;: I like shifting the customary pizza meal to the last night to minimise washing up
21/08/2019, 12:12 - Rob;: Rather than night 1
21/08/2019, 12:12 - David;: Obviously background grazing pizzas
21/08/2019, 12:13 - David;: Yeah minimise waste where possible. We could do a BBQ with that in mind.
21/08/2019, 12:13 - David;: Maybe chilli Friday, BBQ saturday night and pizza sunday?
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Yeah sounds nice
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Paul;: Rob will you bringing plasters with you
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Paul;: *you be
21/08/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Always, Paul
21/08/2019, 12:15 - Sam;: let's not instantly pack the gut with chilli. can we downgrade to a mild spag bol? for all our sakes.
21/08/2019, 12:17 - Jack G;: I’m happy with either
21/08/2019, 12:18 - David;: No we need to be sharting horribly right from the beginning
21/08/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: Would a chilli make one shart?
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Rob;: Would bracket with spag bol on the gut-ometer
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Paul;: No only Sam and his guts
21/08/2019, 12:19 - David;: Ah the spice will get you though
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Sam;: exactly
21/08/2019, 12:19 - Sam;: chilli arse
21/08/2019, 12:20 - Sam;: day one
21/08/2019, 12:20 - David;: Paul you need to source lots of dried apricots
21/08/2019, 12:20 - David;: Could just do a huge claggy pasta instead of chilli.
21/08/2019, 12:20 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
21/08/2019, 12:26 - David;: Who's in for Snowdon on Saturday? The defroust to set up the deep froust
21/08/2019, 12:29 - Rob;: Yeah
21/08/2019, 12:43 - Paul;: Very dependent on the day. I make no future commitments
21/08/2019, 12:46 - Phill: Can no committ to that. Might be decending the k-hole
21/08/2019, 12:46 - David;: I put the likelihood of your involvement at 0%
21/08/2019, 12:47 - David;: When will you be cracking out the all day sleeping bag?
21/08/2019, 12:48 - Paul;: Immediately. I shall become a human rat
21/08/2019, 12:59 - David;: Preparation for the long-anticipated attempt on the summit of Snowdon was remarkably poor. The expedition allocated funds for 160 bottles of french lager, but had made no plans to acquire basic climbing equipment. Few of the team had spent any time at altitude. One of its members had stated his intention to take large amounts of ketamine the night before the summit attempt.
21/08/2019, 13:00 - Rob;: Another was a human rat
21/08/2019, 13:06 - Jack G;: One got picked up by mountain rescue after getting lost wandering off from the main trail. When questioned he answered: “Sorry, had to find somewhere for an emergency shit, too much Chilli last night”
21/08/2019, 13:55 - Paul;: Alongside beer what else will we be needing?
21/08/2019, 13:58 - Sam;: brot
21/08/2019, 14:03 - Paul;: And nothing more
21/08/2019, 14:05 - Sam;: cheese. mustard and lea and perrins. we shall eat cheese on toast exclusively.
21/08/2019, 14:05 - Sam;: and one tomato
21/08/2019, 14:06 - Paul;: I would be fine with that. Clag me up
21/08/2019, 14:06 - Jack G;: Need some tomatoes to grill with it. Cut through
21/08/2019, 14:07 - Jack G;: Ah just saw you mentioned 1 tomato
21/08/2019, 14:08 - Sam;: that'll do us. thinly sliced. one atom thick to make sure it goes around
21/08/2019, 15:40 - David;: Low grade multi-pack crisps - 24+ multipack if possible
21/08/2019, 15:41 - David;: Bread. Cheese. Butter. Eggs. Bacon. Sauce. Fruit. Done.
21/08/2019, 15:42 - Jack G;: Biscuits?
21/08/2019, 15:42 - David;: Maybe dried food like pot noodles for when boiling a kettle will be all we are capable of.
21/08/2019, 16:12 - Sam;: ah yeah, pot nudes and other nude based snacks that just need boyling wata.
21/08/2019, 16:12 - Rob;: Have you written that like that with your brain?
21/08/2019, 16:13 - Sam;: no
21/08/2019, 16:13 - Sam;: fingers
21/08/2019, 16:13 - Sam;: (onto keyboard)
21/08/2019, 16:14 - David;: Anne Boyling
21/08/2019, 16:14 - Rob;: Like some medieval diary entry
21/08/2019, 16:15 - Rob;: Boyle the wata first before lowering in the pig's heade
21/08/2019, 16:15 - David;: He appears to be very broken
21/08/2019, 16:15 - David;: Question: where's our fibre coming from?
21/08/2019, 16:15 - Paul;: Dried apricots
21/08/2019, 16:16 - David;: So consolidating all of our fibre into one food stuff
21/08/2019, 16:16 - Paul;: One that produces incredible gas as well
21/08/2019, 16:26 - Rob;: Scattered comments in WhatsApp chat will be useless in a shop, but we can just get things based on the brief of: one main meal, one breakfast, beer, gump, pot noodles, basics
21/08/2019, 16:27 - David;: Milk - vital
21/08/2019, 16:27 - David;: Tea capability
21/08/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: Yeah, yeah
21/08/2019, 16:32 - David;: Bog roll also essential

21/08/2019, 17:42 - Jack G;: Just on a permanent bender then
21/08/2019, 17:42 - Jack G;: No chance for recovery
21/08/2019, 17:48 - Sam;: Not permanent. There’s just never a final bender.
21/08/2019, 17:49 - Rob;: I can't imagine ever ruling out benders forever
21/08/2019, 17:49 - Rob;: You could have some wicked benders in your old age
21/08/2019, 17:49 - David;: Yeah - even better. No sense of health or dignity needing to be preserved
21/08/2019, 17:50 - David;: There should be a 70+ age limit on all drugs. Past that you can just do whatever, go mental.
21/08/2019, 17:51 - Rob;: Yeah
21/08/2019, 17:52 - Rob;: Once you're in a home all substance laws are off
21/08/2019, 18:11 - Phill: Might spend a day fire roasting a chicken again.
21/08/2019, 19:57 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 07:27 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 07:28 - Damian Rumble: Number 4 looks like peanuts but it probably isn't
22/08/2019, 07:29 - Damian Rumble: Number 2 looks like cumin seeds but again I think that's too vanilla
22/08/2019, 07:32 - Jack G;: Number 1 tarragon?
22/08/2019, 07:42 - Rob;: No correct guesses so far
22/08/2019, 07:42 - Rob;: There's nothing that's likely to be already there
22/08/2019, 08:15 - Jack G;: #3 turmeric
22/08/2019, 08:15 - Paul;: Frankincense
22/08/2019, 08:25 - Phill: Asafoetida
22/08/2019, 08:25 - Phill: Fenugreek
22/08/2019, 08:26 - Phill: Cumin seed
22/08/2019, 08:27 - Phill: Is bottom a chipotle ?
22/08/2019, 08:53 - Rob;: Phil's mostly on the money
22/08/2019, 08:54 - Rob;: 1. Caraway seeds
2. Sumac
3. Asafoetida
4. Fenugreek
5. Either an ancho chilli or a kashmiri. They got mixed up
22/08/2019, 09:08 - Damian Rumble: Somewhat disappointed in myself that I only know two of those
22/08/2019, 09:09 - Rob;: I intentionally chose weird ones
22/08/2019, 09:13 - Paul;: Pointless spices
22/08/2019, 09:13 - Paul;: Garlic, salt, pepper. All you ever need
22/08/2019, 09:25 - Rob;: So all your heat is coming from pepper, like in pre 1500s Europe?
22/08/2019, 09:29 - Paul;: Famously salt and pepper a classic seasoning combo
22/08/2019, 09:29 - Paul;: Are you too modern for it
22/08/2019, 09:30 - Rob;: I'm not disputing that at all
22/08/2019, 09:31 - Damian Rumble: Pepper is great but paprika is better
22/08/2019, 09:33 - Rob;: Lol, not particularly analogous flavours
22/08/2019, 09:33 - Rob;: Not a like for like swap
22/08/2019, 09:33 - Paul;: “Pepper is great but ketchup is better”
22/08/2019, 09:34 - Jack G;: “Mangetout is great but dark chocolate is better”
22/08/2019, 09:35 - Rob;: 'Countdown is good, but anal penetration is better'
22/08/2019, 09:40 - Damian Rumble: https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/paprika-salt
22/08/2019, 09:40 - Damian Rumble: Clearly a legit combo
22/08/2019, 09:41 - Damian Rumble: Though the dream is all three
22/08/2019, 10:37 - David;: Pot noodles are good but I prefer caviar
22/08/2019, 10:37 - Jack G;: I prefer a flan
22/08/2019, 10:37 - Rob;: But the dream is pot noodles, caviar and a flan
22/08/2019, 10:38 - David;: I will be bringing Chipotle
22/08/2019, 10:38 - David;: In 3 different forms
22/08/2019, 10:39 - David;: In fact 4
22/08/2019, 10:39 - David;: Flakes, paste, actual tinned Chipotles and Chipotle salsa
22/08/2019, 10:49 - Rob;: Arse weltering
22/08/2019, 10:50 - Rob;: Throw the Kashmiri/ancho in there for good measure
22/08/2019, 10:51 - David;: But are we even doing the chilli? Thought it was dead in the water
22/08/2019, 10:51 - David;: So much spice capacity for nothing
22/08/2019, 10:51 - David;: I vote for a big grotty chilli
22/08/2019, 10:51 - Rob;: It got vetoed Friday night
22/08/2019, 10:52 - Rob;: But Saturday barbecue?
22/08/2019, 10:52 - Jack G;: What are we having instead of chilli?
22/08/2019, 10:54 - David;: >spag bol
22/08/2019, 10:54 - Rob;: I'm happy to cook Friday night, as I'll be there early and on the shopping trip
22/08/2019, 10:55 - Rob;: Could do something different and we do chilli on Sunday. Washing up will be fine
22/08/2019, 10:56 - David;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 10:56 - David;: The smoke stack
22/08/2019, 11:04 - David;: I still just think get a huge flaming chilli in early doors
22/08/2019, 11:10 - Paul;: Can we have different spice levels available
22/08/2019, 11:10 - David;: Only power
22/08/2019, 11:23 - Rob;: I do a good chicken satay, throwing it in as an option
22/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: Sounds good. Is that hard to scale up though?
22/08/2019, 11:26 - David;: How many pans needed
22/08/2019, 11:26 - Rob;: If we buy straight to work noodles only one large frying pan
22/08/2019, 11:27 - David;: Straight to work noodles. For the business executive
22/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Haha
22/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Non procrastinating noodles
22/08/2019, 11:28 - Rob;: Real straight shooters
22/08/2019, 11:29 - David;: Never take a day off
22/08/2019, 12:13 - Damian Rumble: How about arse clenchingly hot and sphincter ruiningly hot?
22/08/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: Jenny in my pod at work is going mental for the all-day rave music on Radio 6 today
22/08/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: Sent in this and just got it read out
22/08/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 12:32 - Rob;: All lies. Most others not lapping it up. Kate I'm particular hates all music that's not 1970s/80s disco
22/08/2019, 12:32 - Hamish Sinclair: She looks well past it aswell
22/08/2019, 12:33 - Rob;: Only she's lost days to this music
22/08/2019, 12:33 - David;: Also you havent lost days.
22/08/2019, 12:33 - David;: Only 12.30 so maximum 3.30hrs lost
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: She's refering to past raves
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: If you told me she's 24 then I'd believe this
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: She's 45
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: She was big on the 90s rave scene
22/08/2019, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, had a big one in the 90s proabbly
22/08/2019, 12:34 - David;: But that gives her more listening time to havve lost to be fair
22/08/2019, 12:35 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, her 90s stories are good
22/08/2019, 12:35 - Rob;: She loves the idea of Wales. Have discusse the benders
22/08/2019, 12:35 - David;: Was anyone disgruntled at being misrepresented for social media PR purposes?
22/08/2019, 12:36 - David;: Ah great - so she had a huge 90s? Proably best decade to get some really serious blooting in
22/08/2019, 12:36 - Hamish Sinclair: This conversation has made me put 6music on and it's currently playing underworld 👌
22/08/2019, 12:36 - Rob;: I don't think so, it's just amusing me how jarring it is for one of the people named. Literally the most Prosseco-o'clock ITV1 Formula 1 person I have ever met
22/08/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Yeah, it's been a fun show so far
22/08/2019, 12:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Love that description
22/08/2019, 12:37 - David;: Same. Am loving it to be fair
22/08/2019, 12:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Literally lost 6minutes of my life to this song
22/08/2019, 12:38 - David;: Lol, that paints a picture
22/08/2019, 12:39 - David;: But how does that translate to disco? Would imagine pop is the only place you can go from there
22/08/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Disco at its worst: it's raining men etc
22/08/2019, 12:41 - David;: Ah
22/08/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: Ok poppy disco things like Earth, Wind and Fire, but preferably played on repeat every day forever
22/08/2019, 12:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Should apply that rule to describing all people, 1. Drink 2. TV channel. 3. Sport
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Rob;: Yeah, could work
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Sambo = stella artois, sky sports news, premier league football
22/08/2019, 12:42 - David;: Sambo: Carlsberg 20 pack Sky Sports Footy
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Or variations thereof
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Rob;: Prosseco-o'clock about more than just the drink though: the sort of person who says that
22/08/2019, 12:42 - Hamish Sinclair: True
22/08/2019, 12:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Like the kind of person who tells you "your on the lash"
22/08/2019, 12:44 - Stefan;: This person also has a "live, laugh, love" fridge magnet and at least one union jack cushion
22/08/2019, 12:45 - Jack G;: “Keep calm and carry on” on the wall too
22/08/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: Yeah this has nailed everything
22/08/2019, 12:46 - Stefan;: Definitely. And if they live in London, a poster that says "When a man is tired of London, he's tired of life"
22/08/2019, 12:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, frequently hung in the house of someone desperate to move to the chilterns
22/08/2019, 12:46 - David;: Would give christmas presents still wrapped in the shop bought wrapping with very elaborate bows etc.?
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Hamish Sinclair: This is a pretty brutal character assassination on your collgeue tob
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Rob
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Rob;: Kate is 50 something and  wine of those 'purple women' - hair, clothes, bag, diary, computer mouse
22/08/2019, 12:47 - Rob;: She's my boss
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Rob;: She's very good at a lot of boss things, but someone I could never have much in common with on a personal level
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Sam;: What she needs is a good shaggin
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Rob;: Perhaps, Sambo
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Jack G;: Haha
22/08/2019, 12:48 - David;: Where would she go on holiday - always a generic med destination?
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Hamish Sinclair: 👍
22/08/2019, 12:48 - Jack G;: Benidorm?
22/08/2019, 12:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Corfu
22/08/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: If she wasn't childless and affluent, yes
22/08/2019, 12:50 - Jack G;: Tenerife then
22/08/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: But instead she's on a mission to do as much flying and meat eating as possible
22/08/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: In the last year: china, Costa Rica, Japan, Botswana, Florida, gran Canarian. Separate trips
22/08/2019, 12:52 - Jack G;: Decent
22/08/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: What is this kind of person?
22/08/2019, 13:12 - Paul;: And what shop has this
22/08/2019, 13:24 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 13:25 - Paul;: The Nokia ngog
22/08/2019, 13:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Bloy Blodgson
22/08/2019, 13:43 - Damian Rumble: This woman sounds like she has cracking taste in music though 🤩
22/08/2019, 13:46 - Sam;: RIP my brother Junior Agogo
22/08/2019, 14:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Now playing the macarena, is this bringing the music more inline with the itv/F1 girl?
22/08/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: Yeah, that she would lap up
22/08/2019, 14:32 - David;: Would I no predict a Botswana. But if would have been uxury safari-type trip?
22/08/2019, 14:33 - David;: When you get chocolates or perfume and they do a little shit pre-wrapping for you and then you would just hand it to the person like that.
22/08/2019, 14:34 - David;: Ah. Peak Hodgson. With the out of position Jonjo Shelvey at right wing. >Konchesky
22/08/2019, 14:35 - David;: His big signing along with an aging Joe Cole on a free with 90,000 a week wages
22/08/2019, 14:39 - Rob;: So her travel vibe is #holidayqueen, with the hashtag inserted into her out of office. A lavish lifestyle funded by timing (cheap flat now worth lots) and singledom ("didn't have a kid, had a life instead" - her catchphrase). Insane calculation of annual leave to stretch days off as much as possible. Coming into work directly from the airport after a long-haul flight etc. Lots of group tours of wonderful sites or things like safari (especially if she can eat  or ride the animals) with new people. No relaxing.
22/08/2019, 14:40 - Rob;: Takes 341 photos, hands around an iPad so everyone can view
22/08/2019, 14:41 - David;: I understand.
22/08/2019, 14:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Does she bring the lack of kids up in most conversations completely unpromted
22/08/2019, 14:42 - David;: "#holidayqueen, with the hashtag inserted into her out of office" - ah
22/08/2019, 14:42 - Rob;: Yes. All the time
22/08/2019, 14:43 - David;: "Insane calculation of annual leave to stretch days off as much as possible. " How is this enron-style accounting working? You can't get more days than the total.
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Hamish Sinclair: The 2 weeks in may between the bank holidays
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Or around easter
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Rob;: Buys an extra five, connects up the may bank holidays, never takes more than needed to account for rest or travel. That sort of thing
22/08/2019, 14:44 - Rob;: Will be running a meeting 2hrs after flying back from Bali etv
22/08/2019, 14:45 - David;: But it always amounts to the same total holiday days
22/08/2019, 14:46 - David;: Apart from the 5 she buys - what even is that policy as well?
22/08/2019, 14:46 - Rob;: A lot of companies let you buy or sell some
22/08/2019, 14:46 - Rob;: It does all add up to the same, but it doesn't feel like that
22/08/2019, 14:49 - Damian Rumble: Tbh this just sounds like a smart  way to make the most of your holidays to me
22/08/2019, 14:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, but annoying to work with someone who meticulously plans their leave around the bank holidays, as often you cant all be off at the same time
22/08/2019, 14:52 - Rob;: Yeah, and she's a stickler for people not being off at the same time
22/08/2019, 14:53 - Rob;: In principle it's fine, it's just another facet to her personality that makes her unfit for a rave-based call-out on Radio 6
22/08/2019, 14:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Gets her leave in 11months in advance
22/08/2019, 15:08 - David;: So are we doing the chilli?
22/08/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: I'm up for it. Friday or Sunday
22/08/2019, 15:16 - David;: Let's call it when we're there. Pasta on Friday, BBQ Saturday then either chilli or pizza on Sunday?
22/08/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: Chilli for lunch always an option
22/08/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: More than one meal in a day
22/08/2019, 15:33 - David;: Ah yeah. Game changer. Don't just have to eat thin sliced bread and anaemic ham for lunch every day.
22/08/2019, 15:33 - David;: Okay yes big chilli saturday lunch? Before the BBQ. really load up on meat and spice.
22/08/2019, 15:43 - Damian Rumble: Sounds like mind and body is going to be thoroughly blooted this weekend. I am not sure how Sam's anus will be able to deal with this...
22/08/2019, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 17:20 - Damian Rumble: Need to get me one of these called the psychonaut
22/08/2019, 18:50 - David;: Sound? I've got a Bluetooth add on for the Bose now. Any advances?
22/08/2019, 18:50 - David;: I also have the boombar
22/08/2019, 18:50 - Rob;: I have my Wonderboom with me, small, bluetooth waterproof, floats
22/08/2019, 18:50 - Rob;: One for the reservoir
22/08/2019, 18:51 - David;: Nah
22/08/2019, 18:52 - David;: I love how sound systems seem to assume a constant quest for boom
22/08/2019, 18:53 - David;: Boom is what everyone is looking for
22/08/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. Wouldn't touch a speaker without boom up front
22/08/2019, 18:58 - David;: Boom actually sounds awful. Droning, thudding boom
22/08/2019, 18:59 - David;: Opressive
22/08/2019, 18:59 - Rob;: Yeah, boom something you try to reduce
22/08/2019, 19:01 - David;: 'i like this track but I wish it was more boomy. It's too balanced - i can still pick out the tune'
22/08/2019, 19:04 - Paul;: Bring all the boom
22/08/2019, 19:18 - Sam;: Can anyone bring a laptop? I can log into sky so we can watch pool vs arse
22/08/2019, 19:25 - David;: But wifi ded
22/08/2019, 19:25 - David;: Muh wifi
22/08/2019, 19:25 - David;: When is it? We can watch it in that grotty pub in the town where we wanted the world cup final
22/08/2019, 19:37 - Damian Rumble: That was a pretty good pub tbh. Would recommend
22/08/2019, 19:50 - Phill: Will bring my Bose
22/08/2019, 20:32 - David;: Is that same as mine?
22/08/2019, 20:32 - David;: If so I won't bother
22/08/2019, 20:36 - Jack G;: Tether some 4G?
22/08/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: Maybe we can get some 12kb dual up?
22/08/2019, 20:41 - David;: Why would we theater a shitty laptop screen stream?!
22/08/2019, 20:41 - David;: This is madness
22/08/2019, 20:41 - David;: Just pub it
22/08/2019, 20:42 - Phill: No it's the little Bluetooth one that is portable
22/08/2019, 20:43 - David;: Ah yeah - that mirrors and improves upon the functionality of a boombar. The boombar has no purpose
22/08/2019, 20:45 - Paul;: How were you going to get hold of internet?
22/08/2019, 20:46 - Phill: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 20:46 - Phill: Why are we even discussing acquiring internet?
22/08/2019, 20:46 - David;: <Media omitted>
22/08/2019, 20:54 - Rob;: Record breaker
22/08/2019, 22:45 - David;: Rob do you have ticket to Ride?
22/08/2019, 22:46 - David;: Also has anyone got a footy?
22/08/2019, 22:46 - Rob;: I think you're gonna be sad
22/08/2019, 22:46 - Rob;: No, I borrowed it before
22/08/2019, 22:48 - David;: But rooooob
22/08/2019, 22:49 - Rob;: Do I nooo have a ticket
22/08/2019, 22:52 - David;: We should coordinate which offline playlists for Max coverage
22/08/2019, 22:53 - David;: E.g. I can do Chope, Gorrilaman
22/08/2019, 22:54 - Rob;: I have them all I think
22/08/2019, 23:11 - David;: Bring bedding
22/08/2019, 23:15 - David;: *linen
22/08/2019, 23:16 - Rob;: Sleeping bag and pillowcase fine?
22/08/2019, 23:16 - David;: 👍
22/08/2019, 23:16 - David;: Human rat suit also acceptable
22/08/2019, 23:42 - David;: Got digital radio for test match and footy coverage
23/08/2019, 08:33 - Jack G;: Just leaving
23/08/2019, 08:52 - David;: Just left
23/08/2019, 08:54 - Sam;: Just left
23/08/2019, 08:55 - David;: Now right
23/08/2019, 09:05 - Sam;: The tricount "Whales" is now accessible at the following address: http://tricount.com/fohlCUMIuZAWZNhNj
23/08/2019, 09:10 - Sam;: What car u got jack?
23/08/2019, 09:47 - Jack G;: Octavia

"Dave Coplin, founder of AI consultancy the Envisioners, also had a play with the system, inputting the first line of a classic joke: A man walks into a bar...

The suggestion from the AI was not what he was expecting: "...And ordered two pints of beer and two scotches. When he tried to pay the bill, he was confronted by two men - one of whom shouted "This is for Syria". The man was then left bleeding and stabbed in the throat".

28/08/2019, 09:08 - Rob;: It might be two if Bolton go too
28/08/2019, 09:17 - Rob;: Actually, I think it will just mean a team doesn't get relegated from the league instead

29/08/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: Ah
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Change rendered useless
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Ded for how long?
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Paul;: Unknown
29/08/2019, 16:35 - Jack G;: Pukki in Martial out
29/08/2019, 16:35 - David;: Made 2 changes.
29/08/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: Not sure it's worth paying 4 pants to get out a player I just got in
29/08/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: Four of my pants
29/08/2019, 16:36 - David;: All I'll say is that it's going to be one Haller a ride.
29/08/2019, 16:36 - Paul;: Not going to sacrifice an additional point
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Jack G;: Just had to take point hit to get rid on Martial
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Seems premature, .authorities only miss one game
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Paul;: Wait until update then see how long he’s out for
29/08/2019, 16:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Eagerly awaiting scan resulys
29/08/2019, 16:38 - Jack G;: Only need replacement to get a few extra points to make it back though, can’t rely on my bench to do any good atm
29/08/2019, 16:38 - David;: Nah it's a thigh - you don't come back from those
29/08/2019, 16:38 - Hamish Sinclair: But if your bench player can get 2, then your new signing needs 6 just to break even
29/08/2019, 16:39 - David;: Yes. But price Dynamics and team value to factor in as well
29/08/2019, 16:39 - Jack G;: Yeah martial will take a massive price hit
29/08/2019, 16:39 - Hamish Sinclair: True, but theres no definite info on this injury
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Rob;: Hopefully can make change one minute after the deadline before he has fallen in value - the are a lot of transfers in that will need to be cancelled out before he starts slipping
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Sam, what nuggets from the utd message  boards ?
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Paul;: Unlikely. People already made their changes
29/08/2019, 16:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Is this going to rush people into wildcards?
29/08/2019, 16:41 - Hamish Sinclair: International break coming up so could recover from minor tear in <4weeks
29/08/2019, 16:42 - Jack G;: This speeds up my route to de bruyne by a week as well
29/08/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Do I need sterling. Is there a master plan I can work on
29/08/2019, 16:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Sterling looks essential, but I will not be purchasing
29/08/2019, 16:44 - David;: I may be playing my wildcard in the int break
29/08/2019, 16:44 - David;: Reassess
29/08/2019, 16:44 - Jack G;: Pukki first on the team sheet?
29/08/2019, 16:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Do prices go down mid game week
29/08/2019, 16:44 - Hamish Sinclair: As in do I need to panic on martial now or will it only kick in next game week?
29/08/2019, 16:45 - David;: He will never play in a team I manage. And I've told that to the board.
29/08/2019, 16:46 - Jack G;: I’ve joined the bandwagon, had to be done
29/08/2019, 16:47 - David;: Yeah I read somewhere they happen at 1am. Maximum 0.1 up or down  a day. They have to cross a threshold of a certain amount of transfers to trigger it
29/08/2019, 16:48 - David;: *net transfers
29/08/2019, 16:48 - Hamish Sinclair: The mad rush to get your squad sorted by 1am
29/08/2019, 16:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Reckon martial will go down tonight
29/08/2019, 16:49 - Paul;: Martial not going anywhere
29/08/2019, 16:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Just a fleshwound
29/08/2019, 16:51 - Jack G;: You do need legs to football though
29/08/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: I don't think he will
29/08/2019, 16:52 - Rob;: Must have had loads of net transfer in up until just now. Has to override that
29/08/2019, 16:55 - Hamish Sinclair: It cant all be done on net though?
29/08/2019, 16:55 - Hamish Sinclair: How does a shot 4.0 defender who never plays deteriorate if noone had him in their team?
29/08/2019, 16:57 - Jack G;: Need damian to do some data mining
29/08/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Reading about it on Reddit - price changes thought to happen overnight, capped at 0.1 up or down, max 0.3 in a weeks
29/08/2019, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Is it based in absolute in/outs or on %change?
29/08/2019, 16:58 - Paul;: This is turning into mass hysteria. Martial is fine. No price changes
29/08/2019, 16:59 - Rob;: That is less clear, the thread I found doesn't think it's linear
29/08/2019, 17:05 - David;: For falls it can also be a % of ownership threshold
29/08/2019, 17:06 - David;: Net transfers - absolute for rises. Absolute or % of ownership whichever happens first for falls
29/08/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: You win some you lose some on price rises. I would say losing 4 points is maybe not worth saving 0.1 million
29/08/2019, 17:10 - Jack G;: You’ve got to think of the knock on as well though. You’d have to use your transfer next week on Martial rather than doing the one you’d planned to improve your team
29/08/2019, 20:30 - Phill: I go to the pub for a pint and this...
29/08/2019, 20:31 - Phill: <Media omitted>

29/08/2019, 22:38 - Phill: Jack, I'm just going to say. This is as good as it was 15 years ago. I'm having such a great time.
29/08/2019, 22:41 - Hamish Sinclair: What does Becca think of it?
29/08/2019, 22:46 - Damian Rumble: There's some good animal spirits on display here. Massive speculation followed by inevitable hubris. I'm happy to sit back and reap the rewards of my pre season research into De Bruyne. Assist machine.
29/08/2019, 22:46 - Damian Rumble: Definitely banking that wildcard for use later in the season
29/08/2019, 22:50 - Rob;: Research into international star and  former player of the year?
29/08/2019, 22:51 - Phill: She's down with it
29/08/2019, 22:52 - Paul;: Some innovative research there
29/08/2019, 22:54 - Phill: Paul, asmongold has as many viewers as Pyramid stage at glasto
29/08/2019, 22:54 - Phill: Process that.
29/08/2019, 22:54 - Paul;: That seems low

30/08/2019, 08:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Have you taken up another administrative role?
30/08/2019, 08:56 - Phill: I'm considering it
30/08/2019, 08:58 - Jack G;: The rep grinds, the profession grinds though - going to need to sink a lot of time into it
30/08/2019, 08:59 - Phill: Doing my professions as I level up
30/08/2019, 08:59 - Phill: But I sink a lot of time into watching shit on TV or watching YouTube anyway
30/08/2019, 09:02 - David;: 'the rep grinds'
30/08/2019, 09:03 - Damian Rumble: How will you have time for fantasy football
30/08/2019, 09:03 - David;: So using your holiday on a second job, essentially
30/08/2019, 09:04 - Jack G;: I can remember spending days killing owls for iron feathers to make my best in slot pre-gear.
30/08/2019, 09:05 - Phill: Yeah. The new economy has so little buying power at the moment so can't make loads of gold yet.
30/08/2019, 09:07 - David;: Any info on who are emerging as the big guilds etc.?

30/08/2019, 09:07 - Phill: Method will probably be top
30/08/2019, 09:08 - Phill: They are in retail
30/08/2019, 09:09 - David;: In retail?
30/08/2019, 09:09 - Phill: Current version of the game
30/08/2019, 09:12 - Jack G;: Bet Blizzard are peeved at how popular this is. Everyone basically saying that the changes made and development over the last 15 years are just shite
30/08/2019, 09:13 - David;: Yeah lol how did they fuck it all up?
30/08/2019, 09:13 - David;: Are the graphics better?
30/08/2019, 09:15 - Phill: Classic graphics are a bit better but purely because we use HDMI now not AVG on CRT monitors. No real changes to the games underlying graphics have been implemented.
30/08/2019, 09:16 - David;: Doesn't it just look a bit shart now?
30/08/2019, 09:16 - David;: Pretty old graphics engine now
30/08/2019, 09:16 - Phill: <Media omitted>
30/08/2019, 09:16 - Phill: You tell me?
30/08/2019, 09:18 - David;: Yeah quite cluncky
30/08/2019, 09:21 - David;: Will be amusing to me if Lukaku and Sanchez at inter suddenly look really dynamic and effective
30/08/2019, 09:34 - Sam;: I expect them to do well to be honest. Lukaku was sold due to system change. And if Sánchez does well it just means there’s more chance of a market developing for clubs wanting to buy him
30/08/2019, 09:58 - Rob;: In a web chat with an IT man called Christopher William Prog
30/08/2019, 09:59 - Rob;: He'll hate it when Christopher William Punk comes along
30/08/2019, 11:07 - Paul;: Oh look, martial hasn’t changed in price
30/08/2019, 12:24 - David;: total rent for Wales was £197, so about £33 each. If you stick that in the tricount we can square off.
30/08/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: I've put it in
30/08/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: However I think it's missing the chilli and chicken shop
30/08/2019, 12:28 - Paul;: I thought Sam added that?
30/08/2019, 12:29 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
30/08/2019, 12:29 - David;: Yeah I thought he put it in - was £50 for my chilli and Phil bought the chicken stuff.
30/08/2019, 12:30 - Paul;: Get sambo to input his version
30/08/2019, 12:30 - Rob;: Maybe Sambo just needs to go in and refresh, may not have uploaded the emtries
30/08/2019, 12:32 - David;: I dont even have this so just send me pic of the balances when it's been updated.
30/08/2019, 12:32 - Paul;: Mr Tembo
30/08/2019, 12:34 - David;: Just remembered my chilli shop included my 10 pack of old mout so male it £40 instead.
30/08/2019, 12:34 - David;: *make it

30/08/2019, 12:37 - Paul;: Ah mr tembo. We can just go for beers at some point
30/08/2019, 12:37 - David;: Sam and Rob can just buy me a pint at some point not point doing those as transfers.
30/08/2019, 12:38 - Rob;: Sure, cheers. Will remember as I also benefitted from some of your gin
30/08/2019, 12:38 - Sam;: So just Jack and Phil who MUST make payment to Dave by close of business today or face interest and charges
30/08/2019, 12:39 - Jack G;: Need deets
30/08/2019, 12:39 - David;: Yep and I'll do the transfer to Sarah today
30/08/2019, 12:39 - David;: 40-17-19, 31377809
30/08/2019, 12:40 - David;: Cheers - whenever
30/08/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Tricount is goat
30/08/2019, 12:41 - Jack G;: Will transfer when I get home later, need my card machine
30/08/2019, 12:43 - David;: No rush
30/08/2019, 12:43 - David;: Jack - Haller. I've bought heavily into Haller.
30/08/2019, 12:43 - David;: Must score?
30/08/2019, 12:44 - Jack G;: Yeah he’ll score. At home to Norwich
30/08/2019, 12:45 - David;: It's up to you to stop this pukki madness getting out of hand
30/08/2019, 12:46 - Jack G;: I’ve just brought a Pukki in though, wouldn’t mind a 3-1 win to us with a Pukki consolation
30/08/2019, 12:48 - David;: You've given yourself a conflict of interest
30/08/2019, 12:51 - Jack G;: Win win though. West Ham win or the Pukki show
30/08/2019, 12:51 - Paul;: The pukki show
30/08/2019, 12:52 - Paul;: Hi, nick rickler. Here for the pukki show
30/08/2019, 13:09 - David;: Nice little round trip to Kazakhstan for you there Sam
30/08/2019, 13:09 - David;: I hear it's nice this time of year
30/08/2019, 13:09 - Jack G;: You love to see it
30/08/2019, 13:09 - David;: You do. You do.
30/08/2019, 13:10 - David;: Europa League is the ultimate troll
30/08/2019, 13:10 - Rob;: Interesting how drawing worse teams isn't necessarily good because it usually correlates to more travel
30/08/2019, 13:11 - Rob;: Ie I wouldn't swap Arsenal's group for United's
30/08/2019, 13:12 - Rob;: The groups often look like a shortlist of stag do destinations
30/08/2019, 13:39 - Jack G;: More interested in air miles rather than quality of opposition
30/08/2019, 16:30 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
30/08/2019, 16:30 - Paul;: Jack. Do you have a rivalry with Stokes?
30/08/2019, 16:31 - Jack G;: Come on Ben, you can do better than spurs
30/08/2019, 17:00 - Jack G;: Just transferred the money Dave
30/08/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: How have I only just realised there are 12 groups in the Europa League. 12!
30/08/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: And then you have a bunch of yes dropping down from the champions League
30/08/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: What a ridiculous competition

31/08/2019, 10:09 - Rob;: Sam, Fantasy thinks Martial will return for the next round of fixtures, 14 Sept, is that what the club are saying?
31/08/2019, 10:27 - Sam;: Mike phelan wrote it on the changing room wall in shit so you can probably trust it
31/08/2019, 10:36 - Paul;: Perennial cunt Mike phelan
31/08/2019, 10:49 - David;: Best keep him - watch the value drain away
31/08/2019, 11:03 - Rob;: His value doesn't really matter much if he plays for me in the next match. I bought the boy to play, David
31/08/2019, 12:17 - David;: He runs from his knees

31/08/2019, 15:43 - David;: Haller
31/08/2019, 15:43 - David;: Haller a player
31/08/2019, 15:53 - Paul;: Jack, when’s lanzini going to unleash? You promised me great things
31/08/2019, 15:54 - Jack G;: He’s played well, he’s good for an assist or goal a game. Might get something second half
31/08/2019, 16:44 - Sam;: Dave I left a blue coat and a towel in Wales. What do?
31/08/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: Ah if it's a blue coat you're fucked
31/08/2019, 17:21 - Sam;: Yeah it is. Why am I fucked?
01/09/2019, 00:10 - Phill: Don't know how I've ended up on this page at midnight but lol.

02/09/2019, 11:12 - David;: Have alerted the authorities. Will get back to you.
02/09/2019, 11:18 - Sam;: lol. good. Rob still hasn't explained why the blue coat is fucked... surely still hanging on a coat peg right now?
02/09/2019, 11:19 - David;: If it was a red coat you would have been okay
02/09/2019, 11:26 - Rob;: It was just the colour being listed in the original  enquiry, made it seem more important than it was
02/09/2019, 11:28 - Sam;: a classic identifier surely? there's thousands of left behind coats up there.
02/09/2019, 13:02 - David;: Lol
02/09/2019, 13:03 - David;: Yeah colour a classic object identifier to be fair
02/09/2019, 13:03 - David;: Never goes out of fashion as a descriptor
02/09/2019, 13:43 - Rob;: I like that Mhki had to move to Italy because Sanchez did.
02/09/2019, 13:44 - Rob;: Like Potter and Voldemort, neither can live while the other survives. Their situations must always be mirrored
02/09/2019, 13:45 - David;: Potter had a better goals to game ratio though. Hib.

02/09/2019, 18:46 - Damian Rumble: Sounds intense
02/09/2019, 18:47 - Damian Rumble: Like there is no gameplay or objectives. You just have to learn to survive.
02/09/2019, 18:50 - Phill: Survival games are pretty standard. Rust. Reign of Kings.
02/09/2019, 18:50 - Phill: No objective other than to survive.

03/09/2019, 10:44 - David;: Obvious bollocks
03/09/2019, 10:45 - Sam;: Deep fake. Must have taken some powerful AI to produce that
03/09/2019, 10:56 - Rob;: The increasing margin size was a small indicator that high powered fakery had been used

03/09/2019, 15:49 - Damian Rumble: Hello another defection to the Lib Dems. Tories no longer have a majority.
03/09/2019, 15:57 - Damian Rumble: Timed perfectly in the middle of Boris' statement in the house. Maximum trolling. It's pretty much exactly like that scene from the 'thick of it' series 3.

03/09/2019, 22:23 - Damian Rumble: Is Boris really going sack these guys
03/09/2019, 22:24 - Jack G;: There won’t be a genny until they’ve passed this no deal legislation through
03/09/2019, 22:24 - Paul;: What are the opinion polls saying. Would a genny troll everything
03/09/2019, 22:25 - Damian Rumble: Labour 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, 8months of 2018. We want a Genny.

17/09/2019, 13:15 - David;: But isn't that because those issues are under-defined?
17/09/2019, 13:16 - David;: They said we can't pass judgement on this because it's outside the scope of formal constitutional law
17/09/2019, 13:19 - Stefan;: They said there are no manageable legal standards by which a court could judge the appropriate length of a prorogation. But the issue isn't the length itself, it's the PM's improper purpose/motive (to prevent parliamentary scrutiny). It's well established in constituonal law that govt can only use its powers for proper purposes
17/09/2019, 13:20 - Stefan;: If the English decision is right, PM could legally prorogue parliament for a year
17/09/2019, 13:21 - David;: Ok but what about where motives are mixed - i.e. he can credibly claim an incoming gov needs a queens speech but everyone know this also helps him re. Brexit
17/09/2019, 13:22 - Jack G;: I think the length of prorogation is an issue here, would normally be much shorter for a queens speech
17/09/2019, 13:23 - David;: Yes but that seems correct legally, but practical problems (passing budgets) and political problems (being seen to have no legislative agenda) are what stop this
17/09/2019, 13:23 - Stefan;: Still unlawful if one of the motives is improper
17/09/2019, 13:25 - Sam;: and they fuckin are davo!
17/09/2019, 13:26 - Stefan;: Pannick's point is that the length demonstrates the real and unlawful purpose. PM hasn't given an affidavit (as is usual in such cases) to explain his motives on oath.
17/09/2019, 13:26 - David;: So I cure cancer but a minor motivation for doing so was to get laid - i shouldn't be allowed to do that?
17/09/2019, 13:27 - David;: Keep cancer, you're saying
17/09/2019, 13:27 - Sam;: I ❤ cancer
17/09/2019, 13:28 - Stefan;: This would be a great line from the govt lawyers, you should write to them
17/09/2019, 13:28 - Stefan;: Anyway I'm going into court now to deal with repair bills from a minor car accident
17/09/2019, 13:29 - David;: Wig on?
17/09/2019, 13:29 - Stefan;: Case isn't important enough for wigs
17/09/2019, 13:33 - David;: Lord Briggs on fire, the defence is terrified.
17/09/2019, 13:41 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/09/2019, 14:52 - Jack G;: Lord Keen seems to be arguing that because politicians have historically been sneaky fucks with no reprimand, it’s unfair that they don’t get the same freedom
17/09/2019, 19:17 - / James Ball: Had to take a shit in the woods earlier lads. Wiped my arse with oak leaves. Dead squirrel for company. Interesting experience.
17/09/2019, 19:50 - Damian Rumble: On a Tuesday night?!?
17/09/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: Wouldn't choose oak leaves myself, if I had a choice that is
17/09/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: Loo paper first
17/09/2019, 19:51 - Rob;: Then perhaps the horse chestnut leaf
17/09/2019, 19:52 - Rob;: Wider, less crispy
17/09/2019, 19:55 - / James Ball: Was taking a walk looking for mushrooms and had a sudden urge to shit up a tree
17/09/2019, 19:55 - Rob;: Find any shrooms?

17/09/2019, 20:02 - Rob;: Ah
17/09/2019, 20:02 - Rob;: It started so well
17/09/2019, 20:59 - / James Ball: Tripping balls as your liver shuts down
17/09/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: Better than tripping liver as your balls shut down
17/09/2019, 21:02 - David;: Not always true. Found some in the highlands on a mountain a couple of weeks back. Also sometimes up in Wales
17/09/2019, 21:03 - Rob;: Different shrooms for different rooms
17/09/2019, 21:03 - David;: Changing shrooms
17/09/2019, 21:03 - Rob;: Beef steak mushrooms love a tree

19/09/2019, 09:15 - Rob;: Really went all in
19/09/2019, 09:17 - Sam;: Further down it shows he also did black face.
19/09/2019, 09:18 - Rob;: Would surely have been controversial at the time, him being a prime minister's son
19/09/2019, 09:20 - David;: Just never black up
19/09/2019, 09:20 - David;: Classic thing to avoid if in public life
19/09/2019, 09:25 - Rob;: And quite avoidable in normal life too
19/09/2019, 09:44 - David;: Remarkably common for something I've never seen anyone do
19/09/2019, 09:45 - Rob;: I think an Indian mate whited up to go as Hitler to a bad taste party I missed at uni

19/09/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: You would have to assume

19/09/2019, 18:36 - David;: Listening to radio 4 thing about it - talking about the black and white minstrel show shown prime time on Saturday night still running in 1978
19/09/2019, 18:36 - David;: And that's fine, that's the BBC
19/09/2019, 18:36 - Paul;: But wasn’t in high demand in 2001?

19/09/2019, 21:36 - Damian Rumble: The car actually came off worse than the bike though. A chunk of thier rear bumper fell off

22/09/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: Such a write-off season already
22/09/2019, 17:54 - David;: Emery out?
22/09/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: There is a break clause in his contract for the end of this season, unless things change I can see the club using it
22/09/2019, 17:56 - Rob;: But doubt it would happen mid-season
22/09/2019, 17:59 - David;: So they'd rather write off a season of development than pay off a little conty?
22/09/2019, 18:01 - Rob;: All depends on what manager you could get mid-season and if you think they're the person to take you forward
22/09/2019, 18:17 - Jack G;: I heard Mourinho is available
22/09/2019, 18:17 - Rob;: 3-2 now though Jack, Emery in

22/09/2019, 18:37 - Paul;: Lol that is a great little troll
22/09/2019, 18:38 - Paul;: The leagues been upended. Damian still shit though.
22/09/2019, 18:39 - Rob;: Well, Domo should get to 50 points, which might take him above Jack
22/09/2019, 18:39 - David;: Yeah yeah. Of course. I wanted that to happen
22/09/2019, 18:39 - Paul;: Phil got the gk sub with 10 points coming in
22/09/2019, 18:40 - Rob;: Yeah Phil's gonna boss the week
22/09/2019, 18:41 - Paul;: I’m working on a strategy of integrating Man City midfielder exposure
22/09/2019, 18:41 - Paul;: At least 2 weeks until it might be viable
22/09/2019, 18:42 - Rob;: Have loads of them so at least 2 will play?
22/09/2019, 18:42 - David;: Played my wildcard

22/09/2019, 18:42 - David;: Finally resolving the Che Adams question
22/09/2019, 18:42 - Rob;: What was the question?
22/09/2019, 18:43 - Phill: Lucky for you I got trolled by the Friday game as I was planning on captaining de bruyne
22/09/2019, 18:43 - David;: Che Adams. And the answer is Aguero
22/09/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: Seems like an upgrade, yes
22/09/2019, 18:44 - David;: This de bruyne fad won't last
22/09/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: What have you had to sacrifice to bring in aguero?
22/09/2019, 18:45 - Rob;: Former player of the year Kevin De Bruyne?
22/09/2019, 18:45 - Rob;: Tuna in de Bruyne, David
22/09/2019, 18:46 - Damian Rumble: Can't pick a good captain to save my life
22/09/2019, 18:46 - Damian Rumble: Also Liverpool's defence is letting me down big time
22/09/2019, 18:46 - Damian Rumble: Sold sterling this week. Desperate measures
22/09/2019, 18:47 - Paul;: Not picking the right Liverpool defender. DYOR
22/09/2019, 18:47 - Damian Rumble: Well they are still there because they are both goal machines
22/09/2019, 18:48 - David;: Robertson 3 bonus points still to roll in
22/09/2019, 18:48 - David;: Trent got booked as well
22/09/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: Probably cost him the bonuses. Double whammy
22/09/2019, 18:52 - David;: Mass exodus from Digne
22/09/2019, 18:52 - David;: Good to see
22/09/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: Not quite as bad as a booking and conceeding 8 goals though
22/09/2019, 18:53 - Paul;: He’s next to go
22/09/2019, 18:53 - Paul;: Lost confidence in him
22/09/2019, 18:54 - Damian Rumble: Lol
22/09/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: All flocking to Lundstram
22/09/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: The wolf in sheep's clothing
22/09/2019, 19:01 - David;: Hysteria.
22/09/2019, 19:01 - David;: Like the tulip mania.
22/09/2019, 19:01 - David;: No underlying value
22/09/2019, 19:02 - David;: Speculative madness
22/09/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: But David, he's lying about being a defender

22/09/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: And no one's noticed
22/09/2019, 19:35 - Phill: I hyped lindstram in Wales but no one listened. Who's laughing now.

24/09/2019, 00:24 - David;: Will be playing

24/09/2019, 00:26 - David;: What is the goose's motivation?
24/09/2019, 00:28 - Stefan;: You're given missions, such as "get on TV"
24/09/2019, 00:29 - David;: 'lowers the stakes' - that's what I need
24/09/2019, 00:29 - Stefan;: Unclear whether the goose has free will or is a hapless slave to the player's whims
24/09/2019, 00:31 - David;: I can play this on my new projector. The goose will be life-size.
24/09/2019, 08:04 - / James Ball: You basically waddle about and act like a bit of a dick. Good fun. There's a dedicated key for honking.
24/09/2019, 08:05 - Hamish Sinclair: A dedicated honking button would surely improve any game
24/09/2019, 09:07 - Damian Rumble: Is there a multiplayer mode? Think of the carnage
24/09/2019, 09:07 - Damian Rumble: Also your housemate has a strong mustache...
24/09/2019, 09:42 - / James Ball: Multigoose mode you mean
24/09/2019, 09:43 - David;: I need that
24/09/2019, 09:43 - David;: Should be default in all games

24/09/2019, 10:43 - Jack G;: Not a good start Boris
24/09/2019, 10:51 - Rob;: What does this mean for Boris?
24/09/2019, 10:52 - Jack G;: He’d surely have to resign in normal times
24/09/2019, 10:52 - David;: There is zero chance he will resign
24/09/2019, 10:53 - Jack G;: Queen Lizzy must be fuming
24/09/2019, 10:54 - Jack G;: The fact that the decision was unanimous is huge
24/09/2019, 10:57 - Paul;: So now we do get a genny?
24/09/2019, 11:00 - Jack G;: I think the opposition will want to wait until they’ve forced Boris to get an extension before a genny
24/09/2019, 11:00 - Paul;: Genny ASAP surely
24/09/2019, 11:18 - Damian Rumble: Boris ded
24/09/2019, 11:36 - / James Ball: Must go to a Genny. But the question is whether that happens before or after 31st October
24/09/2019, 11:38 - Paul;: ❤ a genny
24/09/2019, 11:38 - Paul;: Who to vote for
24/09/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: Quite a big monumental cock up
24/09/2019, 12:03 - Damian Rumble: I honestly feel that Boris' best move is to resign as pm. Instruct his stand in to extend article 50. Then run for leadership of the party again on the grounds of putting principles before party and lead to Tories to victory in a December general election.
24/09/2019, 12:16 - David;: Hell just bluster on
24/09/2019, 12:25 - Rob;: Overhearing some of Tesco's Brexit contingency planning
24/09/2019, 12:26 - Rob;: They're shitting themselves about it happening before Christmas

24/09/2019, 12:28 - Paul;: Got cows here
24/09/2019, 12:28 - David;: Would be good if the whole UK had to endure a Dickensian gruel-based Christmas
24/09/2019, 12:28 - David;: Instantly reduced to eating coal dust and spam
24/09/2019, 12:29 - Jack G;: You’d be in your element Dave, spaghetti and ketchup for all

24/09/2019, 21:48 - Jack G;: >imagine being a spurs fan
25/09/2019, 07:30 - Paul;: Surely labour not wanting a vote of no confidence just undermines them further and pisses off all their possible voters? I don’t get it
25/09/2019, 07:42 - Stefan;: They don't want parliament to be dissolved before 31 October
25/09/2019, 08:07 - Stefan;: If a no confidence vote passes now, it could lead to parliament being dissolved (if the opposition can't agree on a new PM/government)
25/09/2019, 10:56 - / James Ball: Difficult to convey that to daily mail readers though

26/09/2019, 10:12 - Damian Rumble: "In the resumed Commons session, the chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster [Gove] said: 'The automotive sector, who I met this week, confirmed that they were ready, the retail sector said they were ready.'

Three attendees at the relevant meeting in Coventry this week told the BBC this was not an accurate reflection of Monday's meeting with manufacturers. 

'I was at the meeting. There's no way that is the message he could have gone away with,' said one business leader. "
26/09/2019, 10:13 - Damian Rumble: Bullshit now legitimate form of government

26/09/2019, 10:58 - David;: So raab is clearly gay?
26/09/2019, 10:58 - David;: Seems obvious
26/09/2019, 10:59 - David;: But then rampantly socially conservative. Is no one picking up on this?
26/09/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: Raab does have a wife
26/09/2019, 11:04 - Rob;: But then so does Macron
26/09/2019, 12:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Gay icon I thought?
26/09/2019, 12:17 - Stefan;: More this, but in the "hot dad" sense rather than the Lady Gaga sense
26/09/2019, 12:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Are those the only 2 available categories?
26/09/2019, 12:19 - Hamish Sinclair: You're either Raab or lady gaga
26/09/2019, 12:20 - David;: Stefan how is David from bake off going down in the gay community?
26/09/2019, 12:25 - Rob;: Stefan does the gay community know about Macron?
26/09/2019, 12:35 - Stefan;: As in whether he's a closet case? Unknown. Although he did marry a fabulous older woman, so
26/09/2019, 12:39 - Rob;: It seems to be widely circulated in political circles
26/09/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: A friend of a friend was Theresa May's spokesman and said it was openly discussed
26/09/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Apparently the same in the EU, via Steve
26/09/2019, 14:14 - Damian Rumble: https://twitter.com/britainelects/status/1177208075792584704?s=08
26/09/2019, 14:14 - Damian Rumble: Lol conservative government unable to vote for thier own conference to go ahead. Maximum trolling
26/09/2019, 14:27 - / James Ball: It is pretty hilarious. A government with no lower forced to go on whilst just straight up lying
26/09/2019, 14:27 - / James Ball: No power*
26/09/2019, 14:33 - Jack G;: Has Boris actually won a vote yet?
26/09/2019, 14:49 - / James Ball: Just a little prorogation
26/09/2019, 14:50 - Jack G;: But that wasn’t a vote?
26/09/2019, 14:54 - Stefan;: He lost the vote on prorogation 11-0
26/09/2019, 15:02 - / James Ball: Ah
26/09/2019, 15:03 - / James Ball: Judges also not a vote
26/09/2019, 15:07 - / James Ball: So the only vote he's won wasn't a vote and was ruled unlawful and void
26/09/2019, 15:10 - Stefan;: I suppose technically the queen voted for his prorogation request, so he won that one
26/09/2019, 15:14 - Damian Rumble: Won a vote the total electorate was one and if she didn't vote for it she would be immediately de throned
26/09/2019, 15:40 - Rob;: 7?
26/09/2019, 15:42 - David;: Beach no paid
26/09/2019, 16:10 - Jack G;: Bercow now saying that 5th is the earliest possible date a genny could be held now. How has Dominic Cummings fucked up their politic strategy this badly?
26/09/2019, 17:07 - David;: He hasn't
26/09/2019, 17:07 - David;: Fits their narrative perfectly
26/09/2019, 17:09 - Jack G;: But they needed to force a genny before the extension deadline (18th October) but now there’s no chance the opposition would go for it as we’d default to no deal
26/09/2019, 17:09 - Jack G;: If Boris goes to a genny having requested an extension he’s in bother
26/09/2019, 17:11 - David;: I don't think he is - he just says 'i tried everything but parliament are frustrating the will of the people so you need to give me a majority.'
26/09/2019, 17:12 - David;: Express, Sun and Mail back him up with screechy betrayal stories
26/09/2019, 17:12 - David;: And he's home
26/09/2019, 17:12 - Jack G;: But he’s already said he’d rather be dead in a ditch than request an extention. He’s very hardline on it, would make him look like a right idiot
26/09/2019, 17:13 - David;: Turns the whole thing into a referendum on this parliament rather than his non-existent domestic agenda and lack of leadership or character.
26/09/2019, 17:13 - Stefan;: But polling suggests a big Brexit party boost if there's an election after an extension. It's polling on a hypothetical scenario so you have to be cautious, but I'm sure they'd gain at his expense
26/09/2019, 17:15 - Sam;: Not if the brexit means brexit crowd believe he did all he could but parliament blocked everything. Parliament vs the people. Bollocks obviously but that’s the play
26/09/2019, 17:15 - David;: I think he's done enough with the prorogation and betrayal bill language to firm up the brexit vote
26/09/2019, 17:15 - David;: Leavers will realise voting brexit party just makes it less likely and he will play up 'vote brexit get Corbyn l' fears
26/09/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: But how can we have our Brexit if we haven't finished our meat?
26/09/2019, 17:16 - David;: Basically, brexit vote is reasonably concentrated and remain vote is evenly splintered lib Dem/lab/green. That just structurally fucks everything
26/09/2019, 17:17 - Sam;: In other news, Richard Keogh is out   For the rest of the season after he and his teammates were injured in a pissed up car crash. Hard one to explain to the manager
26/09/2019, 17:17 - Sam;: Keogh is club captain
26/09/2019, 17:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, hes made it look like he tried
26/09/2019, 17:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Pretty sure they now consider him "their guy"
26/09/2019, 17:19 - David;: Yes - everything that lowers his appeal to us makes him more popular with cunts.
26/09/2019, 17:19 - Rob;: Corbyn has been absolutely perfect for the whole ruse too
26/09/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: Divisive and off-putting to huge numbers of potential Labour voters
26/09/2019, 17:21 - David;: Starmer in
26/09/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: The shagger
26/09/2019, 17:22 - Stefan;: I saw Keir Starmer and his son wandering around Hampstead heath, by the men's swimming ponds the other weekend
26/09/2019, 17:22 - Stefan;: He's actually quite short
26/09/2019, 17:23 - David;: Makes that sound very grotty
26/09/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: Calum's review of Keir Starmer having met him a few times:
26/09/2019, 17:57 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
26/09/2019, 17:59 - / James Ball: Keir "the cottager" Starmer
26/09/2019, 17:59 - David;: Who is he shagging?
26/09/2019, 17:59 - / James Ball: Gentlemen at the swimming baths by the sound of it
26/09/2019, 18:00 - Damian Rumble: I was home recently and had a depressing conversation with my parents. They are the typical west Oxfordshire remain voting Tories. They hate what the government is doing to the country but the threat of socialist Corbyn in government some how provides them with a mental block that stops them for voting for anyone other than the conservatives.
26/09/2019, 18:01 - / James Ball: Simple Damo, just don't let them out of the house to vote.
26/09/2019, 18:01 - Jack G;: Lib Dem surely
26/09/2019, 18:02 - Damian Rumble: Classic yellow Tory. Politically aligned to the lib Dems but to scared of the left to vote for them
26/09/2019, 18:02 - / James Ball: Your parents?
26/09/2019, 18:04 - Paul;: You are the embodiment of the Lib Dem’s. Maybe that’s what they fear. The horror before them
26/09/2019, 18:05 - Sam;: If we had just won the AV vote..

26/09/2019, 18:10 - Hamish Sinclair: 😞
26/09/2019, 18:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Damo can you clarify this for me - are lib dems proposing to just cancel brexit without any further vote/referendum?
26/09/2019, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Less likely to vote for Tiny feet
26/09/2019, 18:13 - David;: Classic. Tell them that they can have their own thoughts and the daily mail is not a neutral information source
26/09/2019, 18:19 - David;: Aquaint then with the principles of post-Keynesian analysis
26/09/2019, 18:28 - Rob;: Just exudes a huge womaniser vibe apparently. No concrete cheating
26/09/2019, 18:28 - David;: Weeeel
26/09/2019, 18:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Shagger
26/09/2019, 18:29 - David;: Finchy
26/09/2019, 18:29 - Damian Rumble: Our policy is to work with other parties to hold a people's vote before brexit happens. However, as there will likely be a general election before that date, we will campaign to cancel brexit if the people give us a mandate (by electing us to majority government).
26/09/2019, 18:30 - Hamish Sinclair: So using the geny as a proxy for a second referendum
26/09/2019, 18:31 - Damian Rumble: Yeah pretty much
26/09/2019, 18:32 - Damian Rumble: Presumably you get to vote for Lucas in Brighton. That's a pretty decent representative there
26/09/2019, 18:33 - Rob;: Sort of a, 'I'll give you a billion pounds if you can throw this ball over those mountains', sort of promise
26/09/2019, 18:35 - Paul;: Throw a shoe over the pub roof
26/09/2019, 18:38 - David;: Does it lower credibility to formulate policy on the premise that it will never be implemented?
26/09/2019, 18:39 - / James Ball: Torys doing a reasonable job of that already
26/09/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: I moved from Cameron to Corbyn's constituency. I'll only ever consider being represented by a party leader
26/09/2019, 18:49 - David;: What was his majjy at the genny?
26/09/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: 60.5% vote share, the seat's highest ever according to Wikipedia
26/09/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: 78.4% remain
26/09/2019, 18:52 - Rob;: In spite of Corbyn
26/09/2019, 18:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Used to have Lucas, moved so now have Peter Kyle
26/09/2019, 18:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Why settle for less

26/09/2019, 22:28 - David;: Just makes it seem like a troll
26/09/2019, 22:30 - Rob;: I quite like it
26/09/2019, 22:31 - Rob;: The annoyance of jt
26/09/2019, 22:38 - Rob;: Had a thought - all football transfers should be done via a tricount
26/09/2019, 22:38 - Rob;: So City just pay Bayern Munich £4.35 and that's that
26/09/2019, 22:53 - David;: It would be complicated when Munich picked up a personal Coutinho during their trip to Eurospar but put it through the tricount
26/09/2019, 22:57 - Rob;: I suppose Tevez and Mascherano were examples of that when they were just owned by that man who let them play for West Ham

27/09/2019, 09:31 - David;: You can't make tea pretentious.
27/09/2019, 09:32 - Rob;: Even normal teabags were a polymer blend until the plastics backlash last year
27/09/2019, 09:32 - Rob;: Some still are

27/09/2019, 09:33 - Rob;: And the whole think of recycling plastics into clothes (most football replica shirts are old bottles) is bollocks too - the fibres just leak out in the wash in a less collectable, more damaging way
27/09/2019, 09:33 - Rob;: Yorkshire tea can't guarantee their bags are plastic free yet
27/09/2019, 09:33 - Paul;: So recycling is just shit anyway?
27/09/2019, 09:33 - Rob;: Hoping to by the end of 2020
27/09/2019, 09:33 - Paul;: David plastic yarrow
27/09/2019, 09:34 - Rob;: Often yes, and more so since China stopped importing it
27/09/2019, 09:35 - Rob;: Nowhere else has a decent infrastructure
27/09/2019, 09:35 - Rob;: And because no one knows what can and can't go in recycling, at least 25% of it is contaminated
27/09/2019, 09:38 - Rob;: But worrying about plastics instead of climate change is like remembering to water the plants while your house is on fire

03/10/2019, 07:55 - Rob;: The Telegraph did this video of young Tories saying how much abuse they get and, death threats aside, all of it is so deserved. 'People say I'm not a ally of LGBT rights'

03/10/2019, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, as if that guy from liverpool isn't also revelling in how unique and different he is
03/10/2019, 08:13 - Rob;: They're unable to separate trolling from the way Tory policies make people feel
03/10/2019, 08:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah. As if a labour party activist door knocking around Surrey wouldn't get similar responses
03/10/2019, 08:31 - Stefan;: Lol "people assume I'm a racist, sexist homophobe" - maybe that's to do with the MPs and policies of the party you chose to join

03/10/2019, 13:56 - Paul;: Reminds me of the incompetence of that guy using a giant spoon in the lecture theatre to try and fling sweets but doing it under arm and them constantly flying backwards
03/10/2019, 13:59 - Rob;: I have such a huge yet partial memory of that
03/10/2019, 14:02 - Paul;: One of the most frustrating things to witness
03/10/2019, 14:10 - Rob;: Do you have any more context?
03/10/2019, 14:12 - Paul;: It was your tutor groups end of term talent show thing and throwing sweets via spoon meant to be used in catapult fashion was the grand finale. Can’t forget that
03/10/2019, 14:13 - Paul;: But time after time he scooped sweets behind him
03/10/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: Ah yeah
03/10/2019, 14:18 - Rob;: Who was it who scooped behind? Sean walker? Bunyan?
03/10/2019, 14:19 - Paul;: No that Stephen guy with epilepsy
03/10/2019, 14:34 - Rob;: Stephan Thresher
03/10/2019, 14:35 - Rob;: He's an exact character from the in betweeners - the guy in the wheelchair from the fashion show episode

04/10/2019, 08:59 - Rob;: That's a poppadom, I believe
04/10/2019, 08:59 - Rob;: But I think we should start asking for plates made of bread next time at the Indiam
04/10/2019, 09:00 - Rob;: I have not bought that shirt yet
04/10/2019, 09:17 - Paul;: But you should definitely buy it
04/10/2019, 09:25 - David;: Which shirt?
04/10/2019, 09:25 - Rob;: Arsenal's current away strip
04/10/2019, 09:26 - Rob;: Which is a homage to but not as good as an old kit called the bruised banana
04/10/2019, 09:28 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/10/2019, 09:32 - David;: Hamish didnt you use to have a scratch and sniff bananna t shirt
04/10/2019, 09:32 - David;: where it released a fake bananna smell if you scratched the bananna
04/10/2019, 09:49 - Damian Rumble: I actually quite like the one in the foreground
04/10/2019, 09:51 - David;: Is it known officially as the bruised bananna?
04/10/2019, 10:03 - Paul;: Yep official name
04/10/2019, 10:07 - Rob;: It was a fan given name for the original kit, co-opted by the marketing people at Adidas
04/10/2019, 11:48 - David;: The Pukki party's over
04/10/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Injured?

06/10/2019, 13:53 - David;: Didn't have a game this week so everyone still festering in the last defeat. Temmy fuming.
06/10/2019, 13:53 - David;: Invented a new breakfast - eggy crumpets instead of eggy bread. Scope.

07/10/2019, 16:04 - Rob;: My editor emailed him the question
07/10/2019, 16:04 - Rob;: He has a team, who are in part people who used to work here
07/10/2019, 16:05 - Rob;: I think he writes a decent amount of what we get back, because it contains mental phrases like 'gun in some raw garlic' and 'celebrating the delicious Ness if gnarly sausage meat'
07/10/2019, 16:07 - Phill: Gun in

09/10/2019, 11:55 - David;: Guaranteed you'll be shitting one way or another
09/10/2019, 11:55 - David;: That's the one independent variable.
09/10/2019, 11:56 - David;: Really there's no reason not to buy all the bog roll for your life now just to have it done.
09/10/2019, 11:58 - David;: So no fresh food?
09/10/2019, 11:58 - David;: Pot noodles only
09/10/2019, 11:59 - Rob;: It could actually be fun
09/10/2019, 11:59 - Rob;: Just need to think positively about it
09/10/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: Nothing in place for fresh food imports
09/10/2019, 12:00 - Paul;: No inspection point exists at Kent
09/10/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: Average delay for lorries at least 140 hours
09/10/2019, 12:01 - Rob;: Ha
09/10/2019, 12:01 - Paul;: Based on 2min extra inspection so likely to be much more than 140 hours
09/10/2019, 12:02 - Paul;: This is a logistic guy saying this who consults with the cabinet
09/10/2019, 12:02 - Rob;: I'll just wipe my arse with sovereignty, thanks
09/10/2019, 12:02 - Paul;: Says it’s all fucked and no infrastructure to deal with new import delays and regulations
09/10/2019, 12:03 - Paul;: I’ll be selling bog roll for a fiver
09/10/2019, 12:03 - Rob;: Per wipe
09/10/2019, 12:03 - Rob;: More expensive thank using money to wipe
09/10/2019, 12:04 - David;: But you'd still pay to avoid the sharp bite of a 5 pound note in your crack
09/10/2019, 12:04 - Rob;: If only we hadn't gone polymer
09/10/2019, 12:05 - David;: Yeah - if you're going to wipe with cash the old 20 notes would be the gold standard

09/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: I do sort of want all this to happen to 1. Prove it was a bad idea, and 2. Say I lived through it
09/10/2019, 12:08 - David;: 3. walk around with a shitty arse
09/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: Yeah, and there's no shame
09/10/2019, 12:09 - David;: Lol surely the uncle ben's packets are the least of your problems
09/10/2019, 12:09 - David;: will keep forever
09/10/2019, 12:09 - David;: Don't forsee a huge uncle ben's shortage
09/10/2019, 12:11 - Paul;: No I eat them for lunch each day so just thought I’d get bulk whilst I was at it
09/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: Think all food likely to be affected anyway. Supermarkets don’t tend to hold weeks and weeks of supplies
09/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: At least I’ll be shitting in glorious comfort
09/10/2019, 12:16 - David;: Shitting while Rome burns
09/10/2019, 12:18 - Paul;: We import an awful lot of food. Said we haven’t been self sufficient since 1860
09/10/2019, 12:18 - Paul;: Even long shelf life will be hoarded and gobbled
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: And we also rely on 'just in time' supply chains, stuff in the shops within a day of harvest etc, which will be hugely affected by even small delays
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Phill: Can someone repost that Greta tunberg coke meme
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Phill: Can't wait for the cliff edge
09/10/2019, 12:20 - Phill: My thirst will be quenched.
09/10/2019, 12:22 - Paul;: There was a fresh food importer there who said if any delay happens it will be worthless and rot
09/10/2019, 12:22 - Paul;: Because the supply chains are all just in time
09/10/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: At least 6 months of disruption to the supply chain  at most optimistic
09/10/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: Switzerland has 30 entry points with the EU and has 3-4 hour delays everyday. Haven’t been able to fix the issue even after 40 years
09/10/2019, 12:23 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
09/10/2019, 12:24 - David;: Lol.
09/10/2019, 12:25 - Stefan;: Yeah but I only want it to ruin the lives of the morons who have a hard-on for no deal
09/10/2019, 12:25 - Stefan;: Spare the rest of us
09/10/2019, 12:25 - David;: No I'm happy having my own life ruined to prove them wrong
09/10/2019, 12:26 - David;: I'm very eager to cut off my own nose to spite their face
09/10/2019, 12:26 - David;: Don't need my nose anyway.
09/10/2019, 12:38 - Rob;: Apparently we also important the chemicals we use to purify drinking water
09/10/2019, 13:04 - Rob;: Gems and precious metals are our 5th highest import, so I will be stockpiling those
09/10/2019, 13:22 - Paul;: Can’t wait for the cliff edge
09/10/2019, 13:22 - Paul;: I’m ready now
09/10/2019, 13:40 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I'd take that hit just to see farage standing in the smouldering ruins of Thanet offering a grovelling apology to disheveled masses of the brexit apocalypse
09/10/2019, 13:40 - Jack G;: Farage will move to the US as soon as no deal hits so that’s just a fantasy
09/10/2019, 13:41 - Rob;: It would all be someone else's fault
09/10/2019, 13:46 - Phill: You all seem to be ignoring the post no deal utopia we will be living in.
09/10/2019, 13:46 - Phill: It's inevitable.
09/10/2019, 13:46 - Phill: Brainwashed by the liberal elite to think no deal isn't the best thing that's going to happen to this country.

12/10/2019, 16:16 - David;: Didn't have to eat his weekly ration of fibre out of politeness
12/10/2019, 16:16 - Paul;: Did you shit out in the open mountainside. Doing a Radcliffe. Shamed. Fondling shit mid race
12/10/2019, 16:21 - Rob;: Different race
12/10/2019, 16:21 - Rob;: This was a shit minutes into an urban half I believe

12/10/2019, 16:21 - David;: No shitting on cader just pain
12/10/2019, 16:22 - Paul;: Shitting minutes into it?
12/10/2019, 16:27 - David;: Not minutes in at all. Was on mile 9
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: I thought Fay had to wait for you? Guess you RNA the whole thing together?
12/10/2019, 16:28 - David;: Intense stomache cramps. Confident it improved my time overall.
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: That's big discipline, that
12/10/2019, 16:28 - David;: Yeah we ran together so she waited.
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Rob;: I can never be fucked with that, if Julia wants to be slow, that's fine, but I'm not dropping pace
12/10/2019, 16:28 - Paul;: At the start line. Straight off to the shitter
12/10/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: I think Fay told me about it and she gave me the impression it was earlier
12/10/2019, 16:30 - Rob;: This is a biologist's autocorrect
13/10/2019, 09:32 - Rob;: It struck me this morning that if Carmel Essery's first baby follows in her footsteps, Carmel will be a grandma in the next year or so
13/10/2019, 09:46 - David;: So great granny at 48?
13/10/2019, 09:46 - Rob;: Yes

13/10/2019, 15:53 - Phill: Yeah yeah
13/10/2019, 17:25 - Sam;: Just watched Joker. Total mess
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Phill: On a scale of 1-butthurt?
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Damian Rumble: Loved the darkness
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Sam;: Butt devastation.
13/10/2019, 17:28 - Phill: Should I watch it electric?
13/10/2019, 17:30 - Sam;: Could easily be a stand alone film with no connection to the comic book origins. Actually quite shit. Hope there’s no sequels or prequels.
13/10/2019, 17:31 - Sam;: The most common piece of dialogue in the script must have been, (joker laughs).
13/10/2019, 17:34 - Phill: Well...he is...the...joker...so
13/10/2019, 17:35 - Sam;: For minutes at a time. Paid to watch that
13/10/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: I agree it's total shit. The only thing they got right was casting Joaquin Phoenix
13/10/2019, 17:38 - Rob;: It has so many plot points that are straight out of a Year 6 creative writing lesson
13/10/2019, 17:40 - Rob;: It's a skip fire of a film
13/10/2019, 17:40 - Paul;: So they’ve actually fucked it up?
13/10/2019, 17:41 - Sam;: Yeah, forgot to write a film. Just a series of ‘edgy’ scenes depicting mental breakdown.
13/10/2019, 17:43 - Rob;: And they go for this fauning 'well of only people with mental health problems were given proper help...' angle, which they completely undermine by also being very insensitive and one-dimensional about it
13/10/2019, 17:43 - Sam;: Also fucked up what time period it’s supposed to be set in. Charlie Chaplin on a the cinema. Electronic/Digital equipment in the hospital
13/10/2019, 17:44 - Paul;: I would assume go with the latest technology?
13/10/2019, 17:45 - Sam;: Nah, the Chaplin film dates in specifically. They show a famous scene
13/10/2019, 17:45 - Paul;: Couldn’t possibly be showing an older film in a more modern age?
13/10/2019, 17:47 - Paul;: What year is it?
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: They give all the TV broadcasts a late 60s early technicolour look
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Paul;: If I’m watching a film from 1962 it doesn’t mean I’m in 1962
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Rob;: To be fair to them, Gotham city isn't real
13/10/2019, 17:48 - Sam;: What?
13/10/2019, 17:49 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
13/10/2019, 17:49 - Rob;: Is that a specific Batman page?
13/10/2019, 17:50 - Paul;: https://screenrant.com/joker-movie-year-set-1981/
13/10/2019, 17:50 - Paul;: Specific non generic source
13/10/2019, 17:52 - Sam;: The fact that people needed to write articles about it says enough. If I was enjoying the film I probably wouldn’t have been thinking about when it’s supposed to be set
13/10/2019, 17:52 - Paul;: So Sam if you’re watching a film set now but they show a film from the 1930’s in a scene that would overrule the use of technology in the film and place it’s time period to the film they’re watching?
13/10/2019, 17:54 - Sam;: There’s other factors than the two I pointed out.
13/10/2019, 17:54 - Sam;: Cunt
13/10/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: From watching it, the time period of the film isn't obvious. The Chaplin film is made to feel current, and clashes with lots of other little moments

13/10/2019, 18:31 - David;: So Sam when we were listening to the white album in Wales were you convinced we were actually in the 1960s?
13/10/2019, 18:34 - Sam;: Film definitely make the Chaplin showing seem contemporary
13/10/2019, 18:36 - David;: What year was the dark Knight set?
13/10/2019, 18:37 - Sam;: It was set in the same era it was released. 21st century

14/10/2019, 20:00 - David;: Trent, Gomez - not interested
14/10/2019, 20:01 - Jack G;: Keane and Trippier though, honking on that
14/10/2019, 21:38 - Sam;: Was anyone else aware that Cheick Tioté died in 2017?
14/10/2019, 21:39 - Paul;: Tiote cheick you mean

17/10/2019, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: Then
17/10/2019, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: A shitty little deal
17/10/2019, 11:09 - Rob;: A deal the then?
17/10/2019, 11:10 - David;: Don't get your hopes DUP
17/10/2019, 11:11 - Rob;: How different truly is this deal from the one Boris said would turn us into a vassal state?
17/10/2019, 11:12 - David;: Key point is it just applies to NI which he doesnt give a fuck about
17/10/2019, 11:14 - Rob;: Could make Belfast into an interesting place. Potential financial refuge for UK-facing companies that ❤ EU/Petrol?
17/10/2019, 11:15 - David;: Also we can strike our own trade deals, which I know for you in particular Rob was a key concern
17/10/2019, 11:15 - Rob;: ❤ trade deals
17/10/2019, 11:15 - David;: I ❤ non-tariff barriers to trade
17/10/2019, 11:17 - Rob;: ❤ custom checks in the Irish Sea
17/10/2019, 11:18 - David;: we should have a froust on the ferry over with lots of contraband and highly regulated commercial goods in our possession
17/10/2019, 11:18 - David;: The phytosanitary froust
17/10/2019, 11:19 - Rob;: I would love that
17/10/2019, 11:21 - Rob;: Have loads of animals with us that were raised to higher welfare standards
17/10/2019, 11:22 - David;: 'I'm sorry officer but this small rucksack is in fact entirely filled with nematicides that I intend on re-exporting to a third country via an intermediary in Dublin'.
17/10/2019, 12:13 - Paul;: So they should have gone for Mays deal? They created Boris and now he’s trolling
17/10/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: He's just turned up late and tweaked the work of someone less popular than him, then passed it off as his own good idea
17/10/2019, 12:15 - / James Ball: Very Tory
17/10/2019, 12:15 - Rob;: Like those confident people who just say your joke louder than you did and make the whole room laugh
17/10/2019, 12:15 - Paul;: But everyone saying this is worse than mays deal?
17/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: So he’s actually made it shitter
17/10/2019, 12:16 - Paul;: Not a better good idea
17/10/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: I think the Brexity people like it more
17/10/2019, 12:20 - David;: Don't see how it gets through parly still
17/10/2019, 12:20 - Jack G;: Maybe if they attach a reffy
17/10/2019, 12:21 - Rob;: Yeah, it's heading towards another delay, isn't it?
17/10/2019, 12:21 - David;: Because he's gone harder Brexit - the remain-leaning Tories who he kicked out are unlikely to go for it and without them he doesnt have a Majy even with the DUP
17/10/2019, 12:22 - David;: I suppose labour rebels might tip it through
17/10/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: There's that sect of unionist-supporting Tories who won't vote for it if the DUP don't, so it could be quite a lot less popular in parliament than May's deal
17/10/2019, 12:24 - David;: I think in practice they won't give a fuck now they've got their cunt in Downing street
17/10/2019, 12:24 - Jack G;: I think Boris is probably hoping it fails anyway. Plays into his Parliament vs people ploy
17/10/2019, 12:26 - David;: True, heading for a large Boris majy because he's consolidated the cunt vote.
17/10/2019, 12:28 - Jack G;: Farage hating this deal is a spanner in the works though
17/10/2019, 12:29 - Jack G;: Think Boris would have to campaign on no deal to get the cunt vote
17/10/2019, 12:36 - Rob;: Could be great if Nigel splits the cunt vote
17/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: Question is if it's rejected does he campaign on no deal or on this deal
17/10/2019, 12:53 - Jack G;: Yeah that’s a tricky one because if he gets a majy campaigning on this deal you’d assume he’d be able to get it through Parliament. He can’t say he’d go no deal if the deal doesn’t pass so no dealers will gravitate towards Farage
17/10/2019, 12:55 - David;: yes campaigning on this deal risks splitting cunt vote again while campaigning on no deal risks pushing moderate tories towards the lib dems

17/10/2019, 17:53 - Damian Rumble: Just got power back on my phone. Feeling pretty nervous about this whole brexit thing. Junker saying he will not give a brexit extension might just scare enough labour MPs into backing the deal for it to squeek  through
17/10/2019, 17:54 - Damian Rumble: Even if it doesn't Johnson will be able to go to the country to see. This is my deal. Vote for me to see it done. Can't see labour bearing that...
17/10/2019, 18:03 - Jack G;: The worst thing is if Boris gets brexit done everyone will love him and we’ll all be eating Tory shit for the next 10 years
17/10/2019, 18:04 - David;: Yeah exactly
17/10/2019, 18:05 - Phill: Can't wait.
17/10/2019, 18:05 - David;: Labour should have voted for Mays deal and argued over the shape of the future relationship without handing them their little betrayal narrative
17/10/2019, 18:06 - Damian Rumble: I mean that would have been the ultimate betrayal for many labour voters and driven them into the arms of the lib dems
17/10/2019, 18:07 - Damian Rumble: But by not voting for it Boris will paint them as enemies of the people

18/10/2019, 08:44 - Rob;: I have literally just finished months of working on Christmas projects
18/10/2019, 08:45 - Rob;: Up for binning if off from here
18/10/2019, 08:45 - David;: But now you have to live it all again in real life
18/10/2019, 08:46 - David;: So you get about 6 months of Christmas?
18/10/2019, 08:47 - Rob;: Roughly
18/10/2019, 08:48 - Rob;: From now to November 1st are my least christmassy weeks of the period
18/10/2019, 08:49 - Rob;: Obviously the corporate, tacky elements of Christmas are worth avoiding, but in its basic form it's good: an increased chance of seeing friends, fires, over-eating and over-drinking become the norm, time off
18/10/2019, 08:49 - Rob;: It's the natural season of froust, if you want it
18/10/2019, 08:49 - Rob;: I believe John Lennon said that
18/10/2019, 08:50 - Jack G;: Ebenezer Yarrow
18/10/2019, 08:51 - Rob;: I have the 21st Dec onwards to fill with froust
18/10/2019, 08:51 - Rob;: There are a lot of holes in my belt I'd like to try out
18/10/2019, 08:52 - David;: The 12 days of froustmas
18/10/2019, 08:52 - David;: A sharttridge in a pear tree
18/10/2019, 08:55 - Paul;: I want to focus mainly on port, cheese and cocaine for this festive period
18/10/2019, 08:56 - Rob;: Gold, Frankincense and cocaine
18/10/2019, 08:57 - Rob;: Port, cheese and myrhh
18/10/2019, 08:59 - Damian Rumble: Its what the forth wise mine famously bought...
18/10/2019, 09:00 - Damian Rumble: "and for the baby Jesus I have bought a casket of Charlie, so he may become the blooted Messiah"
18/10/2019, 09:12 - David;: The 5th dynasty ruler of Egypt King Sahure recorded the earliest attested expedition to the land of Punt, modern day Horn of Africa particularly Somalia which brought back large quantities of myrrh, frankincense, malachite and electrum. Other products that were also brought back included wild animals, particularly cheetahs, the secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius), giraffes and Hamadryas baboons (which was sacred to the Ancient Egyptians), ebony, ivory and animal skins.
18/10/2019, 09:13 - David;: >the secretary bird
18/10/2019, 09:28 - Rob;: My secretary bird will call you with the details
18/10/2019, 09:29 - Paul;: Ah that’s ruined me
18/10/2019, 09:30 - Paul;: I’ll have my secretary bird book it for us
18/10/2019, 09:43 - Rob;: >having an affair with your secretary bird
18/10/2019, 09:54 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 09:55 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 10:04 - Rob;: Legs up to her arse
18/10/2019, 10:07 - Paul;: Very female Damian bird
18/10/2019, 10:09 - Rob;: A lot more chic that I imagine Damian as a bird
18/10/2019, 10:52 - Damian Rumble: I can only aspire to this bird...
18/10/2019, 11:13 - David;: Gyimah's out. Grievesy's out
18/10/2019, 11:15 - David;: DUP lobbying against
18/10/2019, 11:19 - Damian Rumble: Gyimah is a LD of course he is out
18/10/2019, 11:20 - Damian Rumble: It's the yellow bellyed labour MPs you've got to watch out for
18/10/2019, 11:21 - Jack G;: A lot of MPs realising this deal can just be used as a stepping stone to no deal
18/10/2019, 11:22 - Hamish Sinclair: With predominantly leave voting constituencies
18/10/2019, 11:24 - David;: Although even within leave seats labour voters are majority remain
18/10/2019, 11:26 - Damian Rumble: How so?
18/10/2019, 11:26 - Jack G;: The transition period I believe is only 6 months and needs to be extended if we haven’t agreed a new deal. This is just the withdrawal agreement
18/10/2019, 11:27 - Paul;: 2 years transition period
18/10/2019, 11:27 - Damian Rumble: Wasn't it until the end of 2020?
18/10/2019, 11:28 - Jack G;: Think it runs out 31/12/2020
18/10/2019, 11:28 - Jack G;: And if we want to extend that has to be done by July
18/10/2019, 11:29 - Paul;: One you have deal agreed you get 2 years before it becomes permanent so you can sort out all the infrastructure etc
18/10/2019, 11:30 - Paul;: Think that 2020 one relates to the original date in March
18/10/2019, 11:31 - Rob;: Really? I thought the 2020 date stood despite the extension
18/10/2019, 11:32 - Paul;: Hmmm dunno
18/10/2019, 12:27 - Paul;: YouGov snap poll
18/10/2019, 14:02 - Jack G;: Big day tomorrow. Rugby quarter finals, premier league is back, then a showdown in the commons
18/10/2019, 14:11 - Damian Rumble: I'm going to the march to parliament tomorrow. Will be literally outside ready to kick off if it goes through.
18/10/2019, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: If they vote no deal then he has to extend no?
18/10/2019, 14:13 - David;: He has to ask for one
18/10/2019, 14:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Would love to see it passed providing it goes back to a referendum
18/10/2019, 14:13 - Rob;: Election at the same time as extension request, right?
18/10/2019, 14:13 - David;: Juncker has indicated the EU will not approve it. However that may be simply political to put more pressure on mps and increase likelihood of it passing
18/10/2019, 14:13 - Rob;: Otherwise what cganges
18/10/2019, 14:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Gagging for a confirmatory referendum
18/10/2019, 14:15 - Jack G;: I think that has been taken out of context by the media. He simply said why would we need an extension, we have a deal
18/10/2019, 14:17 - Rob;: Yeah, it was a response to a question in a press scrum, rather than a formal statement
18/10/2019, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: Yeah it's not Junker's choice anyway. I'm sure messers Macron and Merkel would prefer an extension over a no deal
18/10/2019, 14:41 - David;: No he ruled it out quite explicitly - but yes not his choice it's the Council
18/10/2019, 14:54 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
18/10/2019, 14:59 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/10/2019, 15:09 - David;: Would be a great troll for Sinn Fein to suddenly take seats and vote it down then quit again.
18/10/2019, 15:09 - Jack G;: Surely they’d vote for it though as it makes Irish reunification more likely
18/10/2019, 19:48 - Paul;: His wife was furious when she found out he had been having an affair with his secretary bird
18/10/2019, 23:46 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50103450
18/10/2019, 23:47 - David;: Hib
19/10/2019, 08:15 - Damian Rumble: Just a small amount of rugby today then..
19/10/2019, 08:16 - Jack G;: Need to get off to a decent start and stop any thoughts of an Aussie win in their tracks
19/10/2019, 10:49 - Paul;: Liking the win then?
19/10/2019, 11:00 - David;: Make the ball round then get back to me
19/10/2019, 11:22 - Damian Rumble: Cracking win. Looking like we could be in with a chance for the world cup if we keep playing like that
19/10/2019, 12:17 - David;: All the people with yarmolenko getting trolled
19/10/2019, 12:18 - Jack G;: Could have predicted it. Played both matches for Ukraine
19/10/2019, 12:42 - Damian Rumble: Ireland looking really bad
19/10/2019, 12:43 - Phill: >all those smelly remainers outside parliament
19/10/2019, 12:44 - Damian Rumble: Heading down there after the match
19/10/2019, 12:44 - Damian Rumble: Remain or no deal
19/10/2019, 12:45 - Phill: Says a lot that you prioritised the Ireland New Zealand match above your politics
19/10/2019, 12:45 - Phill: Smelly fickle remainer
19/10/2019, 12:47 - Damian Rumble: Don't worry Phil. I'll be there for the votes later on.
19/10/2019, 12:48 - David;: Jaaack
19/10/2019, 12:55 - David;: Lanzini appears to be a heap of shit
19/10/2019, 12:55 - Paul;: I blame you entirely for that jack
19/10/2019, 12:56 - Paul;: Once more I listened to your advice and it yielded nothing but complete shit
19/10/2019, 12:59 - David;: Could just have fish and chips for lunch
19/10/2019, 13:02 - David;: 'feet are an important part of football' - Chris Sutton
19/10/2019, 13:37 - Rob;: Letwin has it say the wip

19/10/2019, 13:40 - Paul;: You’re the shittest at politics

19/10/2019, 14:50 - Jack G;: The ayes have it
19/10/2019, 14:52 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
19/10/2019, 14:55 - Phill: Lol Boris just saying he's not even going to bother seeking an extension
19/10/2019, 14:56 - Jack G;: Admitting he’s going to break the law, great move Boris
19/10/2019, 15:06 - Paul;: Why do they want a delay? What are they hoping to gain after so many other delays?
19/10/2019, 15:14 - David;: On the ball a lot, looking dangerous
19/10/2019, 15:15 - David;: This has just confirmed my opinion
19/10/2019, 15:16 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I'm entirely sure what this achieves. Just more time for Boris to win over support with possible ramifications for not send a letter
19/10/2019, 15:18 - David;: Hib. Spurs
19/10/2019, 15:19 - David;: They really have become a heap of shit
19/10/2019, 15:20 - Jack G;: Just the universe being restored to normal order
19/10/2019, 15:20 - David;: Yeah with west ham losing again as well
19/10/2019, 15:21 - Jack G;: Exactly
19/10/2019, 15:32 - David;: What's Webster?
19/10/2019, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Webster, 20m from bristol city I think. Better than Duffy, worse than dunk
19/10/2019, 15:37 - David;: Lol the centre back index
19/10/2019, 15:38 - David;: Ah. Moy
19/10/2019, 15:38 - David;: Oh Mooy god
19/10/2019, 16:23 - Phill: Does Swinson realise she's wearing union jack earrings?
19/10/2019, 18:28 - Paul;: Bets on with what boris does re sending a letter?
19/10/2019, 18:29 - Rob;: Writes it, but in his own shit
19/10/2019, 18:34 - Jack G;: He’ll get someone else to write it on his behalf
19/10/2019, 18:41 - David;: <Media omitted>

19/10/2019, 18:53 - David;: Scope
19/10/2019, 18:54 - Phill: Yeah looks great
19/10/2019, 18:55 - David;: Pizza dough so easy. Who knew
19/10/2019, 19:01 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
19/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Very rare not to have the ingredients in
19/10/2019, 22:29 - David;: Lol watching the Diego maradonna film.
19/10/2019, 22:29 - David;: He was completely absurd
19/10/2019, 23:44 - David;: Dat Watford goal. The quintessential 4-4-2 goals
20/10/2019, 09:00 - Phill: Big game today
20/10/2019, 09:00 - Phill: >poonited 1pt above the relegation zone

20/10/2019, 17:10 - Jack G;: Pointless
20/10/2019, 17:10 - Paul;: ❤ VAR
20/10/2019, 17:11 - Phill: Meh. It's not like we're playing a competitor.
20/10/2019, 17:12 - Paul;: Man U bribed the ref again
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Jack G;: Currently the equivalent of us getting hyped up for a match against spurs
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: I 💓 VAR
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: Obvious hand ball
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Obvious foul. Obvious handball
20/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: Exactly what VAR is there for
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Sam;: Never a foul
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Sure sure
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Sam;: Irrelevant anyway as his first touch was so heavy
20/10/2019, 17:15 - Hamish Sinclair: 🧐
20/10/2019, 17:15 - David;: Football ruined. Next
20/10/2019, 17:16 - Paul;: Liverpool 0 VAR 2
20/10/2019, 17:16 - Hamish Sinclair: No issue with VAR, just terrible refereeing
20/10/2019, 17:16 - Hamish Sinclair: An old school gripe if you will
20/10/2019, 18:20 - David;: Brandon Williams
20/10/2019, 18:20 - David;: Obviousky
20/10/2019, 18:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Great point that
20/10/2019, 18:24 - David;: Yeah. Great result given the performance and context
20/10/2019, 18:24 - David;: Could be crucial
20/10/2019, 19:15 - David;: https://youtu.be/zcNM0mph_b0
20/10/2019, 19:18 - David;: Refs got a couple of yellows to be giving out there. A caution or two
20/10/2019, 19:21 - Paul;: That knockout kick
20/10/2019, 19:22 - David;: Yeah lol at the ends, studs up full into the back

21/10/2019, 15:55 - Damian Rumble: The ultimate troll
21/10/2019, 15:58 - Jack G;: Don’t know what the government were expecting, he’s just following normal parliamentary procedure

21/10/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: The pinotphiles - a group of light wine lovers
21/10/2019, 20:30 - David;: Lol
21/10/2019, 20:30 - David;: The speedophiles
21/10/2019, 20:30 - David;: Men's swimwear association
21/10/2019, 20:31 - Rob;: The pedophiles. We're just really into feet
21/10/2019, 20:32 - David;: Ah, Robert. That's for mousset that
21/10/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: Not a fan of that
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: That looked very penno
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: The pennophiles
21/10/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Hi I’m a pennophile
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: Probably what the VAT team refer to themselves as
21/10/2019, 20:36 - David;: *VAR
21/10/2019, 20:38 - David;: What's the point of Xhaka really?
21/10/2019, 21:17 - David;: Basham, Baldock, Egan and Fleck
21/10/2019, 21:18 - David;: Very Rohl Dahl defence
21/10/2019, 21:26 - David;: Hmm Rob the Aubameyang hat trick I've been counting doesn't look imminent
21/10/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: I'm in need of that too
21/10/2019, 21:29 - David;: I'm mean you'd want a little mesut in this scenario
21/10/2019, 21:30 - David;: A world class playmaker who can unlock a defence
21/10/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: Best to let him rot
21/10/2019, 21:31 - David;: This is very Phil football manager strategy. Benching your best player out of spite
21/10/2019, 21:33 - Rob;: It's been a long road to get to this point, with Ozil contributing massively with his lack of application, but yeah, Emery has made it much worse than it needs to be
21/10/2019, 21:34 - Rob;: Not even putting him the squad is mad
21/10/2019, 21:34 - Rob;: Guess he would have been sold had anyone been interested
21/10/2019, 21:36 - David;: Yeah if you don't sell him you have to at least try to reintegrate even as a bench option surely
21/10/2019, 21:36 - David;: You're paying his wages either way
21/10/2019, 21:37 - Rob;: It's not like he wouldn't add something late on, even if he's not in your plans from the start
21/10/2019, 21:38 - Sam;: Isthmian top devision is level 8 on the pyramid, Witney and district premier division is level 13.
21/10/2019, 21:41 - David;: They could be there in 5 promotions
21/10/2019, 21:41 - David;: It galls me that my current team aren't on the pyramid. I just want to be at the bottom of a pyramid gazing up at the stars
21/10/2019, 21:42 - Paul;: You should sweep in and become manager. Your real life footy man
21/10/2019, 21:43 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/10/2019, 21:44 - David;: Our manager is a fat piece of shit. Temmy.
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Temmy
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Old tem
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Tembo
21/10/2019, 21:44 - David;: Tembo
21/10/2019, 21:44 - Paul;: Mr tembo
21/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: He's from the dark ages. His management is mainly based around shouting
21/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: And dying for the 3 points
21/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Does that not get you motivated to die?
21/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Are they suspicious of you as part of the intelligentsia?
21/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: We won 5-1 at the weekend when he wasn't there. Not a coincidence
21/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: Nah I'm the silky wide forward they've been craving. 2 assists at the weekend
21/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: You do the maths
21/10/2019, 21:56 - Paul;: Silky
21/10/2019, 21:57 - Paul;: Which footballer do they compare you to?
21/10/2019, 22:09 - David;: I would compare myself to a young xerdan shaqiri. Haven't seen anyone else making the comparison
21/10/2019, 22:16 - Rob;: Are you therefore the Messi of the Alps of the Cotswolds?
21/10/2019, 22:18 - David;: Yeah but playing in the Lothian east league
21/10/2019, 22:19 - David;: So the Messi of the Alps of the Cotswolds of east lothian
22/10/2019, 09:13 - Rob;: Bag of bags, king of kings
22/10/2019, 09:15 - Damian Rumble: Can't remember the last game week where my highest scoring player was a mid field clean sheet. What a cluster fuck
22/10/2019, 14:16 - Paul;: Could get a genny
22/10/2019, 14:16 - Paul;: A lovely Christmas genny
22/10/2019, 14:16 - Jack G;: Yeah seems inevitable now
22/10/2019, 15:11 - Damian Rumble: Yeah this vote today on timings has become a proxy for the meaningful vote
22/10/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: Who’s hoping for a genny
22/10/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: Get my genny ready
22/10/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
22/10/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: Like the world cup for politics
22/10/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Doesn't come round enough, even in recent times
22/10/2019, 17:10 - Damian Rumble: The biggest unknown is how the public will react to having brexit delayed. Will they punish to pm breaking his promise or will they go with his line that parliament has betrayed the 'will of the people'
22/10/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: I bet things come out even more divided that at present
22/10/2019, 17:12 - Rob;: 5 parties with identical numbers of MPs. You heard it here first
22/10/2019, 17:13 - Rob;: Leaving Plaid Cymru as the kingmakers
22/10/2019, 17:14 - Sam;: Fuck em. We’ve just got to battle the leave voters and get a 2nd ref. The people are the enemy of the people. Brown vs Brown.
22/10/2019, 17:18 - Rob;: Labour need to be brave and go for referendum in a direct and unqualified way, or the chance of that is nothing
22/10/2019, 17:18 - Jack G;: A single issue genny is such a shitstorm
22/10/2019, 17:19 - Jack G;: Would be great to have a genny and reffy at the same time
22/10/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: You could probably sweep some controversial shit underneath a big brexit promise
22/10/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: *WE'LL REMAIN IN THE EU*
*but Corbyn gets a crack on your missus
22/10/2019, 17:29 - David;: Like how the will of the people is used to justify stopping the people expressing their will again
22/10/2019, 17:30 - David;: That's essentially exactly what Johnson will do though. "Get Brexit Done". (By the way we're now Singapore.)
22/10/2019, 17:31 - Jack G;: Don’t forget selling the NHS to America
22/10/2019, 17:32 - Damian Rumble: Being an autocratic, highly deregulated, serviced based single party state has got to be a Tories wet dream...
22/10/2019, 17:34 - David;: Dont think tories are aware that Singapore's political economy revolves around state-owned enterprises and sovereign wealth funds. Haven't seen that detail mentioned very much.
22/10/2019, 17:34 - David;: And yes single party rule and cronyism
22/10/2019, 19:18 - Phill: D-d-d-dealll

22/10/2019, 19:20 - Jack G;: Next vote is the important one
22/10/2019, 19:21 - Phill: Why tho? This vote now means there will be this deal at some point, be it the 31st or later
22/10/2019, 19:21 - Jack G;: Boris has said he’ll pull the bill if they vote down the programme motion (next vote)
22/10/2019, 19:21 - Paul;: Majjy
22/10/2019, 19:22 - Phill: Nah he won't
22/10/2019, 19:22 - Paul;: Who’s suffering from the most butthurt in the thread at the moment?
22/10/2019, 19:22 - Phill: Damo is probably dead from it
22/10/2019, 19:23 - Phill: There's not enough sudocreme in the world
22/10/2019, 19:24 - Phill: I just realised that I have sustained a troll leave position for over 3 years now
22/10/2019, 19:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Oh I actually had just assumed you were vote leave
22/10/2019, 19:25 - Phill: Lol I voted remain and labour last 2 votes
22/10/2019, 19:26 - Jack G;: Phil the Corbynista
22/10/2019, 19:26 - Phill: It's just been a great little troll niche
22/10/2019, 19:27 - Paul;: Am I unlikely to get my genny now?
22/10/2019, 19:27 - Phill: No Genny. Full Boris term if he delivers Brexit.
22/10/2019, 19:29 - Phill: Would just vote green in the next Genny anyway unless Kier Starmer was labour leader.
22/10/2019, 19:34 - Jack G;: Government loss on programme motion then
22/10/2019, 19:34 - Jack G;: Boris will be butthurt he can’t ram the deal through in 3 days
22/10/2019, 19:37 - Paul;: No deal incoming
22/10/2019, 19:41 - Jack G;: Nah eu will give us an extension then a genny
22/10/2019, 19:42 - Paul;: Nah cliff edge imminent
22/10/2019, 19:47 - Paul;: Main point is everyone is loving the deal so that’s what we get now? Or they can still chuck it after debating it
22/10/2019, 19:48 - Jack G;: I think they don’t mind it but the want parliament to have a larger say in shaping the future relationship
22/10/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: What would happen in a genny? Labour destroyed?
22/10/2019, 20:04 - David;: Most likely
22/10/2019, 20:06 - David;: Surely they'll just go for short extension now 10-15 days to get the legy passes
22/10/2019, 20:06 - David;: *passed
22/10/2019, 20:07 - Paul;: The leggy
22/10/2019, 20:07 - David;: Yeah get legy passed ahead of genny to secure majy
22/10/2019, 20:07 - Damian Rumble: Butt levels remain nominal. Good to see a solid 322 MPs resisting the pm brexit tom-foolery
22/10/2019, 20:09 - Phill: Ju lost doe.
22/10/2019, 20:10 - Damian Rumble: A short technical extension would be most sensible for boris. Want but he will have to fight MPs every step of the way. It would be easier to get a long delay. Crush labour and then sail through any Brexit he wants with a large majority
22/10/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: Chances of EU trolling us and saying no extension?
22/10/2019, 20:15 - Jack G;: Highly unlikely. They wouldn’t want to be blamed for no deal
22/10/2019, 20:22 - Paul;: Why would they care
22/10/2019, 20:23 - David;: Dat German export industry to answer to
22/10/2019, 20:23 - David;: Dem interest groups
22/10/2019, 20:25 - David;: Dat domestic euroscepticism
22/10/2019, 20:25 - Paul;: If I was eu I’d be trolling
22/10/2019, 20:26 - David;: Are EU having a laugh?
22/10/2019, 21:04 - Paul;: Exit my brexit
22/10/2019, 21:06 - Phill: He's got a foot like an opposition amendment
23/10/2019, 14:09 - Damian Rumble: @447540496004 how butt hurt will be if the cliff edge gets pushed back until the end of Jan?
23/10/2019, 14:10 - David;: >'@447540496004'
23/10/2019, 14:25 - Rob;: How butt hurt will be
23/10/2019, 14:27 - Paul;: @447969894197 are you asking @447854020575 re @447770604623 re @447540496004 or just @447540496004 or via @447854020575 c/o @447540496004 ?
23/10/2019, 15:27 - Jack G;: He already let the cat out the bag. A three year troll so doubt he’d be butthurt
23/10/2019, 20:11 - David;: Lol seeing all stewart in Glasgow. Supporting band are very shit light American rock called the empty pockets
23/10/2019, 20:11 - David;: Very gervais/merchant band name

24/10/2019, 19:19 - Rob;: Apparently the reason he gets it cut like that even though he's a billionaire is because he's obsessed with Julius Caesar
24/10/2019, 19:19 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
24/10/2019, 19:21 - Rob;: So there you go, looks like a weird little McLovin gremlin because he styles himself on a Roman emperor
24/10/2019, 19:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Didnt george Osborne do a similar thing a few years back?
24/10/2019, 19:43 - Hamish Sinclair: https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/03/george-osborne-caesar-makeover-autumn-statement

25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: Seems so
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: So he still doesn't have a goal from open play
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: The second kick is brilliant
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: The first more him taking advance of bad keeping
25/10/2019, 12:08 - Rob;: But it will do the boy no end of good to have won the game for us
25/10/2019, 12:13 - David;: The boy pepe

25/10/2019, 20:06 - Rob;: Found out with 15 mins to spare
25/10/2019, 20:19 - David;: Lol Southampton fans leaving. 17 minutes played
25/10/2019, 20:27 - Phill: Tfw no goals or assists in a rout
25/10/2019, 20:28 - David;: Yeah maddison managing to stay well away from any goal involvement
25/10/2019, 20:28 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/10/2019, 20:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Fuck!
25/10/2019, 20:42 - Rob;: Like McGinn when Villa won 5-1
25/10/2019, 20:42 - Rob;: Impossible not to get more than 2 points as an attacker in that scenario
25/10/2019, 20:43 - David;: Still nothing on the grapevine from Maddison
25/10/2019, 20:43 - David;: No goals no assists
25/10/2019, 21:21 - David;: Southamptons next 2 games both against City
25/10/2019, 21:21 - David;: Good way to get your confidence back
25/10/2019, 21:22 - Paul;: Buy city bonds
25/10/2019, 21:26 - David;: Jack with his little Tielemans
25/10/2019, 21:37 - Jack G;: Just seen the result (seven). Quite the right Tielemans
25/10/2019, 21:39 - David;: Maddison still no assists no goals
25/10/2019, 21:40 - Paul;: Good to get the clean sheet though
25/10/2019, 21:40 - David;: Still not a result
25/10/2019, 21:41 - Jack G;: Surely losing by 7 at home should be automatic relegation
25/10/2019, 21:42 - Jack G;: Madison goal Dave
25/10/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Madison's square garden
25/10/2019, 21:43 - David;: Ah there he is
25/10/2019, 21:43 - David;: Just as I stopped watching I disgust
25/10/2019, 21:43 - Jack G;: Who assisted

25/10/2019, 22:18 - David;: You've done well out of that
25/10/2019, 22:18 - David;: One paltry goal from a 9-0 win.

27/10/2019, 18:19 - Jack G;: No idea how they’ve overturned that
27/10/2019, 18:24 - David;: It was a dangerous scoreline to get into
27/10/2019, 18:29 - David;: Lol guendouzi
27/10/2019, 18:29 - David;: No red for that
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: Seems lik goals are now presumed disallowed until proven innocent
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: This could be Emery gone perhaps
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Surely not midseason though?
27/10/2019, 18:54 - Paul;: Is moyes looking for a new job?
27/10/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: I do think our board are particularly passive and worried about change, but it seems like a situation that just won't get better. Hard to see what Emery's trying to do.
27/10/2019, 18:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Other than play as many young players as possible
27/10/2019, 18:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Who's out there as a replacement though?
27/10/2019, 18:56 - Rob;: Which has been about the only posistive
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Well Moyes is free, as Paul suggested
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: Yeah I don't think it's a good time to find a good manager, which probably means they won't do it
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: But this less fun than I think any point under Wenger
27/10/2019, 18:57 - Paul;: Would you like a moyes?

27/10/2019, 18:58 - David;: Big Sam's out of work still
27/10/2019, 18:58 - Rob;: Warnock. He'd make them all die for three points
27/10/2019, 18:58 - Jack G;: Do a Man U/Chelsea and give it to Ljungberg
27/10/2019, 18:58 - Rob;: Caretaker Freddie

27/10/2019, 19:00 - Rob;: I think Henry burn his bridges a bit when he turn down a coaching role because he didn't want to stop doing sky sports
27/10/2019, 19:01 - David;: Also his only managerial stint being a catastrophe?
27/10/2019, 19:01 - Rob;: We said 'whiel you work for us, could you not go on TV and slag us off' and he said, 'nah, the slagging off is very important to me'
27/10/2019, 19:01 - Rob;: Yes, that too

27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Yeh
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Big brain on him
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: But flightless
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: The penguin
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Paul;: ?
27/10/2019, 19:02 - Rob;: Ljungberg or Arteta probably the mostly likely ex players
27/10/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: He's the non-flying Dutchman Paul
27/10/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: Won't get on a plane
27/10/2019, 19:03 - Paul;: Not going to be an issue you won’t be playing in Europe
27/10/2019, 19:03 - Jack G;: Hib
27/10/2019, 19:04 - Rob;: It's extremely hard not to qualify for the europa league
27/10/2019, 19:04 - Rob;: I'd rather not
27/10/2019, 19:04 - Paul;: Screenshot that
27/10/2019, 19:15 - David;: I'd love to see Pulis work with this group of players
27/10/2019, 19:18 - David;: You're still 5th somehow
27/10/2019, 19:18 - David;: Maybe everything's fine
27/10/2019, 19:30 - Rob;: Yeah nothing's lost, Emery is just very hard to like
27/10/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: But you really want Wenger back
27/10/2019, 19:43 - David;: Is Wenger in work?
27/10/2019, 19:43 - David;: Didn't he get a big gig in japan
27/10/2019, 19:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Arteta surely your best bet
27/10/2019, 19:45 - David;: Wenger's groundbreaking contribution to the English game was telling the players not to gorge on chips and pies
27/10/2019, 19:46 - Paul;: Would everyone be on chips and pies still if not for him?
27/10/2019, 19:46 - David;: Yeah, they would never have been advised otherwise
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Rob;: Wenger has been writing his book and not managing
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Rob;: Japan or France if he gets another job I guess
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Paul;: Is it coming out on audible ?
27/10/2019, 19:47 - David;: Does he explain the no chip philosophy?
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Paul;: Read by him
27/10/2019, 19:47 - Rob;: I imagine it's all about Mars bars start to finish
27/10/2019, 19:48 - David;: I want massive detail about diet and habits of Parlour et al circa 1994
27/10/2019, 19:49 - David;: Volume of chips consumed etc.
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: I mean the shitty books by the players of that era have all that
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Paul;: What’s the shittest footy book you’ve read?
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: The Perry Groves book is where that 'I shagged her, then Merse shagged her, then I shagged her again, then Tony shagged' anecdote
27/10/2019, 19:49 - Rob;: Probably that one
27/10/2019, 19:50 - Rob;: I tried to read Jamie Vardy's after I got a free copy, but butter my arse it was shit
27/10/2019, 19:50 - David;: And the British Library and bodleon have to store a copy of that
27/10/2019, 19:50 - David;: By law
27/10/2019, 19:51 - Paul;: Lol the volume of other shit books they’ll have as well
27/10/2019, 19:51 - David;: Yeah all the Katie price books
27/10/2019, 19:51 - David;: More celeb bios than Plato and Aristotle combined, by far
27/10/2019, 19:52 - Rob;: There'll be a point of impossibility though surely, unless they dig down into the Earth's core to keep storing
27/10/2019, 19:52 - Rob;: Celeb books at the top, Greek philosophy at the bottom
27/10/2019, 19:52 - David;: They pretty much are they store it in a massive underground vault
27/10/2019, 19:54 - David;: Be good if the philosophy and science sections got wiped out in the nuclear war so we were left to rebuild only with the knowledge from celeb bios
27/10/2019, 19:54 - David;: The only section that was left intact
27/10/2019, 19:55 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
27/10/2019, 19:58 - Rob;: Learning to farm again from Paul Burrell's A ROYAL DUTY
27/10/2019, 20:10 - David;: Divining the principles of cosmology from Lee Howey's "Massively Violent and Decidedly Average"
28/10/2019, 08:57 - Paul;: Mark Lacey at the Star Trek convention
28/10/2019, 08:57 - Paul;: One thing I notice is they still use the same horrible background boards for the pictures that were used in the 80s
28/10/2019, 10:03 - Damian Rumble: Pics or it didn't happen
28/10/2019, 10:19 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 14:35 - / James Ball: I don't know who half of those people are
28/10/2019, 14:36 - Rob;: One of them is Mark Lacey in every photo so I know exactly 50%
28/10/2019, 14:39 - Damian Rumble: I am considering it to be very life affirming that I don't know these people
28/10/2019, 14:43 - Phill: He's definitely a pedo
28/10/2019, 15:06 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 15:07 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
28/10/2019, 15:14 - Paul;: Rob what abusing did you do to Ramsay and his family?
28/10/2019, 15:14 - Rob;: Never gave them a minute's rest
28/10/2019, 15:15 - Rob;: I personally called his mum a berk
28/10/2019, 15:15 - Paul;: Would you agree you’ve become toxic?
28/10/2019, 15:16 - Rob;: To an extent, yes. There are a lot of wankers in the crowd who get on players' backs too easily
28/10/2019, 15:17 - Rob;: I haven't been to a league game yet this season, only to cup wins, and those have been pretty laid back and fun, but the league games were often a bit edgy last season
28/10/2019, 15:18 - Jack G;: Sack Emery, Rafa in
28/10/2019, 15:22 - Paul;: You need the banana shirt if you’re to fix this
28/10/2019, 15:27 - David;: The bruised banana could have been a unifying moment
28/10/2019, 15:43 - Paul;: Also generating cash
28/10/2019, 20:31 - Paul;: What happens now
28/10/2019, 20:31 - Paul;: My genny
28/10/2019, 22:41 - / James Ball: Bojo finds a ditch and a razor blade?
29/10/2019, 07:16 - Rob;: Delicious https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-28/u-k-to-destroy-commemorative-50p-coins-in-brexit-meltdown
29/10/2019, 07:36 - Damian Rumble: Hubris
29/10/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Your little genny, Paul
29/10/2019, 11:44 - Jack G;: Christmas genny
29/10/2019, 11:45 - Paul;: Is it certain?
29/10/2019, 11:46 - Paul;: Labour want EU citizens to vote?!
29/10/2019, 11:47 - Rob;: Labour, Lib Dems, SNPs and Tories all want one and the next motion being tabled only needs 50% support not two thirds
29/10/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: EU citizens in Britain only obvs
29/10/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Not all 500,000
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Damian Rumble: Time to start planning the election night blootfest
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: *500,000,000
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Jack G;: Also they want 16 year olds to vote
29/10/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: It's the day after my work Christmas party. Going to be quite a gritty little vote
29/10/2019, 11:50 - Stefan;: The guardian is reporting that none of Labour's conditions are actually red lines for them
29/10/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Do 16 year olds actually have time to get registered, realistically
29/10/2019, 11:51 - Jack G;: Need about 3 weeks for registration? So they’d have to sort it soonish
29/10/2019, 11:52 - Rob;: Looks to be about 1.5 million of them. That is a lot of work
29/10/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: Surely it’s a mental idea?
29/10/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: How is that even a realistic idea to have EU people voting in the uk?
29/10/2019, 11:54 - Paul;: Do you just turn up on the day
29/10/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: A quick Google suggests it's about 3.5 million people (Incl children), which seems like quite a lot
29/10/2019, 11:57 - Rob;: So potential 5 million more votes than normal
29/10/2019, 11:59 - Paul;: They’ve run out of ideas
29/10/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: I think it's sensible to let this demographics have a say in Brexit, but the referendum would have been a much better time to introduce, when there was time to implement it
29/10/2019, 12:15 - Paul;: Why does everyone say December is complete madness?
29/10/2019, 12:15 - Paul;: What month do they want
29/10/2019, 12:19 - Damian Rumble: It's cold init
29/10/2019, 12:19 - Rob;: Normally they are held in late spring with the idea that favourable weather will boost turn out
29/10/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: And everyone's doing endless nativity plays in all of the village halls and primary schools that get used for poll stations
29/10/2019, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: The bodies of old, grey Tory voters will like up in the streets after they die from exposure whilst trying to vote
29/10/2019, 12:20 - Rob;: So many school plays you can't elect a government
29/10/2019, 12:21 - Stefan;: There's so many practical problems with a winter election
29/10/2019, 12:22 - Stefan;: Like polling staff having to sit for 16 hours in unheated churches and village halls
29/10/2019, 12:22 - Stefan;: Transporting ballot boxes across rural constituencies at night in ice/snow
29/10/2019, 12:23 - Stefan;: Also it'll lower turnout, which is more likely to hurt labour
29/10/2019, 12:23 - Rob;: And the school plays, Stefan
29/10/2019, 12:24 - Phill: Why is everyone so butthurt about the 12th of December but thirsting for the 9th?
29/10/2019, 12:24 - Damian Rumble: Throw the children bout on the cold winter streets I say. If you don't eat your meat how can you have your democracy?
29/10/2019, 12:27 - Rob;: Student vote. Apparently the 12 is just after they all go home, and they're more likely to be registered at uni
29/10/2019, 12:27 - Rob;: Which obviously doesn't worry the Tories at all
29/10/2019, 12:30 - Rob;: But why the students are apparently there on a Monday and gone by Thursday, I don't know
29/10/2019, 12:30 - Rob;: Term ends on a Friday, surely
29/10/2019, 12:36 - Stefan;: Some say the student vote would help Labour more in their parents' marginal constituencies than in university towns, which are mostly safe Labour seats already
29/10/2019, 12:37 - Stefan;: (That's if they're registered at home and actually vote)
29/10/2019, 12:37 - David;: Depends on demographics. If it's Al the frail old racists put off by the cold won't it weaken Tory vote?
29/10/2019, 12:37 - Sam;: Such fake news rob. Its to do with the 25 days of prorogument required in the run up to a genny.
29/10/2019, 12:39 - Damian Rumble: I imagine that when the students leave their campuses they will probably just retreat into thier parents houses for the winter and not bother voting at all
29/10/2019, 12:42 - David;: Genny is a perfect defroust though
29/10/2019, 12:42 - Stefan;: I think it's more than old people vote reliably out of habit, whereas younger people are more casual/less committed (so more likely not to bother if it's cold and dark)
29/10/2019, 12:43 - Stefan;: I'll be doing an all-night froust at the Hackney count in some cold sports hall
29/10/2019, 12:44 - David;: Go with a duvet and lots of Pringles and doughnuts
29/10/2019, 12:44 - David;: Just bed down
29/10/2019, 12:45 - Phill: This argument is so bullshit. If a party can't inspire people to go and vote then they don't deserve the vote. You can't be butthurt if Tory voters are more engaged in politics. Fucking engage if you so mad.
29/10/2019, 12:46 - David;: It's not lack of engagement it's that people that age have jobs, children, commitments vs retired people who sit on their arse all day just waiting for a genny. Election is a nice little outing for diedrie.
29/10/2019, 12:47 - David;: And have all day to do it, not rushing to get it in after work/school run etc.
29/10/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Which bit is fake news?
29/10/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Not the bit about nativity plays
29/10/2019, 12:58 - Phill: This is fake news. Polling stations open into the evening. If they bother to vote then don't moan.
29/10/2019, 12:58 - Phill: Don't bother*
29/10/2019, 13:00 - Sam;: The choice between the 9th or  12th of Dec that Phil asked about
29/10/2019, 13:04 - Damian Rumble: The irony of Phil willing people to engage in politics and simultaneously trolling anyone and everyone who publicly expresses and engagement in politics
29/10/2019, 13:08 - Rob;: I see. About the 9th not giving the government time to bring it's brexit deal back. I hadn't read that. Had conflated the choice with the general objection to that week of December as it's end of uni terms
29/10/2019, 13:10 - Sam;: Unacceptable
29/10/2019, 13:10 - Stefan;: Yeah they don't trust Johnson not to reintroduce his Brexit bill if parliament is prorogued a few days later
29/10/2019, 13:16 - Paul;: Still not a confirmed genny though
29/10/2019, 13:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Playing the youth team
29/10/2019, 13:36 - Hamish Sinclair: You dont win anything with kids
29/10/2019, 14:39 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 14:40 - Rob;: Islamic State loves Ed
29/10/2019, 14:58 - Paul;: Now the genny is in doubt?
29/10/2019, 14:58 - Paul;: Surely kill off parliament and bring in Damian’s utopian computer
29/10/2019, 15:29 - Damian Rumble: All hail Colossus
29/10/2019, 15:40 - Paul;: Is that still your dream for a perfect system of government?
29/10/2019, 15:41 - Rob;: Who programs the computer? Right-wingers, left-wingers or centralists?
29/10/2019, 15:41 - Jack G;: We need to build a computer that will programme the computer
29/10/2019, 15:42 - Damian Rumble: Ideally yes
29/10/2019, 15:42 - Paul;: Have you not heard this explained before. Damian programmes it
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Paul;: In his fair society he’s actually a dictator
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Rob;: Oh ok then. I see no problems. Go ahead Damian
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Damian Rumble: A benevolent dictator
29/10/2019, 15:43 - Paul;: Damo is the closet dictator hiding as a liberal dem
29/10/2019, 15:44 - Damian Rumble: The catch is that I capture my conciousness in a computer but have any the emotion removed in the process
29/10/2019, 15:45 - Rob;: Isn't that the concept of a Dalek?
29/10/2019, 16:38 - / James Ball: Lord Rumble shows no empathy. Lord Rumble knows only pain
29/10/2019, 16:41 - David;: So you are arguing working age families do not have any additional commitments than retirees?
29/10/2019, 16:44 - David;: E.g. you have a 9-5.30 job and a commute, you then have to cook dinner for 2 children and get them into bed. You then have an event in the evening, or have booked in a dinner or film, or are just knackered. That is going to make a differenc at the margin to your willingness to
29/10/2019, 16:46 - David;: rush to a polling station by 9.30 or whenever they close. So that disproportionately lowers turnout for those voters vs retired people with an identical level of political knowledge/commitment/engagement.
29/10/2019, 17:07 - Rob;: Why is voting never considered for a Saturday? Because people are more likely to be away from their constituency?
29/10/2019, 17:07 - Paul;: Votey via posty?
29/10/2019, 17:08 - Paul;: Surely that’s a solution
29/10/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: Yeah, but it's the people who were definitely going to find a vote anyway that benefits
29/10/2019, 17:09 - Rob;: I've organised a vote via proxy twice, which was pretty easy, but you've got to be quite politically motivated in the first place
29/10/2019, 17:13 - Paul;: So how would you do it to make it fair?
29/10/2019, 17:14 - Jack G;: Offer online voting
29/10/2019, 17:15 - Rob;: Or a morning off/late start to allow people to vote
29/10/2019, 17:15 - Paul;: But jack all the old people who can’t use computers or people who don’t have them
29/10/2019, 17:16 - Jack G;: Yes but they vote in person already. Online is an easier option for people that can’t do that for whatever reason
29/10/2019, 17:16 - / James Ball: Online voting a terrible idea. Ripe for abuse
29/10/2019, 17:16 - Jack G;: Would probably also increase voter turnout
29/10/2019, 17:16 - / James Ball: Russians
29/10/2019, 17:16 - David;: Banky on the genny?
29/10/2019, 17:17 - Paul;: All the people with their holidays booked though
29/10/2019, 17:17 - David;: Schedule it really late so they don't have time to book anything up. Last minute genny banky
29/10/2019, 17:18 - Paul;: If they’re not cancelling their film night they’re not cancelling their banky holly
29/10/2019, 17:19 - David;: You're not cancelling a cinny visit to trudge to a polling station. National banky only option
29/10/2019, 17:20 - Paul;: 16yr olds too busy playing compy games don’t know what the libs are hoping for
29/10/2019, 17:21 - / James Ball: Not sure opening up to 16 year olds will make much difference
29/10/2019, 17:22 - David;: 1.5m 16-18s though
29/10/2019, 17:22 - / James Ball: Best to cap it instead. If you're likely to die within the next two terms you can't vote
29/10/2019, 17:23 - David;: Vote weighting by years left to death
29/10/2019, 17:23 - David;: I.e. you're going to be effected less over your remaining life course by the decisions taken
29/10/2019, 17:23 - / James Ball: Will they be motivated enough to register and turn out in time? At best a few hundred k teens
29/10/2019, 17:23 - / James Ball: Exactly
29/10/2019, 17:24 - / James Ball: Use UK average life expectancy. Set some median year as central point. Say 35? Everything scales from there
29/10/2019, 17:25 - / James Ball: If your current age exceeds UK average life expectancy then your vote weight tends to 0
29/10/2019, 17:26 - David;: JS mill proposed you get an extra vote if you have a degree.
29/10/2019, 17:29 - / James Ball: He obviously foresaw the brexit deadlock
29/10/2019, 17:29 - Rob;: The person of the median age gets to decide on their own
29/10/2019, 17:31 - / James Ball: The perfect median election. Decided by one man in Clitheroe who happened to be the exact median age of everyone in the country.
29/10/2019, 17:31 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
29/10/2019, 17:31 - Rob;: Maybe The Independent Party for Change will get in that way
29/10/2019, 17:49 - David;: >the mace
29/10/2019, 19:12 - Phill: If you cared about these so called children, you would get your arse down the polly
29/10/2019, 20:08 - Paul;: Oh no love island is on. Can’t cancel. Couldn’t possibly vote. - these are also the people you wouldn’t want voting anyway
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: Not sure if anyone has watched bake off this year. I've only seen about 3 episodes. My take home is that the fridge girl has an incredible aura of parental oppression
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: No detectable personality beyond fringe
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Ah fringe girl
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Not fridge girl
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Phill: Fridge girl is all personality
29/10/2019, 20:19 - Rob;: Forced to be an athlete, and now seemingly forced to be in bake off
29/10/2019, 20:20 - Rob;: Ah yeah, WhatsApp though I couldn't mean fringe
29/10/2019, 20:20 - Paul;: Great British wank off
29/10/2019, 20:20 - Rob;: That's on after 9
29/10/2019, 20:22 - Phill: There was a long group discussion at work today about men pissing on women for kicks
29/10/2019, 20:22 - Phill: Simon in the corner goes "my Mrs prefers the brown"
29/10/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: Ah
29/10/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: Just ventures that
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Rob;: Were other people admitting giving golden showers?
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Phill: This is the same guy that once regailed us the story of the time his wife tried to rape him with a dildo
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Phill: No.
29/10/2019, 20:25 - Rob;: Right, so no one had laid any ground work for his to say it
29/10/2019, 20:26 - Phill: Nah it was just piss banter flying around
29/10/2019, 20:26 - Rob;: The old I was raped banter
29/10/2019, 20:27 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 20:27 - Paul;: >looks set
29/10/2019, 20:28 - Phill: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 20:28 - Rob;: 438 votes to 20
29/10/2019, 20:29 - Paul;: Can’t wait for this genny
29/10/2019, 20:29 - Paul;: Going to destroy labour
29/10/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: I think it could prove hilariously inconclusive
29/10/2019, 20:31 - Phill: I bet £10 on conservative majority
29/10/2019, 20:32 - Paul;: Conny majjy
29/10/2019, 20:32 - Paul;: Conny landslide
29/10/2019, 20:33 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Phill: Con BXP coalition. I like my brexits hard and fast.
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Stefan;: Tory lead isn't nearly as big as it was then
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Stefan;: That said, it's not a given that Labour will pull off the same turnaround as in 2017
29/10/2019, 20:34 - Paul;: Everyone’s done with labour
29/10/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: And Boris will do better than May
29/10/2019, 20:35 - David;: Destroy a party already out of office? Pretty weak already.
29/10/2019, 20:35 - David;: They are famously not the government
29/10/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Just whinging little pricks though
29/10/2019, 20:39 - Paul;: Crimbo genny
29/10/2019, 20:40 - Paul;: Couldn’t be better
29/10/2019, 20:40 - David;: Boring. Predictable.

29/10/2019, 21:21 - Paul;: Nah. Where does that hit
29/10/2019, 21:21 - David;: Not a goal
29/10/2019, 21:21 - Rob;: Lol, the huge troll of the opposition scoring directly from it too
29/10/2019, 21:27 - Damian Rumble: Best odds for Tory majjy is 10/11

29/10/2019, 21:29 - Phill: 10/11 is wank odds
29/10/2019, 21:31 - Damian Rumble: yeah that £10 is not going to stretch far
29/10/2019, 21:33 - Phill: My face when the Tories win and we get an immediate hard brexit and Jo Swinson has a breakdown in the house of commons when the liberal elite realises they did this to themselves

30/10/2019, 12:29 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/50229350
30/10/2019, 12:29 - David;: Lol this captaincy appointment
30/10/2019, 12:29 - David;: Very choice
30/10/2019, 12:39 - Rob;: Yeah, in juts a couple of weeks it went wrong in exactly the way that seemed obvious
30/10/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Don't appoint an unpopular player who suffers from lapses in concentration and moments of stupid aggression to be be your model of good judgement and commitment
30/10/2019, 12:44 - David;: Yeah just great how predictable it was and how instantly it has unravelled
30/10/2019, 12:44 - Rob;: Emery just not really getting things
30/10/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: Delaying the announcement of the captain, then saying he let the players vote on it
30/10/2019, 12:45 - David;: He seems somehow to be both very agressive and an extremely sensitive wallflower
30/10/2019, 12:45 - Rob;: Yeah
30/10/2019, 12:45 - David;: An unusual combination - thinned skinned agression
30/10/2019, 12:46 - Rob;: And it's not his fault he's picked every week and got made captain, but he just doesn't have the right qualities for either job
30/10/2019, 12:47 - Rob;: Apparently Emery doesn't fancy Torreira as he's not the 6ft hulk he'd preferred to has signed, but you'd have to think Guendouzi and Torreira would be better
30/10/2019, 12:48 - David;: Wasn't Torreira doing great last season? Why the sudden shunning
30/10/2019, 12:48 - David;: Thought he was the sucess story
30/10/2019, 12:49 - Rob;: Yep, loved him. Form dipped a bit later on, but everyone loves him
30/10/2019, 12:49 - Rob;: Mr Committment
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: Mr Dynamo
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: Mr Snappy Snap
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: But he's now exiled?
30/10/2019, 12:50 - Rob;: Yep, best to bench that
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: Get rid of that.
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: Along with Ozil
30/10/2019, 12:50 - David;: The Dynamo and the Butterfly
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: I half think Phil is managing Arsenal in the style of that Liverpool season he had on FM where he was making Torres rot
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: Ozil's reputation is possibly benefiting from not playing
30/10/2019, 12:51 - Rob;: In that he's become the answer
30/10/2019, 12:52 - David;: What's the logic behind not playing Torreira?
30/10/2019, 12:52 - Rob;: Whereas if he was coming on as sub or starting cup games, he might just be putting in the same ineffectual perfomances as before
30/10/2019, 12:53 - David;: Good to have as an option though. Unlike anyone else in your squad. Can unlock a defence
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Most people don't understand it. All I've read is that Emery has always used a really tall and dominant defensive midfielder and Torreira was scouted before Emery came in, so he doesn't like him much
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Exat
30/10/2019, 12:53 - Rob;: Exactly
30/10/2019, 12:54 - David;: Can't Guendouzi the galloping foal fulfil that role though - quite tall?
30/10/2019, 12:54 - David;: plus that hair is adding another few inches
30/10/2019, 13:06 - Rob;: Yes, and he has been our best player after Auba this year
30/10/2019, 13:06 - Rob;: So I would play him and Torreira
30/10/2019, 13:06 - Rob;: But Emery is a mad joke that has been sent to fuck shit up
30/10/2019, 13:18 - David;: Still can't speak English
30/10/2019, 13:25 - Damian Rumble: So trump is basically the captain of your team. Can't see that possibly going wrong...
30/10/2019, 13:32 - Rob;: But without the element of his use of shithouse techniques being in anyway effective
30/10/2019, 20:31 - Phill: https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7629757/Woman-31-identified-CAT-teenage-years.html
30/10/2019, 20:49 - David;: Little game on Rob
30/10/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Is Emery just trolling ozil by playing him in this team
30/10/2019, 20:54 - David;: How worried about Herby Kane's impact?
30/10/2019, 20:57 - Rob;: Harry Typo
30/10/2019, 20:57 - Paul;: Herby Kane
30/10/2019, 21:23 - Damian Rumble: 5-5
30/10/2019, 21:23 - Damian Rumble: What is football
30/10/2019, 21:26 - David;: 5⃣5⃣
30/10/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
30/10/2019, 21:44 - David;: I'd 5-5 (5-4 on pens) be an Arsenal fan right now
30/10/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: Thanks for winning by neither, Unai
30/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: Lol - quite a good prediction though to be fair. He was 2 mins out
30/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Rob are you butt devastated you scored 5 at anfield and still didn’t win
30/10/2019, 21:45 - Paul;: Has your butt experienced much worse frustration
30/10/2019, 21:45 - David;: Last time that happened to a team - must be talking decades
30/10/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Specifically Anfield or away?
30/10/2019, 21:46 - Paul;: Is your butt in fact hurting
30/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: Any team scoring 5 at anfield and not winning
30/10/2019, 21:46 - Rob;: As Reading scored 5 against us but lost to 7 goals exactly 7 years ago
30/10/2019, 21:46 - David;: A fairly rare occurance
30/10/2019, 21:46 - Rob;: Perhaps that has never happened yes
30/10/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: I am not overly butthurt - league cup, second teams and pens
30/10/2019, 21:47 - Paul;: If only you bought the banana shirt. None of this would have happened
30/10/2019, 21:47 - David;: Yeah was a great game. I would have been annoyed but understated to lose that
30/10/2019, 21:47 - David;: *undevestated
30/10/2019, 21:48 - Paul;: Good to get a little win though
30/10/2019, 21:49 - David;: Yeah yeah a great troll
30/10/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: I think losing the league cup final is the only point at which it feels as bad as losing a prem game really
30/10/2019, 21:50 - Rob;: Worse then, really
30/10/2019, 21:51 - Rob;: Martinelli 7 goals in 4 starts. Better than Messi and Ronaldo. Seems obvious now
30/10/2019, 21:53 - David;: But Dr pepe keeping him out of the team
30/10/2019, 21:53 - Rob;: Play on opposite wings
30/10/2019, 21:54 - Rob;: He's the Messi of the marginal cup fixtures
30/10/2019, 21:54 - David;: Good to have that messi
30/10/2019, 21:54 - David;: Not the actual one. I'd prefer that
30/10/2019, 21:54 - Rob;: /a flan
30/10/2019, 21:55 - David;: Would be good if Messi was awful I marginal cups. Couldn't buy a goal
30/10/2019, 21:55 - Rob;: I would love to see him go to an incredibly small club next, just to see if he could get them serial promotions
30/10/2019, 21:56 - Rob;: Off to Dulwich Hamlet
30/10/2019, 21:57 - David;: I always used to sign a washed up rivaldo on FM on a free for championship sides

30/10/2019, 22:12 - David;: Caxit
30/10/2019, 22:13 - Damian Rumble: Old news. That was announced about 6 months ago
30/10/2019, 22:13 - Damian Rumble: Shame alot of the moderate Tories are going. Going to miss Kenneth
30/10/2019, 22:21 - Stefan;: Damo why are they parachuting Sam Gymiah into Kensington where the pro-remain Labour MP has a majority of 20 votes over the Tories?
30/10/2019, 22:22 - David;: Yeah cunts
30/10/2019, 22:23 - David;: You're the reason we're going to get a hard brexit, as long as you accept that
30/10/2019, 22:23 - David;: and therefore dont moan when it happens
30/10/2019, 22:27 - Phill: Because they're thick as pick shit. Read: libtard.
30/10/2019, 22:27 - Phill: Pig shit*
30/10/2019, 22:28 - Phill: Damo explain why if quantum mechanics was real, and physics wasn't a lie, we can't have leave and remain at the same time?
30/10/2019, 22:37 - Damian Rumble: Yeah that one is a mystery to me. They have done that for a number of our other converts and I have seen some polling that suggests we would win well in a few specific places. I suspect the labour vote in Kensington has collapsed and that the pro remain Tories will happily vote for one of thier own even if he is actually running for another party.
30/10/2019, 22:41 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure I can tbh. I think to explain that I would first need to be able to explain how you can  simultaneously be a pro leave daily mail loving gammon and life time labour supporter who voted remain...
30/10/2019, 22:43 - David;: Schrodinger's troll
31/10/2019, 06:29 - Phill: 👍

31/10/2019, 08:42 - David;: It was between the wars of course
31/10/2019, 08:44 - David;: Ah we're actually too busy to play the quarter final Rob. Sorry about that. Something more important's come up.
31/10/2019, 08:48 - Rob;: Would the team you draw go into the semis, or would be get to play in your place if it can't be rearranged?
31/10/2019, 08:49 - Hamish Sinclair: I think the team we would play get a bye
31/10/2019, 09:08 - David;: Would make more sense for arsenal to play it surely?
31/10/2019, 09:08 - David;: Get the tie, tv revenues etc.
31/10/2019, 09:09 - Hamish Sinclair: But arsenal are no longer in the competition
31/10/2019, 09:09 - David;: But couldn't you read that as us forfeiting the match
31/10/2019, 09:10 - Hamish Sinclair: No we technically forfeit the next match.
31/10/2019, 09:10 - David;: I suppose
31/10/2019, 09:10 - Hamish Sinclair: We just played arsenal, we have a result for that game
31/10/2019, 09:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Next
31/10/2019, 09:19 - Rob;: Yeah I think it will be a bye for the next side
31/10/2019, 09:19 - Rob;: It would be problematic otherwise, say if we won and denied a team a European place
31/10/2019, 12:23 - Paul;: Phil are you looking forward to your socialist life under labour?
31/10/2019, 12:28 - David;: The 4 day week, more time to froust and play WoW
31/10/2019, 12:29 - Rob;: 4 day week would be amazing, I won't hear otherwise
31/10/2019, 12:30 - Paul;: Comrade Hastings
31/10/2019, 12:31 - Sam;: Yeah. The only debate should be which day to loose. Monday? Friday? The more controversial Wednesday to split the week up?
31/10/2019, 12:31 - David;: Got to Monday
31/10/2019, 12:31 - David;: So can really bed down into deep grot on saturday/sunday and still time to recover
31/10/2019, 12:32 - Sam;: Yeah. A reset day
31/10/2019, 12:32 - David;: Just to get back onto an even keel
31/10/2019, 12:32 - Sam;: Yeah, can’t tamper with the ‘friday feeling’
31/10/2019, 12:33 - David;: Then again, never facing more than a 2-day stint at a time would be appealing
31/10/2019, 12:33 - David;: The big Tuesday night
31/10/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: Agree, although wouldn't Thursday become the new Friday, in a more real sense than how people say it now
31/10/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: I'd vote to hill Monday though and everyone has to agree that day is just for chilling out. Don't be coming at me with plans
31/10/2019, 12:34 - Rob;: *kill
31/10/2019, 12:36 - David;: Would be good to be able to have a weekend away somewhere and then have a day to recover rather than straight into the week and not had time for the weekend reset
31/10/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Yeah, and rather than just increasing the weekend away to include of Monday so you feel just as tired
31/10/2019, 12:37 - Rob;: Respect the extra day
31/10/2019, 12:38 - Damian Rumble: The problem is that you need some good sport on a proper rest day. Monday is limited
31/10/2019, 12:38 - Damian Rumble: Wednesday day off exclusively for champions League
31/10/2019, 12:38 - Rob;: Damo, it's not like media companies wouldn't respond
31/10/2019, 12:39 - Rob;: We don't have a weekend because fun things happen then, the fun things were scheduled to happen at the weekend
31/10/2019, 12:40 - Rob;: Sorry, it's just endless repeats of homes under the hammer on the new third day if the weekend. Nothing we can do
31/10/2019, 12:40 - Sam;: Lol.
31/10/2019, 12:41 - Sam;: The weekend being created second. Hib
31/10/2019, 12:41 - Rob;: You know the fish and chip shop in chippy would remain closed, for sure
31/10/2019, 13:11 - Damian Rumble: Sorry guys. Bargain hunt have got a contract for Monday prime time slots up to 2026. No choice but to stick with that until
31/10/2019, 13:27 - David;: Lol. This got me
31/10/2019, 13:28 - David;: 'We can't work it out but all of the entertainment seems to always fall on these same two days, is there any way we can schedule public holidays to reflect this?'
31/10/2019, 13:31 - David;: 'Millions of people keep calling off sick, we're linking it to all of the great television and sport that is packed into Saturday and Sunday. But the formal days off are still falling on Monday and Tuesday can we just move this?'
31/10/2019, 13:43 - Rob;: A whole league system of football has developed, staffed and attended exclusively by people pulling sickies
31/10/2019, 13:43 - Rob;: It's ruining the economy
31/10/2019, 14:01 - Sam;: They don’t care if they loose their jobs! What do we do?!
31/10/2019, 14:01 - David;: Also the papers are producing bumper editions just on those weekdays.
31/10/2019, 14:02 - David;: It's like they're all encouraging it!
31/10/2019, 14:04 - Rob;: And there's so much more on at the cinema. It annoys me that I can't take my kids to see the latest children's films without taking time of work and them out of school

02/11/2019, 08:32 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
02/11/2019, 08:33 - Rob;: *down the whole
02/11/2019, 08:35 - Damian Rumble: Lol
02/11/2019, 08:36 - Paul;: Does F1 even have a final?
02/11/2019, 08:36 - Phill: Doesn't even have competition
02/11/2019, 08:36 - Jack G;: It does have basis in truth though. Look at the amount of respect the refs get from players. No drama
02/11/2019, 08:37 - Phill: Yeah football is a cunts sport.
02/11/2019, 08:37 - Phill: Love it, but it is for cunts.
02/11/2019, 08:38 - Phill: If Nigel Owens was a football ref he'd be abused relentlessly all match
02/11/2019, 08:39 - Rob;: Yeah, but there are other factors at play there. One goal is huge in football, a try isn't much in rugby, hence not as much incentive to bend rules. Rugby fans just don't need to be constantly projecting superiority because their sport is nicer to refs.
02/11/2019, 08:39 - Jack G;: >a try isn’t much in rugby
02/11/2019, 08:39 - Paul;: Not enough people care about the try
02/11/2019, 08:41 - Jack G;: South Africa have won their last 2 world cups without conceding or scoring a try in the final. Would have made a huge difference on either side
02/11/2019, 08:41 - Paul;: If anyone was watching
02/11/2019, 08:45 - Rob;: Only five matches in the whole world cup settled by a single try, they're worth less than goals in football
02/11/2019, 08:53 - David;: I prefer a flan
02/11/2019, 08:53 - Paul;: All agreed there’s no excuse for ever watching F1 at least
02/11/2019, 08:54 - David;: I'd only be interested I watching an interview with one of the engineers who built the car
02/11/2019, 08:54 - Jack G;: Yes, pointless
02/11/2019, 08:54 - Damian Rumble: > not watching your team compete in a world cup final because you think a try is worth too much
02/11/2019, 08:54 - David;: That determines who wins so the actual racing irrelevant
02/11/2019, 08:56 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
02/11/2019, 09:03 - Paul;: Anything on worth watching?
02/11/2019, 09:05 - David;: Robot wars at 10?
02/11/2019, 09:05 - Paul;: Now that was a programme
02/11/2019, 09:05 - Phill: Paul you go to live six Nations games
02/11/2019, 09:07 - Paul;: Never seen a live six nations game
02/11/2019, 09:07 - David;: Cricket, now that's a sport
02/11/2019, 09:07 - Phill: I went to watch a Wales game with you and Derek
02/11/2019, 09:08 - Paul;: Versus New Zealand
02/11/2019, 09:08 - Rob;: If England were in the robot wars final I would watch
02/11/2019, 09:08 - Phill: Runs not important.
02/11/2019, 09:09 - Damian Rumble: Sitting down for fives days and the result still being a draw. Now that's sport for you...
02/11/2019, 09:10 - Phill: >sitting down at the start of the F1 season knowing who's won already
02/11/2019, 09:10 - Paul;: >watching egg ball

02/11/2019, 09:38 - David;: Thankfully you're not missing anything because of it
02/11/2019, 09:38 - David;: Should be back up for the Bournemouth United game
02/11/2019, 09:39 - Rob;: One Christmas day at Rollright I'd just put the beef rib in to slow cook and got a call to say they would need to turn the power off until 3pm
02/11/2019, 09:39 - Damian Rumble: You should be able to stream the final one your phone I reckon
02/11/2019, 09:43 - Phill: >on my phone
02/11/2019, 09:43 - Phill: >not even 3g here
02/11/2019, 09:56 - Damian Rumble: First half over. No tries. Seems like the kind of game a single try might be decisive....
02/11/2019, 09:56 - David;: I imagine staring at a blank screen is more enjoyable than the match
02/11/2019, 10:52 - David;: Lol >England
02/11/2019, 10:53 - Jack G;: Thought you weren’t watching
02/11/2019, 10:53 - Damian Rumble: Fuck off
02/11/2019, 10:53 - Jack G;: 👍
02/11/2019, 10:54 - David;: Caught the second half. A shambles as expected.
02/11/2019, 10:55 - David;: What's the point of scrums and line  outs when they just throw it directly to their team.
02/11/2019, 10:56 - Phill: Like throw-ins?
02/11/2019, 10:57 - David;: You can contest a throw in.
02/11/2019, 10:57 - Phill: You can contest a line out
02/11/2019, 10:57 - David;: No, you stand vaguely alongside them as it is thrown directly to their player
02/11/2019, 10:58 - David;: Scrums. Go directly back toward your side. They never get turned over. Pointless.
02/11/2019, 10:58 - Phill: Contesting line outs and turning over scrums is how we beat new Zealand
02/11/2019, 10:58 - David;: Try and win the ball back you say? Penalty against you for that.
02/11/2019, 11:07 - Rob;: We're just leaving now
02/11/2019, 11:10 - Paul;: >
02/11/2019, 11:13 - David;: Thanks for letting us know we'll meet you there
02/11/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: Ah
02/11/2019, 11:34 - / James Ball: Just watched tomorrow's world from December 1979. A recap of the predictions from the 70s. One of the things that they were all surprised by was female presenters of the programme. No one could have guessed that happening. Flying cars - no problem.
02/11/2019, 11:34 - Rob;: Would you let my parents know?
02/11/2019, 11:37 - David;: What was the thing they got most wrong? Something they were very confident was just around the corner
02/11/2019, 11:38 - / James Ball: A lot of coverage of transport events. Concord, channel tunnel which, when built, would carry 50,000 passengers a day to France from the new "London Central" station.
02/11/2019, 11:39 - / James Ball: On mile long trains.
02/11/2019, 11:39 - / James Ball: Not totally wrong but different
02/11/2019, 11:40 - Paul;: Good to build a train so long it can’t actually move due to length so you just have to walk down it anyway to reach France
02/11/2019, 11:41 - Rob;: Yeah, a train simultaneously in London and Paris
02/11/2019, 11:41 - Paul;: In order to fit all those people they kept lengthening the train
02/11/2019, 11:42 - / James Ball: https://youtu.be/pYbRZmKsZsQ
02/11/2019, 11:43 - / James Ball: A lot of old fashioned numbers "a thousand million"
02/11/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: You could do that on the circle line and connect the front of the train with the back and just keep it moving around
02/11/2019, 11:43 - Rob;: Incredibly slowly
02/11/2019, 11:44 - Rob;: So before the American billion got adopted?
02/11/2019, 11:44 - Stefan;: So basically a massive circular version of an airport travelator
02/11/2019, 11:44 - / James Ball: yeah, they use the old long billion a few times as well
02/11/2019, 11:45 - / James Ball: 20:30 is basically the first use of the internet
02/11/2019, 11:46 - Rob;: Yes, but it takes you to work and makes you depressed instead of taking you to a holiday
02/11/2019, 11:50 - David;: Always on time though
02/11/2019, 11:52 - David;: After the Apollo missions everyone was confident a permanent moon base was a sure thing

02/11/2019, 20:19 - Paul;: All pallets?
02/11/2019, 20:30 - David;: You appear to be standing next to the buncefield pil depot
02/11/2019, 20:41 - / James Ball: Yeh
02/11/2019, 20:43 - / James Ball: Much burning. Local forest firework display. Guy next to me lit up a phat blunt when the fireworks went off
03/11/2019, 08:33 - Paul;: Just realised how disgusting the Man U away kit is. That’s why you lose games. If you don’t have a strong kit it demotivates the team
03/11/2019, 10:29 - Sam;: I hate it. Worse than the pink one last season
03/11/2019, 10:53 - Paul;: Need to change that if you’re to win
03/11/2019, 10:54 - David;: Solskjaer out?

03/11/2019, 11:02 - Sam;: Nah solkjaer in. We’re not arsenal fans.
03/11/2019, 11:05 - David;: True you've sacked 3 managers in the time they've sacked 1.
03/11/2019, 11:10 - Sam;: Woah woah woah. The board sack them, not the fans. I said we’re not like the arsenal fans.

03/11/2019, 20:02 - David;: Where?
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: I’m on it
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: Watching
03/11/2019, 20:03 - David;: You can't spring this on us out of the blue
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: Scope
03/11/2019, 20:03 - David;: Which channel?
03/11/2019, 20:03 - Paul;: Huge
03/11/2019, 20:05 - David;: Have they finally got it right not fucked it like the film
03/11/2019, 20:09 - Damian Rumble: What I time for my internet connection to go down...
03/11/2019, 20:11 - Sam;: BBC one
03/11/2019, 20:11 - Sam;: It’ll iPlayer as well though
03/11/2019, 20:12 - Sam;: 8 part series
03/11/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: Yeah I’m banging it through iplayer
03/11/2019, 20:14 - Paul;: The weasel looks like my cat

03/11/2019, 20:24 - Paul;: Damians daemon = goose
03/11/2019, 20:25 - Jack G;: Ah this could be big. Definitely will be watching
03/11/2019, 20:28 - Damian Rumble: Obviously
03/11/2019, 20:29 - Rob;: Dave = owl
03/11/2019, 20:47 - Paul;: Why’s that weasel changing colour?
03/11/2019, 20:50 - Rob;: Children's daemons can change form
03/11/2019, 20:51 - Paul;: Form?
03/11/2019, 20:51 - Paul;: A bit of colour?
03/11/2019, 20:55 - Paul;: 10/10 for dark mattys
03/11/2019, 20:58 - Rob;: In the book he takes lots of weasel like forms: pine marten, stoat etc. Basically the same thing
03/11/2019, 20:58 - Paul;: Ah right
03/11/2019, 20:58 - Paul;: Weasels about
03/11/2019, 21:00 - David;: What's the point?
03/11/2019, 21:00 - David;: May as well stay a weasel rather than morph into almost identical animals
03/11/2019, 21:14 - Sam;: He can do what he wants mate
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Paul;: With the goose you’d get the option of a duck?
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Paul;: But not a swan?
03/11/2019, 21:15 - Paul;: Can never upgrade?
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Rob;: They can literally be anything they want, but they tend to take forms that represent their child's character at most times
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Paul;: Well why not go lion all the time
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Rob;: Then settle on the thing that sort of represents them most
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Paul;: Poor daemon management
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Rob;: It's not really a choice
03/11/2019, 21:16 - Paul;: Thought you said can just become anything. Upgrade that weasel
03/11/2019, 21:17 - Paul;: Now get that weasel out of my sight
03/11/2019, 21:17 - Rob;: You'll probably see it become something better when required
03/11/2019, 21:17 - Rob;: I think if you really wanted it to settle as a lion you'd end up with something really shit
03/11/2019, 21:18 - Rob;: Ask for lion get wood louse
03/11/2019, 21:18 - Paul;: Jack asks for lion gets nematode
03/11/2019, 21:19 - Stefan;: This isn't like buying a pet or an attack dog
03/11/2019, 21:20 - Paul;: Very similar
03/11/2019, 21:21 - Damian Rumble: I remember in the book there are sailors for whom thier demons end up being fish so they can essentially never leave the sea
03/11/2019, 21:22 - Rob;: You'd think a stallion would be great until you buy a 3rd floor flat
03/11/2019, 21:23 - Paul;: A basking shark
03/11/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: A mole. Always needing to be near soil
03/11/2019, 21:32 - Damian Rumble: Sea anemone. Like what the hell would you do with that...
03/11/2019, 21:32 - Paul;: Lol
03/11/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Permanently stuck in shallow waters
03/11/2019, 21:35 - Rob;: Get a little tank for it
03/11/2019, 21:35 - Rob;: One of those gross stinking sloths would be shit
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Rob;: That's there on your wedding night
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Paul;: Lol a constant waft of shit
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Rob;: Someone in that world has had to take a flamingo to a funeral
03/11/2019, 21:36 - Paul;: Or an animal that goes into heat in a bad way
03/11/2019, 21:40 - Rob;: I don't think they'd copy a genuine animal's life cycle. They are just a facet of you
03/11/2019, 21:41 - Paul;: Do they know they’re a daemon or do they think humans are their things?
03/11/2019, 21:44 - Rob;: They know
03/11/2019, 22:05 - Sam;: Does he know?
04/11/2019, 11:52 - David;: https://www.thesun.co.uk/sport/football/10269880/lukaku-inter-scoring-record-ronaldo-serie-a/
04/11/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: Sambo, don’t you need a goal scorer?
04/11/2019, 11:55 - David;: Seem like they could really use a ronaldo- grade forward
04/11/2019, 12:15 - Sam;: Italian league is an easy league and he doesn’t fit the new style of football. He was never shit, hence his transfer fee to inter
04/11/2019, 12:19 - Jack G;: So United are shit?
04/11/2019, 12:20 - David;: Yeah I think that's the takeaway
04/11/2019, 12:20 - David;: Leves, instantly becomes world class
04/11/2019, 12:26 - David;: So Ronaldo is no good either? Can't be as currently playing in Italy. In fact does this mean Daniel James is better than Ronaldo?
04/11/2019, 12:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Famously difficult league to score in
04/11/2019, 12:27 - David;: "Serie A is regarded as one of the best football leagues in the world and it is often depicted as the most tactical national league.[2] Serie A was the world's second-strongest national league in 2014 according to IFFHS.[3] Serie A is ranked third among European leagues according to UEFA's league coefficient, behind La Liga and the Premier League, and ahead of the Bundesliga"
04/11/2019, 12:37 - Sam;: 2014 Dave. Great data 👍🏻
04/11/2019, 12:38 - Sam;: Straw man me all you want. Serie A is inferior to the premier league
04/11/2019, 15:05 - David;: Damian why haven't you investigated what's going on on Europa yet?
04/11/2019, 15:23 - Damian Rumble: Are you asking about the EU or the football league?
04/11/2019, 15:52 - David;: The jovian moon
04/11/2019, 16:17 - / James Ball: Which one?
04/11/2019, 16:18 - Rob;: Europa...
04/11/2019, 16:18 - Damian Rumble: Technically very difficult to land a probe on Europa. The moon orbits in the 'van Allen radiation belt' of Jupiter. Essentially ba region of space around the planet where damaging solar radiation particles get trapped. As a result anything electronic that spends more than hour or so on the surface will get fried. Flybe missions [of the moon] are the only one that are practical at the moment
04/11/2019, 16:20 - Damian Rumble: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Allen_radiation_belt
04/11/2019, 16:46 - David;: pop up a little shield
04/11/2019, 16:48 - Rob;: Great autocorrect. I didn't realise British commercial airline Flybe were running missions to Jupiter's moons
04/11/2019, 16:49 - Jack G;: No wonder so many airlines are going bust
04/11/2019, 16:50 - David;: Given that they can't get me from Birmingham to Edinburgh sucessfully I doubt they are going to Europa on the regular
04/11/2019, 16:51 - Stefan;: Fly Be To The Moon(s of Jupiter)

04/11/2019, 17:50 - Damian Rumble: Damo why are they parachuting Sam Gymiah into Kensington where the pro-remain Labour MP has a majority of 20 votes over the Tories?
04/11/2019, 17:51 - Damian Rumble: "We [https://www.bestforbritain.org/] have tried, wherever possible, to back the sitting MP with a strong voting record on Remain. One place we haven’t done this, Kensington, is because Labour is so far behind the Lib Dems that backing them could give the seat back to the Tories"

04/11/2019, 17:52 - Damian Rumble: In answer to your query @447752458076
04/11/2019, 17:55 - Damian Rumble: "There are London seats that the Conservatives won in 2017, and where the Labour party came second. But our polling shows clearly that in such places as the Cities of London and Westminster, Chelsea and Fulham, and Wimbledon, the Liberal Democrats are now the party best placed to unite an anti-Conservative vote with a clear Remain message. That analysis may be inconvenient to Labour but it is the product of cold, hard, recent data. "
04/11/2019, 18:20 - Jack G;: Gutted Bercow is going
04/11/2019, 18:21 - Hamish Sinclair: The polls so often predict so well

She had long been enduring acute pain, and the midwife, candle in hand, inspected her secret area, in order to ascertain if the child was coming. “Look also on the other side,” said the poor creature, “my husband has sometimes taken that road.”

04/11/2019, 20:46 - David;: Instructions: Heat sheep fat in a pot wide enough for the diced lamb to spread in one layer. Add lamb and sear on high heat until all moisture evaporates. Fold in the onion and keep cooking until it is almost transparent. Fold in salt, beetroot, rocket, fresh coriander, Persian shallot and cumin. Keep on folding until the moisture evaporates. Pour in beer, and then add water. Give the mixture a light stir and then bring to a boil. Reduce heat and add leek and garlic. Allow to simmer for about an hour until the sauce thickens.

Pound kurrat and remaining fresh coriander into a paste using a mortar and pestle. Ladle the stew into bowls and sprinkle with coriander seeds and kurrat and fresh coriander paste. The dish can be served with steamed bulgur, boiled chickpeas and bread.

The bones burn very well, and the paunch easily contains all the meat once it has been stripped off. In this way an ox, or any other sacrificial beast, is ingeniously made to boil itself."

13/11/2019, 16:08 - Damian Rumble: ... I think HQ are working on the basis that most of our votes to be won are from labour whilst ignoring the unfortunate side effect of that is the Tories wining power
13/11/2019, 16:09 - Rob;: So seeking power you won't be able to do anything with over the outcome you're actually campaigning for?
13/11/2019, 16:11 - Jack G;: I think the over aggressive anti labour strategy is going to massively backfire
13/11/2019, 16:12 - Damian Rumble: Well... back fire in that labour are too weak to defend against both us and the tories
13/11/2019, 16:13 - Jack G;: If you want to win labour votes you can’t be slagging them off and giving the impression that you’re assisting a Tory majority
13/11/2019, 16:20 - David;: Lol yeah
13/11/2019, 16:25 - Stefan;: I do think equally Labour need to show willingness to stand down in seats they can't win as part of a remain pact - their leadership are so dogmatic that they'll never even consider it
13/11/2019, 16:26 - Damian Rumble: There is no chance. Partially I don't think we want to open the door to a mass stand down like the brexit party did as that means less votes overall which means less press coverage and money for the next 5 years
13/11/2019, 16:27 - Jack G;: I think they’ve agreed not to campaign in a fair few con/lib marginals haven’t they?
13/11/2019, 16:27 - David;: Agree the awkward fact is that there aren't as many of those as vice versa - your St Ives etc.
13/11/2019, 16:28 - David;: Only a handful where labour is a very clear 3rd
13/11/2019, 16:42 - Jack G;: This whole situation could be avoided if we had a proper voting system
13/11/2019, 16:43 - Stefan;: Where did you hear this?
13/11/2019, 16:43 - Rob;: Imagine if people had cared as much about the AV referendum as the Brexit one
13/11/2019, 16:46 - Rob;: 'I'd rather be dead in a ditch than not have AV, but if no one votes for that my second vote is to be fine and in a pub'
13/11/2019, 16:47 - Jack G;: Local labour campaigner so could be fake news
13/11/2019, 16:56 - Damian Rumble: Which makes it all the more annoying that they won't budge. If labour withdrew 10 of our tory marginals and we from 10 of there's that would be Rob 20 seats from the Tories and any chance of them getting a majority
13/11/2019, 16:56 - Damian Rumble: *would rob them of 20 seats
13/11/2019, 16:57 - Damian Rumble: >Rob
13/11/2019, 16:57 - David;: Agree
13/11/2019, 16:57 - David;: But still reacting to that not happening in this way only has the practical effect of delivering a Tory majority
13/11/2019, 16:58 - Jack G;: Thing is though that gives the tories an easy attack line of “Lib Dems working with Corbyn” and con/lib swingers would run back to tories
13/11/2019, 16:59 - David;: Lol con/lib swingers
13/11/2019, 17:00 - Damian Rumble: This is a concern forsure
13/11/2019, 17:01 - David;: Yes it's true that there are lib Dem voters who would switch to cons rather than labour if a lib Dem stood down. Would need to decompose the lib vote to understand fully, which there is no data on at constituency level
13/11/2019, 17:05 - Damian Rumble: Personally I think such decisions should be taken at a local level based on local feelings for a local candidate and not reflect the national leadership (which is millstone round the labour parties neck)
13/11/2019, 17:16 - Paul;: Are there any labour supporters left in the north?
13/11/2019, 17:19 - David;: You can still find them
13/11/2019, 17:19 - David;: A handful
13/11/2019, 17:20 - Stefan;: YouGov found that of voters currently intending to vote LibDem, many more voted Labour in 2017 than Con
13/11/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: Let's just do away with all parties and MPs and instead hold a referendum on every single issue. Stop denying the will of the people
13/11/2019, 17:23 - Jack G;: Or the all powerful damo bot
13/11/2019, 17:23 - David;: So become Switzerland
13/11/2019, 17:24 - Rob;: Have a 4pm referendum every day. NHS yes. War no. Back in time for tea
13/11/2019, 17:25 - Paul;: The rumbletron. Just make it happen. I think it’s inevitable
13/11/2019, 17:25 - Rob;: I like that of all the humans we chose Damo
13/11/2019, 17:26 - Paul;: Choose the dictator
13/11/2019, 17:27 - David;: What if the rumbletrons algorithms choose a policy of abolishing itself?
13/11/2019, 17:27 - Rob;: I don't think Damo would ever give up power would he?
13/11/2019, 17:28 - Jack G;: It would just turn itself off and on again, pretend it never happened
13/11/2019, 17:28 - Paul;: No of course not
13/11/2019, 17:28 - Rob;: Would you, Damo?
13/11/2019, 17:29 - Paul;: The Lib Dem facade is a ruse
13/11/2019, 17:29 - Rob;: Or is their facade a ruse?
13/11/2019, 17:30 - Paul;: He’s slowly gathering data on us so he can start controlling the thread before uk wide roll out
13/11/2019, 17:30 - David;: A very shit ineffective ruse
13/11/2019, 17:31 - David;: Full voting rights for geese I assume
13/11/2019, 17:32 - Jack G;: Is voting required with the rumbletron in power?
13/11/2019, 17:32 - Paul;: No it makes decisions for you
13/11/2019, 17:33 - Paul;: It’s programmed by Damian
13/11/2019, 17:33 - Paul;: People are too stupid and don’t deserve to vote he argues, so instead he is left in charge of programming an algorithm that makes choices and that’s your vote
13/11/2019, 17:34 - Damian Rumble: I just willing and peacefully gave up control of my frisbee team... Does that count
13/11/2019, 17:35 - Damian Rumble: It's like the Chinese system. You can vote so we can call it a democracy but you can only vote for rumbletron
13/11/2019, 17:35 - David;: But the politburo of geese really pull the strings
13/11/2019, 18:06 - Paul;: Would rumbletron pick from the entire population of who best to “run” the country
13/11/2019, 18:06 - Paul;: From harvesting personality data
13/11/2019, 18:07 - Jack G;: Why have anyone? Just the supercomputer telling us what to do
13/11/2019, 18:07 - Jack G;: Skynet style
13/11/2019, 18:07 - Paul;: How do we communicate with rumbletron?
13/11/2019, 18:08 - David;: All you can do is pollute your data trail
13/11/2019, 18:08 - David;: In patterns which may point the algorithm I different directions
13/11/2019, 18:11 - Jack G;: Develop a rival supercomputer that outputs constructed data patterns to influence rumbletrons decisions
13/11/2019, 18:30 - Damian Rumble: Jeremy Corbyn, "no indyref2 in Labour's first term"... You have to wonder if this guys can hear himself speak some times...

18/11/2019, 16:37 - Rob;: Keep separate I think. Different memes

18/11/2019, 19:18 - David;: Only so many times you can hear the hey Jude outro extended to 10 minutes
18/11/2019, 19:19 - Stefan;: The Hey Jude cycle will go on forever until he dies or the festival closes (whichever is earlier)
18/11/2019, 19:20 - David;: Lol he does like to flog that particular horse
18/11/2019, 19:21 - David;: I don't know how it's attained the status of a huge classic - not even in top 10 Beatles tracks for me
18/11/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Is not the point of this article that You were "on point with your policies" 10 years ago, yet alienated a generation by going back on your biggest pledge. Digging up something from 10 years ago very relevant when the effects still felt today (wasnt jo swinson in the coalition government?)

18/11/2019, 21:24 - David;: Also their little tantrum over the debate. Like a child demanding to stay up past bed time when the adults have started talking.
18/11/2019, 21:27 - Paul;: >@447854020575
18/11/2019, 22:17 - Damian Rumble: I will happily put £100 on the lib Dems taking more seats off of the Tories (net) than Labour do.
19/11/2019, 01:18 - David;: Ammend this to include a) all of the additional seats they cause labour to lose that they would otherwise have held and b) the vulnerable Tory seats that are held by them due to splitting the anti-Tory vote - then yes I would take that. Otherwise it misses the point.
19/11/2019, 09:44 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
19/11/2019, 09:47 - Rob;: And that's Stefan throwing that United shade
19/11/2019, 09:47 - Stefan;: Lol
19/11/2019, 09:47 - Stefan;: Just got it from a friend
19/11/2019, 09:48 - Hamish Sinclair: I had to google the black eyed pea reference, imagine stefan had to do the same with the utd one?
19/11/2019, 09:52 - Stefan;: The Ferguson story was so much in the news that even I got it
19/11/2019, 09:54 - Rob;: Yeah a quarter of a century at the top gets you into popular culture
19/11/2019, 11:07 - David;: Lol. Et tu Stefan
19/11/2019, 14:32 - Damian Rumble: So I was curious to exactly how much of an effect this would be and to cut a long story short I got her ls of the data from 2017 and determined that in a) there are 7 seats at risk and b) there are 11 seats
19/11/2019, 14:34 - David;: Based on which assumptions?
19/11/2019, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: Of those I know we think we can win (or are at least trying hard to win) Southport, Kensington, Wimbledon, Westminster, Finchley/Folders green. There is also Canterbury which I believe we will field a paper candidate.

That leaves Portsmouth south, Bedford, Warwick and Warrington as your a) and Colchester, Truro, Putney, Watford, chipping Barnett, Camborne and reading west as your b)
19/11/2019, 14:43 - Damian Rumble: Firstly I look for constituencies where the total lib Dem vote is greater than the difference between labour and Tory vote. I dismiss any constituency where Lab or Con are not trying to win (vote percentage <25%) and any constituency where we are completely uncompetitive as we wouldn't ever bother campaigning (<5%)
19/11/2019, 14:43 - Damian Rumble: Finally I look at constituencies where the difference between lab/con is less than 15pts
19/11/2019, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: So total 11 constituencies where the lib Dems could potentially split the vote pointlessly leading to the Tories staying on. Not many
19/11/2019, 14:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Tories had a 10 seat majority last time round
19/11/2019, 14:45 - Rob;: But enough to more than replace the loss of the DUP as supply partners
19/11/2019, 14:46 - Damian Rumble: In this assumption I assumed we would win our high target seats off of the Tories so that 11 is not a net gain
19/11/2019, 14:48 - Hamish Sinclair: But the more people see of swinson the less they like her
19/11/2019, 15:09 - David;: I don't think this works. 2017 was a historic low lib Dem vote. So basing it on 2017 data doesn't map the phenomena under examination which is the effect of an increase in the lib dem vote. You'd have adjust that by e.g. applying a nation-wide swing based on current polling. Also cons could well be targeting constituencies with c.20% vote share last time around, under first past the post, precisely because they anticipate lib Dem remainers making them competitive I unlikely places.
19/11/2019, 15:09 - David;: And turnout dynamics
19/11/2019, 15:19 - Damian Rumble: Agreed. I am looking for somewhere I can get an up to date constituency by constituency dataset and revise this. Quite a lot of individual constituency pools show a big swing from labour to the lib Dems in some of our target seats but I'm not sure across the country
19/11/2019, 15:29 - David;: Yeah that's the problem with this election it's very constituency-specific which is hard to get good data on, hence all these MRPs. But they are also flawed based on which variables are included/excluded and given that the relationships between parameters are based on historical data so can change/break down
19/11/2019, 15:29 - David;: So no one knows essentially
19/11/2019, 15:31 - Jack G;: Who’s Raoul Moat
19/11/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: Lol

19/11/2019, 16:31 - / James Ball: "greeting from the krampus"
19/11/2019, 19:14 - Damian Rumble: So I dug up some MRP data from early November 2019. Under the same conditions this shows 156 seats at risk. 18% are predicted as a Tory hold (b) and 36% are predicted as a labour loss (a). (This does not include Scotland)

That being said this is just a model and I feel it is spreading support out rather widely where as the reality is a lot more constituency specific as you say.
19/11/2019, 19:23 - Phill: What makes you think labour and Tory are not fighting for every seat? What makes you think this is a normal election? What makes you think this a party election and not a Brexit election?
19/11/2019, 19:25 - Phill: What makes you think you can apply any sort of informed statistical analysis to an election that is unique within its context?
19/11/2019, 19:50 - Damian Rumble: Pochettino ded

19/11/2019, 20:37 - David;: Kane ded
19/11/2019, 20:38 - Rob;: No other manager will fancy Kane at all
19/11/2019, 20:38 - Rob;: Will cease to be able for sure
19/11/2019, 20:39 - Paul;: They’ll write him off straight away?
19/11/2019, 20:40 - Rob;: Hard to see another outcome
19/11/2019, 20:41 - Paul;: Because of the phrase Kane is not able?
19/11/2019, 20:42 - Paul;: They’re unlikely to have heard of him before so will base it off that
19/11/2019, 20:43 - Rob;: Yeah. They'll just see him as a Poch loyalist promoted above his station under the old regime, I'd imagine
19/11/2019, 20:43 - David;: Dropped by the weekend

19/11/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: During the debate the Tory press office Twitter account rebranded itself as 'FactcheckUK' then just said everything Corbyn said was a lie and that Boris was telling the truth. Seems like quite a childish strategy

20/11/2019, 07:43 - Rob;: Spurs fan I sit next to just text me 'This will kill Spurs'
20/11/2019, 07:46 - Jack G;: I wonder how Levy persuaded Mourinho to join consider how tight he is with spending.
20/11/2019, 08:03 - Paul;: Why would it kill spurs? Too frail and weak for it? Likely to make son cry?
20/11/2019, 08:06 - Jack G;: Just seen their next game is at our place, spicey
20/11/2019, 08:07 - Damian Rumble: But I thought that everyone knew mourinho was shit now ..
20/11/2019, 08:09 - Rob;: I am guessing she means he will kill the ideals she sees Spurs as having - playing nice football and not being managed by a human shaped cunt
20/11/2019, 08:09 - Rob;: Basically the same problem every club except Chelsea has had with Mourinho
20/11/2019, 08:09 - Paul;: He got Man U to 2nd. His greatest achievement. He’s excellent but people are too afraid of him
20/11/2019, 08:10 - Rob;: Mourinho would try to take the ring
20/11/2019, 08:10 - Rob;: Not someone you want in the fellowship
20/11/2019, 08:12 - Jack G;: His underdog seige mentality style suits spurs well though
20/11/2019, 08:12 - David;: Ah this is great
20/11/2019, 08:12 - David;: Can't wait to watch it all unravel
20/11/2019, 08:13 - Jack G;: Would love it if we can beat them on Saturday, not confident though
20/11/2019, 08:13 - Jack G;: Mourinho instantly on the back foot
20/11/2019, 08:15 - Rob;: The bounce though Jack
20/11/2019, 08:17 - Jack G;: Yeah that’s a concern. If there’s ever a game for us to turn our form around though it’s this
20/11/2019, 08:17 - Rob;: Bounce higher
20/11/2019, 08:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Reckon he will sort them out for this season

20/11/2019, 08:51 - Jack G;: He’s a massive cunt
20/11/2019, 08:53 - Paul;: Pot to Arsenal. What then
20/11/2019, 08:57 - Paul;: Mourinho’s reputation definitely declined while at Man Utd. However, Utd’s plight since he left has shown how good a job he really did there. Genuinely still believe he‘s one of the best managers in the world and this could be an great bit of business by Spurs.
20/11/2019, 09:04 - Sam;: clearly your opinion there lol..
20/11/2019, 09:08 - Paul;: Lol yeah yeah

20/11/2019, 09:50 - Paul;: Last season, Spurs didn't spend and Poch got them a Top 4 in the PL and the CL Final. He's had a rough start to the season, but on what planet do you bin a boss who can do that?! Mourinho is yesterday's man in football who only wins if he spends money. Spurs don't.
20/11/2019, 09:51 - Jack G;: Spot on. Poch has done miracles at spurs, had turn overachieving for 4 seasons straight and got them to a bloody champions league final

21/11/2019, 13:56 - Rob;: At least I hope so

23/11/2019, 16:49 - Rob;: Who knows. He might not want the job, and I'm sure somehow Emery will remain for months and months
23/11/2019, 16:49 - Paul;: Are you a fan of the gunnersaurus?
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Oh huge
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Paul;: Would you take wenger back now?
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Excellent naff cultural icon
23/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: No
23/11/2019, 16:51 - Paul;: If it was either he came back or went to Tottenham?
23/11/2019, 16:51 - Paul;: And Henry joins him as the kit man
23/11/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Only as kit man?
23/11/2019, 16:52 - Paul;: He’d do other talisman functions
23/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: You couldn't let Henry just be a kit man, he's got a daughter to put through ancient history lessons at Highgate school
23/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: (my mate teaches her)
23/11/2019, 16:54 - Paul;: Well I’m afraid this is the scenario
23/11/2019, 16:55 - Paul;: Primarily kit man but available for talisman things but he has to be with wenger
23/11/2019, 16:55 - Rob;: Well yeah, in your unlikely scenario I'd rather have them both back than both at Spurs
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: But you have him for 10 years
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: That’s another thing I forgot to mention
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: So he's 80 before he finally retires? Christ
23/11/2019, 16:56 - David;: Emery in
23/11/2019, 16:56 - Paul;: Little goal then
23/11/2019, 16:57 - Jack G;: Still should go
23/11/2019, 16:57 - Jack G;: Southampton should have been 3 or 4 up

24/11/2019, 15:17 - Paul;: Did people find out who that guy was who didn’t believe he was in the top 50% of earners despite earning 80k?
24/11/2019, 15:31 - Rob;: Someone did find his name I think, yeah
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Rob;: Not sure he needs to be personally embarrassed any more than he's already done himself
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Paul;: He was so angry earning 80k
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Rob;: Yeah
24/11/2019, 15:32 - Paul;: Couldn’t believe his misfortune
24/11/2019, 15:33 - Rob;: I think basically mixing up income with wealth
24/11/2019, 15:33 - Paul;: Was his point he tried to make that the richest people have no income so won’t be effected by it and need a different way to tax the super rich  or something
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: Just managed to confuse it all
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Rob;: No, not at all
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: I’m sure he said something to that effect
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Rob;: He thought a lot of people, doctors and solicitors namely, earned more than him
24/11/2019, 15:34 - Paul;: Or was about to
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Paul;: So is he not surprised by what he can afford?
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: He felt half of people earned more than him
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Rob;: It never got into that
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Paul;: Thinks of himself as poor. Classic northern mentality
24/11/2019, 15:35 - Stefan;: He just had a completely warped and self-pitying view of what others earn
24/11/2019, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: This would ha e actually been a good point
24/11/2019, 15:36 - Hamish Sinclair: But no I think he just thought 80k wasnt a lot and that all lawyers and doctors earn shit loads
24/11/2019, 15:36 - Rob;: He basically seemed to identify as low-income and not one of the fortunate, despite earning enough to be in the top 5%
24/11/2019, 15:38 - Paul;: So assumed lawyers are on at least 160k?
24/11/2019, 15:38 - Stefan;: Yeah, which is why income from wealth needs to be taxed the same as earned income
24/11/2019, 15:38 - Rob;: I think he probably hadn't thought of it in terms of percentiles, and couldn't deal with the idea that 80k+ is top 5% because it's nowhere near £1 million
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Paul;: I wonder who’s paying him 80k. He seems quite clueless
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Hamish Sinclair: I had this thought aswell
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Think he works in IT
24/11/2019, 15:39 - Stefan;: This is it - the top 5% contains a huge range of incomes - top 1% and 0.1% are each massively different

24/11/2019, 16:13 - David;: 👍
24/11/2019, 16:13 - Rob;: Lol, Bullet
24/11/2019, 16:16 - David;: Also don't even think he is one of the people labour will tax more? Thought they wanted a 50% rate above 100k
24/11/2019, 16:16 - David;: Plus changes to capital gains and corporation tax
24/11/2019, 16:17 - David;: Don't think he would pay any more income tax
24/11/2019, 16:25 - Sam;: On the labour calculator it’s about 80k at which you’d pay more under Corbin than the current, but it’s like a £100 more. Irrelevant
24/11/2019, 16:26 - Sam;: https://calculate.forlabour.com
24/11/2019, 16:29 - Rob;: He's probably one of those people that thinks higher tax bands apply to your whole salary. The amount of people you meet who think that
24/11/2019, 16:30 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah, classic misconception
24/11/2019, 16:30 - David;: Ah yeah it will be this idiocy
24/11/2019, 16:33 - Rob;: They often then say something like 'I'd ask to earn £1 under the threshold, then I'd earn 20% more'
24/11/2019, 16:34 - Paul;: Like arshavin
24/11/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: A conservative party worker actually wrote something to this affect on twitter, then had to delete her account in shame
24/11/2019, 16:34 - Rob;: Effect*
24/11/2019, 16:34 - David;: Another thing people famously misunderstand is that if you get something funded through taxation you have less of a drain on the income. E.g. he would have free  broadband so £30 less every month he is not finding from disposable income. Just shifts how it is paid for.
24/11/2019, 16:34 - David;: *funding
24/11/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: Yeah. Poor little meerkat. Hadn't factored in the difference in corruption here
24/11/2019, 16:35 - David;: If we had no NHS you would need health insurance so would have a bit more income but would just spend it on thay. People seem to have real trouble grasping this
24/11/2019, 16:39 - Paul;: There was a guy on the train who was speaking very loudly (assume on purpose) about how he was on Corbyns ‘list’ and he was ready to move to Portugal to live tax free for 10 years. Buy to let person. Always full of shit usually anyway
24/11/2019, 16:40 - Paul;: Came across a complete cunt
24/11/2019, 16:41 - David;: There's a lot about
24/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Hate the buy to let people
24/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Your Jessica chai’s
24/11/2019, 16:42 - Paul;: Always self promoting
24/11/2019, 16:43 - David;: Think Portugal charges tax last time I checked
24/11/2019, 16:44 - Paul;: Lol
24/11/2019, 16:44 - Paul;: 10 years free mate
24/11/2019, 16:44 - Paul;: Just go live there
24/11/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: That great show I found where the woman actually spent all her money going to financial freedom / get rich conferences and went bankrupt
24/11/2019, 16:47 - Paul;: From the expense of it
24/11/2019, 16:49 - Hamish Sinclair: This sounds great what was it called?
24/11/2019, 16:49 - David;: Nice irony there
24/11/2019, 16:49 - Hamish Sinclair: My favourite type of person is the one who owns multiple buy to let properties yet still cant understand how it's so dificult for their own kids to get on the property ladder
24/11/2019, 16:51 - Paul;: Trying to find the episode
24/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: I like all those painful 'We're 27 and we've managed to buy a house' articles, where they say they always buy the cheaper brand of biscuits etc for most of it, then casually slip in that they've been living with parents for five years, or received a large gift towards a deposit, without twigging that that is how, essentially that alone.
24/11/2019, 16:54 - Rob;: Rosie Newman was in one

24/11/2019, 16:56 - Rob;: Ah yeah the fucking avocado. £1 for two servings.
24/11/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Meals not being an avoidable expensive
24/11/2019, 16:57 - Rob;: Rent: probably worthy 300-700 avocados a month
24/11/2019, 16:58 - David;: Lol
24/11/2019, 17:00 - David;: Housing affordability mainly an issue of indulgent biscuit selection
24/11/2019, 17:01 - Paul;: What was she saying
24/11/2019, 17:01 - David;: Nothing to do with 30 years of financialisation
24/11/2019, 17:03 - Stefan;: Fiat 500 is the defining symbol of people like Rosie Newman
24/11/2019, 17:03 - Stefan;: Morons who think the economy is purely about individual effort and who don't understand marginal tax rates
24/11/2019, 17:03 - Rob;: I've been trying to find it but can't. We definitely shared it on the thread. I think basically the usual guff: we're careful, but also I lived rent free with parents for ages
24/11/2019, 17:05 - Paul;: So Midlands
24/11/2019, 17:05 - Paul;: Very super dry wearing

24/11/2019, 17:07 - Hamish Sinclair: I didnt know either and came up with this
24/11/2019, 17:08 - Stefan;: It's become shorthand for  un-self-aware young people who are outraged by higher taxes on over £80K
24/11/2019, 17:08 - Paul;: >using Twitter

24/11/2019, 17:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Stefan we need your guidance on this one
24/11/2019, 17:16 - David;: Lol 'cant wait for Ibiza with my girls xx'
24/11/2019, 17:16 - Stefan;: Definitely Rosie Newman
24/11/2019, 17:16 - Rob;: I like how the love of Tango Ice Blast  that article talks about seemed like a randomly plucked specific to illustrate something general, but then crops up again and again in genuine tweets
24/11/2019, 17:16 - Rob;: I'd never even heard of Tango Ice Blast
24/11/2019, 17:17 - Rob;: Would Jodie Marie Brain be too stupid, rural and unfashionable to really be Fiat 500?
24/11/2019, 17:17 - David;: Is it just people who whole existence is geared towards the purchase of cheap tat essentially?
24/11/2019, 17:18 - David;: Bott wouldn't have the purchasing power to be fiat500
24/11/2019, 17:18 - Paul;: I think it’s a middle manager , super dry , midlands mentality
24/11/2019, 17:19 - Paul;: Likes F1
24/11/2019, 17:19 - Paul;: And lads holidays
24/11/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: And big Chineses, apparently
24/11/2019, 17:20 - Hamish Sinclair: What is Midlands mentality?

24/11/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: Yeah, she's like Fiat500 grown up
24/11/2019, 17:20 - Paul;: People who wear super dry is your best example. People who like to think they’re salt of the earth or righteous but just aren’t quite
24/11/2019, 17:21 - Paul;: Will holiday in Dubai or go to Essex for a night out
24/11/2019, 17:21 - David;: Lol yeah yeah
24/11/2019, 17:21 - David;: Huge demographic. More of those than actual working class
24/11/2019, 17:22 - Phill: >holidaying in Dubai
24/11/2019, 17:22 - Rob;: Basically huge life focus on materialistic things. Really into affordable luxury. Not into anything mentally taxing, provocative, or odd. Happy to be in the mainstream and sees things outside that as weird, which is bad.
24/11/2019, 17:23 - David;: Schedule their lives around TV series - love island, I'm a celebrity etc.
24/11/2019, 17:23 - Paul;: Yeah yeah. Will often go to the cinema as a big weekend activity. Likely to have a membership to cineworld
24/11/2019, 17:23 - Hamish Sinclair: 👍
24/11/2019, 17:23 - Rob;: Going on holiday in order to have pictures of being on holiday

24/11/2019, 17:29 - Paul;: The inbetweeners are a classic example. Those types of people
24/11/2019, 17:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah yeah. Probably still buys DVD and blurays
24/11/2019, 17:30 - David;: Will always be ordering whatever on the menu symbolises expense over what they actually want to eat. Oysters whenever offered

24/11/2019, 17:53 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/11/2019, 18:02 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/11/2019, 18:02 - David;: Lol
24/11/2019, 18:05 - David;: The boy greenwood
24/11/2019, 18:05 - Sam;: Hiiiiiib
24/11/2019, 18:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Wow
24/11/2019, 18:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Soljkaer in
24/11/2019, 18:07 - Sam;: It’ll end 3-3 of course but it’s a nice 10 minutes
24/11/2019, 18:07 - Phill: Lol united
24/11/2019, 18:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Results like this and arsenals draw yesterday just papering over cracks surely
24/11/2019, 18:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Would be better to just lose and get poch in
24/11/2019, 18:08 - Sam;: Nah
24/11/2019, 18:09 - Sam;: She’d United have been good this season
24/11/2019, 18:24 - David;: Hell of a 10 minutes though
24/11/2019, 18:24 - David;: At least the emergence of Williams. You can take that
24/11/2019, 18:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah you called it
24/11/2019, 18:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Who is William's?
24/11/2019, 18:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Not even on fantasy football
24/11/2019, 18:28 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/11/2019, 18:33 - Rob;: Very nice
24/11/2019, 18:33 - Rob;: Too much cold weather shit in Seven worlds, one planet
24/11/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: 'We're in Asia, where it's cold'
24/11/2019, 18:34 - Rob;: 'Welcome to freezing South America'
24/11/2019, 18:35 - David;: One of the best live sets ive ever seen. See them if you get the chance
24/11/2019, 18:35 - David;: Buy Blanco bonds
24/11/2019, 18:35 - Rob;: 'deep in the freezing oceans of... southern Australia'
24/11/2019, 18:36 - David;: 'one planet, all of it fucking freezing'
24/11/2019, 18:37 - David;: 'seven world all with a distinctive nip in the air'
24/11/2019, 18:37 - David;: *worlds
24/11/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Nothing but cold, white desert landscapes
24/11/2019, 18:37 - Rob;: Billed as entirely different worlds
24/11/2019, 18:39 - David;: Is this not just the cold episode?
24/11/2019, 18:42 - David;: Seven worlds one nip
24/11/2019, 18:46 - Rob;: Nah every one so far has had a cold bit
24/11/2019, 18:46 - Paul;: Haven’t watched any of them. Any good? As good as planet earth?
24/11/2019, 18:48 - Rob;: No it's a step down from Planet Earth or Blue Planet
24/11/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Bit still good. Just maybe lacking variety, despite suggesting it's full of variety
24/11/2019, 18:49 - Paul;: I won’t be investing
24/11/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Big on seals, walruses, and prey Vs Hunter chases
24/11/2019, 18:50 - David;: Never like any wildlife shows set in urban environments
24/11/2019, 18:50 - David;: Stop trying to ruined my nature/culture distinction
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Yeah they're shit
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Koalas are fucked then
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Paul;: I’ve never watched the human planet urban episode
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Functionally extinct
24/11/2019, 18:51 - Rob;: Can't come back from that
24/11/2019, 18:52 - David;: Ah what?
24/11/2019, 18:52 - Damian Rumble: Nah mate
24/11/2019, 18:53 - David;: How did we drop the ball on the koala so hard?
24/11/2019, 18:53 - Rob;: Yeah, they were fucked already, then this year's huge wildfires have wiped out 80% of their habitat
24/11/2019, 18:53 - Phill: My adrenal gland gets too fatigued watching seven world's 1 cup. Too my peril.
24/11/2019, 18:53 - Phill: Too much peril"
24/11/2019, 18:54 - David;: Nah they'll be fine
24/11/2019, 18:54 - David;: 20% you can make do with that
24/11/2019, 18:54 - Rob;: But the 100% we had before was already shit
24/11/2019, 18:54 - David;: If someone only left me one of the 5 rooms I the flat i would be annoyed but deal with it
24/11/2019, 18:55 - David;: Wouldn't kill me
24/11/2019, 18:55 - Phill: The koala looks like the kind of thing that's due for extinction.
24/11/2019, 18:55 - Rob;: Basically it's the point now where there's not enough genetic diversity left. And the trends that are destroying their habit are intensifying not lessening
24/11/2019, 18:55 - Phill: Your dodos. Your kakapos.
24/11/2019, 18:56 - David;: Expose them to radiation to force mutations and expend the gene pool again?
24/11/2019, 18:57 - Rob;: That wouldn't help you have non-inbred kids, but it would help you get cancer
24/11/2019, 18:58 - Rob;: Hard to make a population more disease resistant by upping their rate of cancer
24/11/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: That said, the Chernobyl exclusion zone has been brilliant for nature.
24/11/2019, 19:03 - Rob;: Humans worse than cancer
24/11/2019, 19:03 - Paul;: I want the koala. Very wizened. Should work on bringing them back
24/11/2019, 19:07 - David;: >the lynx
24/11/2019, 19:07 - David;: Not big enough to be a proper big cat but not small enough to be a house cat
24/11/2019, 19:10 - Rob;: I prefer an ocelot

24/11/2019, 20:23 - David;: In just 20 years' time, the average office worker will have a hunched back, protruding stomach and sore eyes, according to a life-sized doll developed as part of a report into workplace health.
24/11/2019, 20:23 - David;: Makes it seem like the doll was making the prediction
24/11/2019, 20:24 - Paul;: They developed the doll to make the prediction but in turn it predicted itself
24/11/2019, 20:26 - Paul;: Do some people not have daemons? Or does everyone get one?
24/11/2019, 20:34 - Damian Rumble: Everyone
24/11/2019, 20:34 - Damian Rumble: But they seem a bit inconsistent whether they show them or not
24/11/2019, 20:35 - Paul;: Yeah re the bar fight
24/11/2019, 20:35 - Rob;: I think for cost reasons they are just pretending everyone has a mouse in their pocket
24/11/2019, 20:36 - Paul;: Lol
24/11/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: That guy has a little lizard
24/11/2019, 20:37 - Paul;: So shit small animals
24/11/2019, 20:38 - Stefan;: Always good when there's a dramatic shot of  powerful people marching along a corridor, but there's a bird, dog, weasel and butterfly following them
24/11/2019, 20:38 - David;: Naturally he had a vole behind his neck at the time
24/11/2019, 20:38 - Rob;: Yeah, I think using them sparingly
24/11/2019, 20:38 - Rob;: ...is best
24/11/2019, 20:39 - Paul;: You’re daemon is actually the parasitic fish that lives in the urethra
24/11/2019, 20:39 - Rob;: Welcome to the boardroom everyone, please is more this rhino
24/11/2019, 20:39 - Rob;: *excuse this
24/11/2019, 20:41 - Paul;: What’s the max size on a daemon ?
24/11/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: There's no rule in the book against having a blue whale
24/11/2019, 20:42 - Stefan;: Depends what the latest Daemon Regulations say
24/11/2019, 20:42 - Stefan;: Must be a lot of micro-regulation by the Magisterium
24/11/2019, 20:42 - Damian Rumble: I've got no idea who this guy who occasionally travels to our universe is. He wasn't in the books right?
24/11/2019, 20:44 - Rob;: Lord Boreal, he is
24/11/2019, 20:44 - Rob;: I think he's the man stalking them in the mufela world in Amber Spyglass
24/11/2019, 20:44 - Stefan;: Yeah he's mainly in the second book but they've brought a lot of that forward in the series
24/11/2019, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Ah... Useful info
24/11/2019, 20:46 - Paul;: I don’t like this link to the real world
24/11/2019, 20:56 - Rob;: Looking him up, he's not. That's another magisterium guy with a snake daemon
24/11/2019, 20:57 - David;: I'm just going to let all the epis come out and then watch them back to back
24/11/2019, 20:58 - Rob;: Assuming they're splitting into 3 series
24/11/2019, 20:59 - David;: Can't be dealing with it too much to take on
24/11/2019, 20:59 - Rob;: If not it'll go on for ages
24/11/2019, 20:59 - David;: How are Wolves suddenly 5th - has anyone audited this? They were ded
24/11/2019, 21:03 - Damian Rumble: I can't really remember too much about that last two couple of books but there's alot of content there. Three hopefully they don't cancel after the first part like they did with the movie version
24/11/2019, 21:03 - Paul;: The movie was shit though
24/11/2019, 21:04 - Paul;: They johnned it
24/11/2019, 21:05 - Damian Rumble: Straight into war of the worlds now ... Yaaas
24/11/2019, 21:06 - Damian Rumble: It's just the way it was too long so they opted not to bother finish the first book. Ending right before the climax
24/11/2019, 21:28 - David;: And it was raw shit
24/11/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Yeah it was dump
24/11/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: They removed all the religious elements
24/11/2019, 21:47 - Rob;: Just don't let Americans near our books

25/11/2019, 08:08 - Rob;: There are billions of rocks on Mars. One to look like almost anything
25/11/2019, 08:10 - Paul;: This one is definitely an insect

Some LibDem drama from my neighbourhood
25/11/2019, 18:38 - Stefan;: He made references to “hot young boys” and “whiny bitches”
25/11/2019, 18:39 - Stefan;: His choice PR response when this all came to light: “I’m on Grindr too, you know. I bet if you find something good on there you’ll make the nationals"
25/11/2019, 18:40 - Damian Rumble: I've meet that guy. He was the hackney campaign coordinator for us for quite a few years
25/11/2019, 18:43 - Damian Rumble: Really stupid thing to tweet
25/11/2019, 19:22 - Phill: Lol just catching up on QT
25/11/2019, 19:23 - Paul;: People seem to be incredibly retarded when using social media
25/11/2019, 19:23 - Phill: Swinson getting banged

25/11/2019, 19:36 - Phill: That's where she stores her hypocrisy.
25/11/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: According to Damian everything is going perfectly because people are criticising the past which means their current strategy couldn’t be better
25/11/2019, 19:40 - Paul;: Otherwise people would be attacking that

25/11/2019, 20:04 - Paul;: Both but more so Michael mccintyre
25/11/2019, 20:04 - Paul;: Peter Kay as well back in the day
25/11/2019, 21:14 - David;: Yeah Mccintye

25/11/2019, 21:17 - David;: Russell Howard
25/11/2019, 21:18 - David;: He was very shit
25/11/2019, 21:23 - Paul;: Who was that little gnome like guy from mock the week who is completely shit
25/11/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: Never said anything funny
25/11/2019, 21:26 - David;: andy parsons?
25/11/2019, 21:26 - Paul;: Yeah
25/11/2019, 21:27 - David;: Russell Howard annoyed me more
25/11/2019, 21:27 - David;: The relentless blandness and inanity
25/11/2019, 22:50 - David;: Ah, the newsnight thing on trans. Knob cut out of your arm and grafted on. Then wants to go back to female
25/11/2019, 23:05 - Stefan;: Are they reporting on people who detransition? It's a miniscule proportion. And used by some to make transition look like some kind of superficial fad
25/11/2019, 23:27 - David;: Yes although they pointed that out
25/11/2019, 23:28 - David;: They were going into the ethics of transitioning before puberty, adolescence etc.
25/11/2019, 23:30 - David;: Saying should you give people talking therapy first before they can access hormone therapy, as it can be entangled with other mental health issues, or is that stigmatising it
25/11/2019, 23:33 - David;: But the main thing I took away was the knob cut from the arm
25/11/2019, 23:36 - Stefan;: Yeah that's an area of legit debate. Problem is all the anti-trans bullshit in the media that politicises what's essentially a healthcare issue. Might watch to see how the bbc deal with it
25/11/2019, 23:37 - Stefan;: Didn't know they could make one from an arm - genius. thought it had to be the belly fat
26/11/2019, 00:18 - Damian Rumble: Pelicans. What a load of pricks. (Ref. Seven worlds)

26/11/2019, 07:30 - Rob;: Yeah I thought that. Like having a feeding strategy that involved waiting for someone to buy crisps, then pinching each individual crisp from their hand
26/11/2019, 07:30 - Rob;: Just get your own crisps you big beaked cunts
26/11/2019, 07:31 - Rob;: Do they hook it up with appropriate blood flow so you get an erection?
26/11/2019, 07:41 - Paul;: Can you opt for using your entire arm as the transplant?

26/11/2019, 14:53 - / James Ball: I was at London zoo once, looking at the pelicans. There happened to be a heron that had also flown into the enclosure. The very Essex mum talking to her young daughter next to me: "awww look at them pelicans, they's nice burds ain't they? Aww an look at the baby one there"

 herons are now forever baby pelicans in my head...
26/11/2019, 14:54 - Paul;: Ball ball
26/11/2019, 14:55 - / James Ball: And on that note, I was working in shoreditch this past weekend and went past a bar called ballie ballerson. It's a very hipster bar full of ball pits. I felt like going in and claiming I was the owner
26/11/2019, 14:56 - Paul;: Hi, Ball Ball of Ballie Ballerson
26/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: A mate had their birthday there
26/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: The novelty wears off extremely quickly and you realise it's just very inconvenient
26/11/2019, 14:58 - Rob;: Balls everywhere
26/11/2019, 14:58 - / James Ball: And presumably very grotty. I can't believe they clean the balls very often

26/11/2019, 15:00 - Damian Rumble: Too hipster
26/11/2019, 15:15 - David;: Lol Everton might get Moyes back again
26/11/2019, 15:16 - David;: Can't wean themselves off the Moyes teat
26/11/2019, 15:25 - Jack G;: Surprised he still has football manager career prospects

27/11/2019, 14:49 - David;: Why does Emery never unclench his teeth?
27/11/2019, 14:53 - Rob;: Why does he play such terrible football?
27/11/2019, 14:54 - David;: He opens his mouth without opening his teeth
27/11/2019, 14:54 - David;: Just worked out that's why he looks so odd
27/11/2019, 14:55 - Rob;: Good ebening
27/11/2019, 14:56 - David;: Arsenal could really do with Poch - but that will never happen?
27/11/2019, 14:56 - Rob;: It's probably unlikely for the rivalry reason
27/11/2019, 14:57 - David;: Would actually ironically fit the club brilliantly
27/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: But you'd have said that about Sol Campbell
27/11/2019, 14:57 - Rob;: Yeah I think so
27/11/2019, 14:58 - Rob;: He's a good defensive coach and good on a second rate budget
27/11/2019, 14:58 - Jack G;: Doesn’t Poch have a clause where he gets paid off £12 million by Spurs for the sacking, but if he gets another job within 6 months then he has to forfeit it?
27/11/2019, 15:01 - David;: Not sure Poch would go there as a respect to spurs thing
27/11/2019, 15:02 - Rob;: Yeah, to go directly is a bit of a fuck you
27/11/2019, 16:26 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
27/11/2019, 16:26 - Rob;: And we employed him looking to improve
27/11/2019, 16:31 - Jack G;: That’s pretty poor. Not surprising though when he sets up with a back 5 at home against a Southampton side in the relegation zone
27/11/2019, 16:31 - Rob;: Yeah it makes no sense
27/11/2019, 16:31 - Rob;: He invites pressure onto a weak defence
27/11/2019, 16:32 - Rob;: And leaves quality attacking players isolated
27/11/2019, 16:32 - Rob;: Plays completely to his squad's weaknesses
27/11/2019, 16:43 - David;: Although he might say you have a shit defence and good forwards so try to bolster the defence and hope the forwards put away the few chances you do create?
27/11/2019, 16:44 - David;: The shot difference thing could be a result of trying to keep things tighter knowing you have clinical strikers?
27/11/2019, 16:47 - Rob;: Yes, and 5 at the back if the full backs go forward a lot could do that, but it never seems to work on the pitch how you would hope
27/11/2019, 16:48 - Rob;: This is actually our highest ever number of shots given away per game since those stats started being collected, so it's not actually keeping things tight at all
27/11/2019, 16:49 - David;: Yeah, it's obviously not working but could be the squad balance and players as well as tactics
27/11/2019, 16:49 - Jack G;: Emery’s tactics seem to want to play everything from wide though, nothing through the middle. Very easy to defend against
27/11/2019, 16:49 - David;: I don't think David Luiz was the answer to any of your problems
27/11/2019, 16:50 - Rob;: Yeah, so the one difference to the summer I would behave made would have been a better cemtrehalf, but I think that was meant to be Saliba and we have to wait until next season for him
27/11/2019, 16:50 - David;: I think if he's going to play the way he is it's baffling they haven't prioritised full backs/wing backs
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Jack G;: A better manager could get far more from this squad.
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: Bellerin and Tierney are both good, but have been unlikely both have been injured until recently
27/11/2019, 16:51 - Rob;: *unlucky
27/11/2019, 16:52 - David;: Is Tierney that good? Been playing in the SPL, hard to know yet
27/11/2019, 16:52 - David;: Bit yeah true unlucky with bellerin
27/11/2019, 16:53 - Rob;: He's been a long term target for sure. Not a stop gap
27/11/2019, 16:54 - David;: Havent seen enough of him. It's a big step up from spl to prem will probably take him at least a season to adjust
27/11/2019, 16:55 - David;: What's theoretically your best defence - Bellerin, Sokratis, Luiz, Tierney?
27/11/2019, 17:00 - Rob;: I think Rob Holding is better than one of those centre halves, but that would be Emery's choice I think, yeah
27/11/2019, 17:00 - Rob;: Chambers also looks good when he plays
27/11/2019, 17:01 - Rob;: I'd imagine Holding and Saliba are the long-term plan from next season
27/11/2019, 17:09 - Jack G;: You should be in for doucouré, sure he’d fancy moving on from Watford

27/11/2019, 20:18 - David;: People taking up vaping without a prior nicotine addiction. Then find it's potentially more dangerous than smoking.
27/11/2019, 20:18 - / James Ball: That's big tobacco talking
27/11/2019, 20:19 - David;: But weren't big tobacco also selling the vapes?

27/11/2019, 20:20 - Paul;: They also already owned other brands

27/11/2019, 20:29 - David;: But they've created an addiction where none existed. Would be funny if lots of those people now transition to smoking in response to the health scare

27/11/2019, 20:33 - Damian Rumble: I was under the impression that some US manufacturers were exploiting poor regulations to use some shitty oil instead of glycine, and it killed a bunch of people, hence the "vaping is worse than smoking" rumour came about
27/11/2019, 20:33 - Damian Rumble: (note vaping probably still not a good idea)
27/11/2019, 20:35 - Paul;: There’s no regulation around ingredients
27/11/2019, 20:35 - Paul;: And it’s vitamin e or something they used that is binding to the lungs

27/11/2019, 20:47 - Rob;: An everyone loves a war
27/11/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: We can all watch and imagine we're there, which would be better than being in the EU
27/11/2019, 20:48 - David;: Yeah we want to get back to the good old days of trench warfare
27/11/2019, 20:49 - David;: Before all the health and safety regulation kicked in
27/11/2019, 20:50 - Rob;: When I was young I died at the Somme. Better, simpler time.

27/11/2019, 22:01 - David;: How is he famous enough to dominate the BBC headlines for hours
27/11/2019, 22:01 - David;: Born Vivian James in 1939, he moved to England in 1961 and rose to prominence as a literary critic and TV columnist. He went on to deliver wry commentary on international programming in such shows as Clive James On Television.

27/11/2019, 22:19 - Damian Rumble: Nigel Farage.
27/11/2019, 22:20 - Damian Rumble: Personally said he feared the lib dems would take Tory seats so pulled he men out to give conservatives a free run
27/11/2019, 22:21 - Phill: >dodging the fact that they're actually a piece of shit
27/11/2019, 22:22 - Stefan;: This is a "nowcast" rather than a forecast, there's still 2 weeks for the polls to move. But it's not looking great
27/11/2019, 22:26 - Damian Rumble: If the Tories get a majority and drive off a cliff at the end of 2020 then I'm moving to Singapore
27/11/2019, 22:26 - Damian Rumble: *drive us off
27/11/2019, 22:27 - Rob;: Why chose the place they want to turn us into?
27/11/2019, 22:27 - Phill: 😆
27/11/2019, 22:28 - Damian Rumble: I can get a job there easily and spend a couple of years earning a tonne of money and lounge on a beach in Bali to ride out the storm
27/11/2019, 22:28 - Phill: So why not do it anyway?
27/11/2019, 22:31 - Phill: Isn't is a tax haven? Thought you hated the idea of tax havens?
27/11/2019, 22:32 - Rob;: 2500 km between Singapore and bali. That's a bit like saying you love living in London because you can lounge on a beach in Italy
27/11/2019, 22:34 - Damian Rumble: That's what weekends are for
27/11/2019, 22:37 - Rob;: Oh I seeee, you're ok with ruining the environment too
27/11/2019, 22:38 - Phill: Reeks of liberal elite hypocricy in here
27/11/2019, 22:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Dat carbon footprint doh
27/11/2019, 23:13 - David;: This does rather demonstrate the fact the lib Dems = tories
27/11/2019, 23:22 - David;: BBC News - Ketamine may reduce heavy drinkers' craving
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-50548103
27/11/2019, 23:22 - David;: 'When the sedative was used to disrupt people's memories of why they wanted to drink, they drank less'
27/11/2019, 23:23 - David;: Seems medically sound
28/11/2019, 00:06 - Damian Rumble: er how?
28/11/2019, 06:18 - Paul;: Damo just vote Tory and do yourself a favour
28/11/2019, 08:14 - Rob;: Saying at least I'll be ok because I can move to a tax haven and earn lots of money while enjoying polluting the planet at weekend then not seeing how it could sound rather Tory like is definitely the most Tory thing I've heard this election

28/11/2019, 09:17 - Phill: Spot on.
28/11/2019, 09:31 - Damian Rumble: 1) me potentially to Singapore is not lib Dem policy. Those two things are unrelated.
2) I am going out canvasing this evening to win seats off of Tories in areas labour cannot win. What are you doing?
3) if Boris is returned with a massive majority it will be due to Labour collapsing in the north/west midlands, areas the lib Dems have traditionally been weak. 

Rather than berating me for trying to save the country why don't you get out there and do something about it
28/11/2019, 10:04 - / James Ball: I would argue that none of the political parties at the moment are capable of saving the country. All current options are viewed as very bad by large proportions of the country. All the campaigning in the world is not going to get the lib dems near to government this time around. Sadly the vast majority of people vote blindly, short sightedly or are misled. The best hope of dethroning the Tories is to vote labour and not dilute the anti-tory vote any more.
28/11/2019, 10:10 - Hamish Sinclair: We're all fucked
28/11/2019, 10:11 - Hamish Sinclair: I ended up diving into a far right/Britain first twitter hole yesterday and now I'm totally depressed

28/11/2019, 10:18 - David;: Xhaka's back for the Europa league game though Rob - not all bad news.
28/11/2019, 10:18 - Rob;: That'll be an interesting atmosphere for sure. Reduced crowd capacity and no away fans due to Frankfurt being cunts

28/11/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: I'll get taxed a huge 0.5 points to sell
28/11/2019, 11:52 - Paul;: Fuck
28/11/2019, 11:53 - David;: Heard it is more minor than originally thought?
28/11/2019, 11:53 - Rob;: Rated as 50% chance, which might just mean a game or two
28/11/2019, 11:53 - Rob;: Yeah he's playing it down
28/11/2019, 11:54 - David;: Wow, Johnson actually refusing to be interviewed by Andrew Neil, well known Tory journalist. 🐓
28/11/2019, 11:55 - David;: If Corbyn had done that you'd never hear the end of it.
28/11/2019, 12:01 - David;: Lol and this column that has come to light: '[Johnson] suggested it was “feeble” for a man to be unable or unwilling to “take control of his woman”, arguing Britain needed to “restore women’s desire to be married”. BBC obviously not even picking up on that.
28/11/2019, 12:09 - Stefan;: Even worse, they assured Labour that Johnson would do an interview too  - Corbyn wouldn't have agreed to it otherwise
28/11/2019, 12:10 - Stefan;: Doesn't really matter whether it's bias or incompetence, the end result is the same - they're failing to hold the Tories to account
28/11/2019, 12:15 - David;: BBC have been woeful
28/11/2019, 12:15 - David;: Also the prominence given to anti-semitism claims vs barely reporting the Muslim Council statement.
28/11/2019, 12:17 - Rob;: They should just do an amazing empty chair interview and ask incredibly loaded questions of it
28/11/2019, 12:17 - David;: Yeah - 'So you're refusing to apologise?' over and over again at the chair
28/11/2019, 12:18 - Rob;: 'So empty chair, please stay silent if you admit your policies led directly to the Grenfell fire'
28/11/2019, 12:18 - Hamish Sinclair: It baffles me how the tories decision to duck debates on all of the last 3 elections hasn't got them more critiscism
28/11/2019, 12:19 - Jack G;: People don’t care as long as they get brexit
28/11/2019, 12:19 - Rob;: I loved that there was that Sky panel where every party sent a man, then the greens, who have prominent women but also sent a man, boycotted it because bit was all male
28/11/2019, 12:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Hows Manchester voting jack?
28/11/2019, 12:21 - Hamish Sinclair: You're our man in the north
28/11/2019, 12:21 - David;: It also baffles me how the BBC report statements from faith leaders as disinterested. Clearly leading Jewish organisatios are more likely to have sympaties with Israel and so likely to oppose a more pro-palestine foreign policy.
28/11/2019, 12:22 - David;: They therefore have an interest in saying things that make Labour being elected less likely.
28/11/2019, 12:23 - Jack G;: Big on labour up in Manchester, lots of safe labour seats
28/11/2019, 12:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Are brexit party a big thing up there?
28/11/2019, 12:24 - David;: Think that would be more the grotty satellite towns wouldnt it?
28/11/2019, 12:24 - David;: your Bolton's etc.
28/11/2019, 12:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah yeah yeah. Should do an analysis for correlation between  brexit party support and local football club debt

28/11/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: Yeah it always does that
28/11/2019, 12:28 - Rob;: Always gets me
28/11/2019, 12:29 - David;: Must be a lot of grot in Huddersfield

28/11/2019, 12:33 - Rob;: Huge borders everywhere, goods having to travel in and out of the EU 100 times on the way through the country
28/11/2019, 12:35 - Stefan;: Yeah and the chief rabbi speaks only for a certain group of orthodox Jews, and even then only as a figurehead. Nothing like the pope. He's a personal friend of Johnson.
28/11/2019, 12:35 - Stefan;: Ha me and a friend talked about this - you'd have armoured road/rail corridors between the cities, like the one from West Germany to west Berlin
28/11/2019, 12:36 - Rob;: Oxfordshire was in though, we'd have that
28/11/2019, 12:36 - Stefan;: Except Cherwell, my home district
28/11/2019, 12:36 - David;: Yeah exactly.
28/11/2019, 12:38 - David;: How small a level do you take it down to?
28/11/2019, 12:38 - David;: Like does Chippy potentially have a border with over norton?
28/11/2019, 12:39 - Stefan;: Street level
28/11/2019, 12:40 - Stefan;: You have to cross 7 international borders to get milk from the shop

03/12/2019, 20:22 - David;: Prem games on prime
03/12/2019, 20:22 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. Every game this midweek
03/12/2019, 20:23 - Rob;: And boxing day fixtures too
03/12/2019, 20:23 - David;: Very strange package to buy
03/12/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: It's smart in that this is when it makes sense to buy a prime subscription - free delivery over Christmas, plus games to watch while you're back with your family
03/12/2019, 20:24 - Rob;: Attractive when you can get a free trial
03/12/2019, 20:25 - Phill: They got me
03/12/2019, 20:25 - Rob;: I'm using my mum's log in
03/12/2019, 20:25 - Phill: Probably won't even cancel prime will forget lel
03/12/2019, 20:25 - Rob;: Could spy on what the old bird's got me for Christmas
03/12/2019, 20:26 - Phill: That's when you see a long history of sex toy buying
03/12/2019, 20:26 - David;: Yeah I'm using fay's prime
03/12/2019, 20:27 - Rob;: What can I say, she buys me what I ask for
03/12/2019, 20:28 - David;: strong player interface
03/12/2019, 20:29 - David;: Commentary team seems quite own brand
03/12/2019, 20:30 - Paul;: Is it like a mark lacy / joe hill duo?
03/12/2019, 20:30 - David;: I mean I can't see their faces so it could actually be them
03/12/2019, 20:30 - Rob;: Yes I think it is them
03/12/2019, 20:32 - David;: Surprised more eyebrows weren't raised when that was announced
03/12/2019, 20:34 - David;: How much did just these 2 gameweeks set Amazon back?
03/12/2019, 20:41 - David;: Angelino = Shia Labeouf
03/12/2019, 20:41 - Rob;: They'll avoid it back in tax, don't worry
03/12/2019, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Yet we have to pay more to watch the same amount if games
03/12/2019, 20:46 - David;: Competition purely negative for the consumer
03/12/2019, 20:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah. The sky monopoly better value
03/12/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: Yeah, nothing like normal competition where you can get the whole product from the  provider you want
03/12/2019, 20:49 - Rob;: You wouldn't want supermarket competition to mean you couldn't get a full meal at any one shop
03/12/2019, 20:50 - David;: 'fuck sake, waitrose has bought the right to carrots but onions are still with sainsbury's'
03/12/2019, 20:50 - Rob;: 'sorry, Aldi own the rights to potatoes, but we do have cling film and swede'
03/12/2019, 20:51 - Rob;: Sorry mate, we have salt but not pepper
03/12/2019, 20:51 - David;: 'But also we had to bid through the roof to retain the Swede rights and have passed the costs on, so they will now cost you what you used to spend getting both potato and swede'
03/12/2019, 20:52 - Rob;: Your only other option is to go to the pub, where you get a free swede if you buy a pint every 45 minutes
03/12/2019, 20:53 - Rob;: But the pub is likely to out out of business as it can't afford the swede rights that are bringing all the customers in
03/12/2019, 20:54 - David;: Bog roll would be a very strategic product to aquire the rights to. When you need it there's no negotiation.
03/12/2019, 20:55 - Rob;: So Waitrose get it, but they have very few stores in the north
03/12/2019, 20:55 - David;: Yeah lol everyone has to commute miles.
03/12/2019, 20:58 - David;: So the amazon deal is the equivalen to some stationary shop suddenly aquiring the right to one completely vital food ingriedient. 'Fuck sake, Staples is moving into the groceries market and has bought the rights to bread and milk'
03/12/2019, 20:59 - David;: Or a clothes shop - suddenly I have to go to H and M to get butter.
03/12/2019, 21:00 - Rob;: Cucumbers exclusively in Ann Summers
03/12/2019, 21:00 - David;: 'and they're only doing it to drive footfall into their dildo subscription service'

03/12/2019, 21:35 - David;: Because you subsist on a diet of turkey twizlers, cheesy chips and doughnuts?
03/12/2019, 21:37 - Paul;: Damian, when did you last eat a vegetable?
03/12/2019, 21:38 - David;: You must have scurvy by now
03/12/2019, 21:38 - Rob;: Ah Stefan, hard to come back from this
03/12/2019, 22:27 - Rob;: Apparently you can get an 'stadium atmosphere' audio mode on Amazon, where you lose the commentary
03/12/2019, 22:29 - David;: So at the Emirates that's just a mute button?
03/12/2019, 22:29 - David;: Hib
03/12/2019, 22:29 - Rob;: I did almost make that joke myself
03/12/2019, 22:30 - Rob;: But I think you'll find the away fans are very vocal, David
03/12/2019, 22:31 - David;: Do we know anything about ljungberg as a coach?
03/12/2019, 22:32 - David;: I saw Wenger was offering to help. The kiss of death
03/12/2019, 22:32 - Rob;: Not really, this is his first time as a head coach
03/12/2019, 22:33 - Rob;: People seem to like him, and quite a lot was made of his work moving through the ranks at Arsenal
03/12/2019, 22:33 - Rob;: But style wise, I think it might take a while to see
03/12/2019, 22:34 - Rob;: I think it's fairly unlikely he will be made permanent head coach unless he blows everyone's bollocks off
03/12/2019, 22:34 - David;: I've never seen a managerial short list with such disparate styles and directions
03/12/2019, 22:36 - David;: Allegri, Benitez, Poch, Vieira, Howe
03/12/2019, 22:36 - David;: All very different
03/12/2019, 22:36 - Rob;: I would take the lists of candidates with a pinch of salt
03/12/2019, 22:37 - David;: And arteta, don't know much about what he would be like
03/12/2019, 22:41 - David;: I'd just take a Nuno. Strong beard. What's the worst that can happen?

04/12/2019, 19:30 - David;: Games everywhere
04/12/2019, 19:31 - David;: Say what you like about Mourinho he does wear a strong coat
04/12/2019, 19:32 - Paul;: Time to drop salah I think
04/12/2019, 19:57 - Paul;: Fuck off is Abraham back
04/12/2019, 19:59 - David;: Ultimate troll
04/12/2019, 20:20 - Damian Rumble: Lol
04/12/2019, 20:21 - Damian Rumble: How much value did you loose transfering him?
04/12/2019, 20:36 - Rob;: How pink is Michael Keane?
04/12/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: Mild goal from Origi there
04/12/2019, 20:48 - Rob;: A quantum of goal
04/12/2019, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Its filth
04/12/2019, 20:53 - David;: He only does huge goals
04/12/2019, 20:53 - David;: Derby's, champo league finals
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Definitely couldn't do it on  a windy wednesday in stoke
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Unless it was the chamions league final
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Rob;: He's the opposite of the guy who chooses 30 perineum goals a season
04/12/2019, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Always looks suprised to have scored aswell
04/12/2019, 20:55 - Rob;: Haha, the Britannia wins the Champions League but insists it's moved to a Tuesday night in November
04/12/2019, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Its how they would want it
04/12/2019, 20:56 - Rob;: 'The match has been postponed. It's just to balmy out there'
04/12/2019, 20:57 - David;: I do miss the concept of Pulis's Stoke
04/12/2019, 21:05 - Damian Rumble: I don't. I hope they relegated to division 1 this year. I would love that.
04/12/2019, 21:06 - Paul;: Lol the hate of stoke
04/12/2019, 21:13 - David;: The Pukki party is back on
04/12/2019, 21:14 - Rob;: Could you get him now the initial hype has subsided?
04/12/2019, 21:15 - David;: Yeah it's an option now the buzz has subsided
04/12/2019, 21:22 - David;: Is great being able to stream all games like this. The prem should sell a direct package. Cut out all the middle men.
04/12/2019, 21:23 - David;: So £30 a month or whatever to stream all games.
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Rob;: You'd still have the rules about 3pm games being ineligible for broadcast though
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Phill: Such a shit dated rule
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Rob;: Having all the fixtures now unique to midweek rounds like this
04/12/2019, 21:24 - Paul;: Change the rules
04/12/2019, 21:25 - Rob;: It's done to protect attendances
04/12/2019, 21:25 - Paul;: Why can’t they have regional variance
04/12/2019, 21:25 - David;: Yeah fuck that
04/12/2019, 21:26 - David;: Don't need it now
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Rob;: And not just at prem clubs - so people go out to support their local club at 3om
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Paul;: If stoke Everton is on I might want to watch. Would never attend
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Phill: Need evidence to show it actually does
04/12/2019, 21:26 - Phill: If they can throw a VAR in they can test the 3pm rule
04/12/2019, 21:26 - David;: Fair to believe people who go to lower league football would stop because a a streaming service was set up
04/12/2019, 21:27 - David;: *fail to
04/12/2019, 21:27 - Phill: >supporting your local club
04/12/2019, 21:28 - Paul;: How many Oxford United game’s did you all go to
04/12/2019, 21:28 - David;: If you bleed Barnsley you're not going to pie it off because Palace Wolves is now available to stream online
04/12/2019, 21:30 - Rob;: It's the small clubs that don't want it, for whom having 20% of the gate receipt staying at home to watch a televised game every week might send them bankrupt
04/12/2019, 21:30 - Paul;: Just give them 50 quid as part of the deal and be done with it
04/12/2019, 21:30 - Paul;: Next
04/12/2019, 21:30 - David;: Give them a cut of the rights
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Paul;: Do we even need these clubs. Surely time to unplug and let them die
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: Well yeah, they could do that, a football tax system for the many not the few
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Paul;: Keeping all these zombie clubs afloat
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Rob;: Cut off the roots and hope the tree survives
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Jack G;: I bet you love the idea of the European super league
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Paul;: Good to prune the weeds
04/12/2019, 21:31 - Paul;: Which is?
04/12/2019, 21:32 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Sounds shite
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Logistically terrible
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Jack G;: But you don’t want small clubs
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: Champ league is that anyway really
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Jack G;: So just take the richest
04/12/2019, 21:33 - Paul;: No, I’m saying it’s probably time to let the right ones go and we get a streaming service
04/12/2019, 21:34 - David;: It's fair to say well you play a role in developing the players and teams that feed the prem so we'll give you 5% of the revenues to offset any attendence decline
04/12/2019, 21:34 - Paul;: They won’t be missed
04/12/2019, 21:35 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/12/2019, 21:35 - Jack G;: Lord Bob lord
04/12/2019, 21:37 - David;: Successfully convinced
04/12/2019, 21:38 - David;: So we've just been taking it as red all these years because old Bob Lord said it 60 years ago
04/12/2019, 21:39 - Paul;: Do you think it made a huge difference to the 30 die hards turning up at division 6 games in the deep winter
04/12/2019, 21:40 - Paul;: Always were going to be there. Fuck the small clubs
04/12/2019, 21:57 - Rob;: Everton were so heavily tipped to have a good start to the season
04/12/2019, 21:57 - Rob;: Wasted all their easy fixtures
05/12/2019, 09:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Dave is your election poster still in place?

05/12/2019, 21:13 - David;: You've stolen my bounce!
05/12/2019, 21:43 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, someone's got our fucking bounce
05/12/2019, 21:44 - David;: But that's your bounce. By right.
05/12/2019, 21:45 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. It's in the contract. Give us the bounce
05/12/2019, 21:48 - Jack G;: Don’t worry, you’ll beat us easily on Monday. The bounce is coming
05/12/2019, 21:51 - David;: West Ham the one game universal bounce
05/12/2019, 21:51 - David;: Pellegrini must be ded surely
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Jack G;: He got some credit in the bank for beating Chelsea so not quite yet
05/12/2019, 21:52 - Rob;: Brighton shitting on the bounce
05/12/2019, 21:53 - David;: This is the opposite of a bounce
05/12/2019, 21:53 - David;: The sink
05/12/2019, 21:53 - David;: The sag
05/12/2019, 21:54 - Phill: Maupay, Maupay, Maupaycheck for a bounce
05/12/2019, 21:54 - Jack G;: The wilt
05/12/2019, 21:56 - Rob;: Maybe Pardew will get our bounce, wherever he is now
05/12/2019, 21:57 - David;: Unclear what Ljungberg is for
05/12/2019, 21:57 - Phill: He like a merlot
05/12/2019, 22:00 - David;: Yeah, you didn't have the spine to choose a grape with any distinctive characteristics so you ended up with it.
05/12/2019, 22:00 - Jack G;: Which managers are you rumoured to be looking at Rob?
05/12/2019, 22:01 - Rob;: Oh the rumours are everyone
05/12/2019, 22:01 - Jack G;: Big Sam? Always good for a relegation battle
05/12/2019, 22:01 - David;: Nuno have a shortlist yet?
05/12/2019, 22:02 - Rob;: I think truly the club is being run so poorly that they've sacked Emery without having thought about who next, despite there being more than a year of worrying form in during which to think
05/12/2019, 22:02 - Phill: <Media omitted>
05/12/2019, 22:07 - David;: Ljungberg really pisses me off

05/12/2019, 22:12 - Rob;: I have rose tinted specs from his association with the golden age
05/12/2019, 22:13 - Rob;: I am not a fan of him doing a Pardew and losing his free bounce
05/12/2019, 22:14 - Jack G;: I’m fond of him, had a decent spell at West Ham

06/12/2019, 19:12 - Sam;: Lol. Season review DVD, just had to keep it together.
06/12/2019, 19:13 - David;: They'd escaped relegation against the odds as well. Just had to not say weird shit
06/12/2019, 19:14 - Sam;: Such a low bar for success
06/12/2019, 19:14 - Sam;: But they let it through? Or is it leaked?

06/12/2019, 19:16 - David;: Think he's just basically a bit mental and unhinged
06/12/2019, 19:17 - David;: Pinning a player down by the throat
06/12/2019, 19:19 - David;: "There's part of you that suspects Pearson was secretly delighted to be attacked by a pack of wild dogs. There's part of you that suspects he went on holiday with that express intention."
06/12/2019, 19:20 - Sam;: Speaking of fucking up easy situations. The Italian newspaper that went with the headline “Black Friday” to preview the inter vs Roma match tonight
06/12/2019, 19:21 - Sam;: Referencing smalling and lukaku
06/12/2019, 19:21 - David;: Ah.

10/12/2019, 21:50 - David;: Why did he prioritise the fossil set?

10/12/2019, 21:51 - Phill: But he just trolled us by having money so owned us collecting

12/12/2019, 12:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Still pretty depressing though
12/12/2019, 12:06 - Damian Rumble: That's just my personal guess
12/12/2019, 12:06 - Rob;: All we can hope for is some high profile MP casualties
12/12/2019, 12:06 - Damian Rumble: Today's data puts the majority on around +50

12/12/2019, 23:45 - Hamish Sinclair: I actually would like to know the answer to this
12/12/2019, 23:46 - Paul;: Did they not say general polls look at % rather than fptp?
12/12/2019, 23:46 - Paul;: Thought that guy was explaining it earlier
12/12/2019, 23:47 - Paul;: Something like that
12/12/2019, 23:47 - Damian Rumble: BBC News - Exit polls: How accurate are they?
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/election-2019-50716626
12/12/2019, 23:47 - Hamish Sinclair: But they said their exit poll is from 20000 people. Which divided by 600 constuencys is like 30 per constineuncy
12/12/2019, 23:48 - David;: It's a few things. You're asking people right after voting so no undecideds etc. The sample is instantly correct to the turnout without any imputations or assumptions. You don't have to do demographic weighting.
12/12/2019, 23:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Dont understand how they make such an accurate poll per constituency
12/12/2019, 23:49 - David;: And you can do it for individual constituencies so don't have to model average swinga
12/12/2019, 23:49 - Phill: Indicates share of overall vote not seats
12/12/2019, 23:50 - Phill: Seat distribution can vary wildly with the same proportion of votes
12/12/2019, 23:50 - David;: We'll both the MRPs also said comfortable majority
12/12/2019, 23:51 - Phill: No poll indicated this level of butthurt
12/12/2019, 23:51 - Phill: McDonell was nursing visible anal wounds on screen
12/12/2019, 23:51 - David;: Yeah, MRP said 89
12/12/2019, 23:51 - Hamish Sinclair: But a majority has been on the card with a hung parliament just within the margin of error
12/12/2019, 23:52 - Phill: Ni
12/12/2019, 23:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Conservatives have been pumping out briefings about how close it is, but that's just to get the votes out
12/12/2019, 23:52 - Phill: No https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/politics/live/2019/dec/10/general-election-swinson-says-johnsons-rhetoric-puts-eu-citizens-at-risk-of-hate-crimes-live
12/12/2019, 23:53 - David;: Yes, people were clinging on to outer end of margins of error for the few tightest polls
12/12/2019, 23:53 - David;: Very much predicted
12/12/2019, 23:53 - Rob;: I miss Theresa May. I liked that she was relatively ineffective at being a cunt
12/12/2019, 23:56 - Phill: Tory majy predicted. Nothing this large.
12/12/2019, 23:56 - David;: *68. But this was well within margin of error
12/12/2019, 23:57 - David;: And average poll lead was 10 points which translates to a big majority.
12/12/2019, 23:58 - Phill: Not necessarily in FPTP
12/12/2019, 23:58 - Phill: Either way I'm butthurt but going to revel in the trolling
12/12/2019, 23:58 - David;: Yes even in FPTP. When you get to around 5-7 then it depends on local spreads etc. But no one has ever failed to win a large majority with a +10% vote share
13/12/2019, 00:00 - Phill: Agree it points to a majority but the size of it is still on a largely unknown scale due to said local factors.
13/12/2019, 00:01 - Phill: There's no arguing that this is an significantly above average majority based on the pre election poll predictions
13/12/2019, 00:03 - David;: Only vs optimistic readings of the tightest polls. But whatever.
13/12/2019, 00:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, basically a hung parliament was as likely as this majority
13/12/2019, 00:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Opposite end of of the error margin
13/12/2019, 00:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Neither suprising
13/12/2019, 00:05 - Phill: But a hungy would have been surprising
13/12/2019, 00:06 - Hamish Sinclair: In hindsight yes.
13/12/2019, 00:06 - Phill: Are people honestly trying to tell me they weren't even a bit shocked at the scale of the majority on the exit poll.
13/12/2019, 00:06 - Phill: ?
13/12/2019, 00:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Disagree it would have been suprising. Anything within the error margins by definition not a suprise
13/12/2019, 00:23 - David;: 4-1
13/12/2019, 00:23 - David;: A hammering not sure what the fuss is about
13/12/2019, 00:24 - David;: Will be good to get some remain seats in
13/12/2019, 00:25 - Rob;: I'd 368-191 be a Labour fan right now

13/12/2019, 07:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Chuka umunna also failed to take his seat
13/12/2019, 07:11 - Rob;: So many moderate Tories ded
13/12/2019, 07:11 - Hamish Sinclair: And the lib dems kindly split the vote in kensington
13/12/2019, 07:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Good to have them around
13/12/2019, 07:43 - Damian Rumble: Labour split the vote on the two seats I was campaigning in and let the Tories in ffs
13/12/2019, 07:44 - Damian Rumble: Love fptp. Improve your share of the vote by 50% Nationwide and get one less seat
13/12/2019, 08:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, would be interested to see how the results of elections would have changed if AV voting went through

13/12/2019, 09:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, impossible for SNP to now get 50 seats, we dont even get to see ruth Davidson swim naked. Shame

13/12/2019, 09:49 - Rob;: You have to hand it to the Tories, taking an issue like Brexit that everyone though would destroy them, then using it to destroy 100-year labour strongholds
13/12/2019, 09:51 - Jack G;: Cameron has played a couple of blinders. IndyRef to take labour votes out of Scotland, now Brexit to take the northern strongholds off them too
13/12/2019, 10:11 - Paul;: Colleague brought them back from Finland
13/12/2019, 12:05 - Stefan;: And then to dismantle what's left of the NHS in a nice little US trade deal
13/12/2019, 12:06 - Stefan;: Can't wait to pay a few grand any time I need an ambulance
13/12/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Will they destroy the nhs?
13/12/2019, 12:07 - Paul;: Is that a given?

14/12/2019, 11:46 - Rob;: Momentum are mental
14/12/2019, 11:47 - Paul;: What is momentum exactly? Like a steering group within the party
14/12/2019, 11:47 - Paul;: But they’ve taken over
14/12/2019, 11:48 - Rob;: Yeah, a grassroots movement that's there to promote the leftwing of the labour party. Only been around since 2015
14/12/2019, 11:48 - Paul;: Ah so really they should just splinter off and become the momentum party then labour can finally get back to centre
14/12/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: It was so far left people found it easier to go right
14/12/2019, 11:49 - Paul;: Which is mad
14/12/2019, 11:49 - Rob;: Well their aim is basically the opposite big that - to stop Labour moving central
14/12/2019, 11:50 - Rob;: Yeah, fun thing about our politics at the moment. Can't quite vote for socialism, get relatively far right populism instead
14/12/2019, 11:51 - Paul;: Bishop Auckland unable to handle the left
14/12/2019, 11:53 - Paul;: What do. They need a northerner leading

14/12/2019, 12:18 - Paul;: Bashing the beast of bolsover
14/12/2019, 12:21 - Hamish Sinclair: They need a working class leader not from a london constituency, ideally a woman
14/12/2019, 12:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Momentum are pretty fucking mental. I went to some meetings during the doctors strike and every single one ended in a vote for a general strike
14/12/2019, 12:22 - Rob;: Jess Phillips fits the bill, but I don't think a lot men aged 40+ would be able to deal with her being funnier than them
14/12/2019, 12:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Angela raynor

14/12/2019, 13:25 - Hamish Sinclair: I think it highlights our ridiculous electoral system
14/12/2019, 13:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Similar to your point about lib dems upping their share of the vote by 50% and losing seats

14/12/2019, 13:27 - Paul;: If you didn’t have fptp do you eliminate constituencies?
14/12/2019, 13:27 - Damian Rumble: None of this would have happened if Labour had backed AV a few years back. Getting that referendum was the main reason to go into coalition with the tories
14/12/2019, 13:27 - Paul;: Doesn’t it work well for particularly local issues?
14/12/2019, 13:28 - Paul;: Ah
14/12/2019, 13:29 - Damian Rumble: The kind of PR they use in europe often has much larger constituencies, or regions, that you elect multiple people from a list of candidates provided by each party. Think of the system used for the EU elections
14/12/2019, 13:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah proportional representation would. But AV wouldn't
14/12/2019, 13:30 - Paul;: That would be fine. Just do that. Done. Next.
14/12/2019, 13:30 - Paul;: Can get a good blend of people in
14/12/2019, 13:31 - Paul;: A pick and mix of politicians
14/12/2019, 13:32 - Damian Rumble: It would be nice if we a system where enough people sign a petition, then it would force the government to hold an advisory referendum on an issue. It would allow people to express an opinion on an issue that the main political parties are never going to champion (like voting reform, legalising cannabis, etc)

18/12/2019, 14:02 - Hamish Sinclair: But now the lib dems are just yellow tories
18/12/2019, 14:05 - Jack G;: True. I still think they take much more potential labour votes than Tory. Difficult to quantify though
18/12/2019, 14:53 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/12/2019, 14:53 - Damian Rumble: How about that...
18/12/2019, 14:54 - Damian Rumble: Lib Dems took only 12% of labour remainers but 22% of Tory remainers
18/12/2019, 14:56 - Stefan;: Yeah but there's a lot more labour remainers than tory remainers, so the actual numbers the lib dems take are probably about equal
18/12/2019, 14:57 - Sam;: have you not fucked off to Singapore yet Damo?
18/12/2019, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: How the fraction is still small. I think this should put to bed the idea that the lib Dems are in anyway responsible for labour's humiliation.
18/12/2019, 15:00 - Jack G;: No. That’s down to momentum’s idiocy and Rupert Murdoch
18/12/2019, 15:01 - Rob;: I think that fact the lib dems did total shit removed that idea
18/12/2019, 15:01 - Stefan;: Agree with that, libdems could have helped labour win some seats but not enough to stop a tory majority, and labour never engaged in talks about a pact. Blair won 3 times with a much bigger libdem vote share
18/12/2019, 15:02 - Damian Rumble: Haha true
18/12/2019, 15:03 - Jack G;: I find it hilarious that Labour think the only way back is to elect a northern leader when they all just voted for Boris. A southern, Eton educated buffoon
18/12/2019, 16:30 - Paul;: Damo are you looking for a new party to support now?
18/12/2019, 21:32 - Paul;: https://youtu.be/rXjp8Eu1bXE
19/12/2019, 07:05 - Rob;: So Trump impeachment but will probably survive. What s cock tease
19/12/2019, 07:12 - Rob;: A real dry hump
19/12/2019, 07:22 - Jack G;: At least all the republican senators will have to go on record condoning his behaviour now
19/12/2019, 07:23 - Rob;: I think it will all just feed into his narrative of 'regular' guy attacked by the political establishment for tellin it like it is
19/12/2019, 08:01 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
19/12/2019, 08:01 - Rob;: Very throaty
19/12/2019, 08:02 - Jack G;: The cash in the jacket pocket
19/12/2019, 08:05 - Rob;: Lol yeah
19/12/2019, 08:05 - Rob;: The reviews of the Cats film are brilliant
19/12/2019, 08:05 - Rob;: Embargoed until release because the studio knew it was shit
19/12/2019, 08:06 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
19/12/2019, 08:06 - Rob;: My mate wasted a year of his life working on set for it
19/12/2019, 08:07 - Rob;: 'a computer-aided hellscape so off-putting you may suspect eye failure.'
19/12/2019, 08:07 - Rob;: 'Meanwhile, the Frankensteinian marriage of live performance, “digital fur technology” and human/cat anatomical splicing – the boobs! they have boobs??!! – has such endlessly sinister impact that the film's U certificate ought to be an 18.'
19/12/2019, 08:09 - Rob;: 'First contender Jennyandots is a lazy house tabby in the desperate, crotch-scratching shape of Rebel Wilson. Her big number has mice in a doll-house with human faces, and cockroaches in march formation, one of which she gobbles down in mad close-up. With its nightmare production design and nauseating lurches in scale and perspective, it might be the ugliest big-screen musical sequence ever mounted.'
19/12/2019, 08:25 - Paul;: It does look very shit
19/12/2019, 08:26 - Paul;: No one was asking for it
19/12/2019, 09:20 - Phill: <Media omitted>
19/12/2019, 17:17 - Rob;: I hadn't realised every single Independent Group MP lost their seat in the election
19/12/2019, 17:18 - Rob;: They had to inform everyone else
19/12/2019, 20:52 - Damian Rumble: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-politics-50858811
19/12/2019, 20:56 - Sam;: Seriously Damian. This is not a politics shitposting sub reddit.
19/12/2019, 20:58 - Damian Rumble: Funny.... the number of times I thought that but replacing politics with football...
19/12/2019, 21:02 - Sam;: This is for football. In fact, if it could be only one thing. It would be  football
20/12/2019, 15:38 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
20/12/2019, 18:12 - Paul;: Rob, how come films can do review embargoes? What’s the punishment ?
20/12/2019, 18:38 - Rob;: Not being invited to an advance screening to another film by that studio again
20/12/2019, 18:39 - Paul;: But surely you wouldn’t want to be
20/12/2019, 18:39 - Rob;: So they're generally not broken, because for every Cats film there's a blockbuster / Oscar contender that publishers want to review
20/12/2019, 18:40 - Rob;: Cats is by Working Title
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Rob;: Who are owned by Universal
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Rob;: So that's like half the films you could get banned from
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Paul;: Is there big returns from publishing a review?
20/12/2019, 18:42 - Paul;: Kermode instantly out of work
20/12/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: Well not huge no, but generally embargoes at observed across every topic
20/12/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: No point needlessly breaking them for small gain
20/12/2019, 18:43 - Rob;: The fact that reviews get embargoed at all is usually a bad sign and tells people everything they need to know already
20/12/2019, 18:44 - Paul;: Has anyone embargoed a huge hit?
20/12/2019, 18:46 - Rob;: Marvel/Disney operate strict embargoes on films regardless of quality, to help generate extra anticipation among the fanbase who crave, above all else, just to know what happens
20/12/2019, 18:47 - Rob;: They are quite intense to deal with, getting images an copy approved to put out about Framestore films was pretty hard
20/12/2019, 18:48 - Rob;: But that's because they know people will see those films regardless of a good review
20/12/2019, 18:48 - Paul;: Cats hovering on 18% approval rating
20/12/2019, 18:49 - Rob;: Non-franchise films that studios think are good get shown at film festivals months in advance of release to generate word of mouth hype
20/12/2019, 23:46 - Damian Rumble: Cats does look like utter tripe though

21/12/2019, 15:45 - Rob;: I seem to have accidentally captained the young Jack Grealish
21/12/2019, 16:37 - Jack G;: Little goal for you then
21/12/2019, 16:38 - Rob;: A Christmas miracle
21/12/2019, 16:40 - Jack G;: A Christmas cracker of a goal
21/12/2019, 16:45 - Jack G;: Annoying that I can’t watch a West Ham game this weekend. Liverpool should have just put out their under 19s again like in the carabou cup (no bias)

22/12/2019, 20:17 - / James Ball: Sounds like it won't just be me and Damian this year!
22/12/2019, 20:18 - Rob;: I was there last year, ball ball
22/12/2019, 20:20 - / James Ball: Ah yeah. I just remember the long Damian sesh
23/12/2019, 08:23 - Rob;: This is one my favourite bit of Trump nonsense babbles https://twitter.com/thehill/status/1208881147867877377?s=19
23/12/2019, 08:25 - Rob;: "I never understood wind. I know windmills very much, I have studied it better than anybody. I know it is very expensive. They are made in China and Germany mostly, very few made here, almost none, but they are manufactured, tremendous - if you are into this - tremendous fumes and gases are spewing into the atmosphere. You know we have a world, right?"

"So the world is tiny compared to the universe. So tremendous, tremendous amount of fumes and everything. You talk about the carbon footprint, fumes are spewing into the air, right spewing, whether it is China or Germany, is going into the air."
23/12/2019, 08:25 - Rob;: "A windmill will kill many bald eagles. After a certain number, they make you turn the windmill off, that is true. By the way, they make you turn it off. And yet, if you killed one, they put you in jail. That is OK. But why is it OK for windmills to destroy the bird population?"
23/12/2019, 09:17 - Damian Rumble: Lol. Realising that he is actually making the argument for climate change to a load of patriotic red necks, before Segwaying into a piece about killing bald eagles to win them back
23/12/2019, 09:19 - Rob;: Yeah, and that shit argument against wind turbines - that their creation creates co2 emmisions - as if power plants aren't built of concrete and metal too
23/12/2019, 09:21 - Rob;: Funny to hear it garbled up by trump's brain
23/12/2019, 09:30 - Paul;: Lol it says in the comments he got really against windmills due to his Scottish golf course and then building some offshore so it spoilt the view. Got a vendetta against them
23/12/2019, 16:04 - Paul;: Robbbbb they’ve re cut cats already
23/12/2019, 16:06 - Rob;: Apparently they're resupplying it as they put it out without finishing the effects?
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: Forgot to make Judy Dench's hand a cat's
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: Not sure that will make it not terrible
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Paul;: Big move releasing the film before it’s done
23/12/2019, 16:07 - Rob;: I guess Christmas was their one chance to make their money back
23/12/2019, 16:10 - Paul;: They realised it would be complete shit anyway so just get it out there
23/12/2019, 16:10 - Paul;: ?
23/12/2019, 16:15 - Jack G;: Should have just cut it all together
23/12/2019, 16:16 - Jack G;: Altogether*
23/12/2019, 16:20 - Rob;: Well it's a sunk cost, you can't get the production money back, might as well screen it
23/12/2019, 16:21 - Rob;: Quite a lot of shit films end up making money because people are plebs
23/12/2019, 16:21 - Paul;: The chumscrubber
23/12/2019, 16:22 - Paul;: Weren’t a lot of films made as a tax dodge in the past? That’s why there’s so many that are complete shit
23/12/2019, 16:48 - Damian Rumble: Bold move going up against star wars with a piece of shit
24/12/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Damo, Paul, Ball Ball in for Chequers later?
24/12/2019, 12:14 - Rob;: Jack and Stefan too?
24/12/2019, 12:24 - Paul;: Potentially
24/12/2019, 12:28 - Stefan;: Yep, just let me know when
24/12/2019, 12:31 - Rob;: Usually an early-ish kick off. I said 7:30 to Verity
24/12/2019, 12:32 - Rob;: Jaaacccckkkk
24/12/2019, 12:59 - Jack G;: I’m I no in Chippy
24/12/2019, 13:05 - Stefan;: Very Damo-esque

24/12/2019, 14:10 - Damian Rumble: Yeah
24/12/2019, 14:50 - / James Ball: Yeah yeah, I'll be there
24/12/2019, 17:24 - Damian Rumble: The excitement of coming home for Xmas, opening up your annual student loan repayment statement and  finding out how little a dent you've made in it...
24/12/2019, 18:41 - / James Ball: 0 in my case
24/12/2019, 18:42 - / James Ball: I'm probably going to have some food first then come out. Probably a bit after 7:30
24/12/2019, 19:24 - Paul;: I’m here
24/12/2019, 19:25 - Rob;: On my way
24/12/2019, 19:28 - Rob;: Be there now
24/12/2019, 20:13 - / James Ball: En route now
24/12/2019, 21:24 - Sam;: You can whack a mole but you cannot smack a rat. I’ve always said that
25/12/2019, 08:28 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/12/2019, 10:13 - Sam;: Dave, did you loose that toe nail in the end?
25/12/2019, 10:39 - / James Ball: The important Christmas questions being asked
25/12/2019, 10:57 - Rob;: I asked him a while ago. Nail lost

25/12/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
25/12/2019, 10:58 - Rob;: Merry Christmas from Dave's fucking toe
25/12/2019, 11:00 - Paul;: Rob please can you draw the colon thing as a Christmas gift to all
25/12/2019, 11:14 - / James Ball: My brother's colon?
25/12/2019, 11:15 - Paul;: No it’s this new concept I’ve been working on
25/12/2019, 11:24 - Sam;: Good to get a little time lapse on the regrowth
25/12/2019, 12:21 - David;: The toe review
25/12/2019, 12:23 - David;: <Media omitted>
25/12/2019, 12:23 - David;: Was going to make this my card this year
25/12/2019, 12:48 - Paul;: Raaaabbbbbbb
25/12/2019, 12:50 - / James Ball: The snowflake and snowman really make this
25/12/2019, 12:50 - / James Ball: Very Microsoft Word 2003
25/12/2019, 12:50 - Paul;: Microsoft publisher
25/12/2019, 12:51 - / James Ball: Needs more word art
25/12/2019, 13:50 - Damian Rumble: These toes have really made my Xmas....
25/12/2019, 14:02 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
25/12/2019, 14:08 - / James Ball: Ah yes, the long colon
25/12/2019, 14:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Is this just a colon like tail?
25/12/2019, 14:11 - Paul;: Yes but that means you can direct it. It also sucks back up inside when not in use. The blue thing is the colon hook that everyone has so they don’t have to touch bare colon
25/12/2019, 14:12 - Paul;: As it’s a veiny slimy stinking mess
25/12/2019, 14:13 - Hamish Sinclair: What evolutionary advantage are we getting from this?
25/12/2019, 14:13 - Paul;: The colon hook is like one of those snake handling sticks
25/12/2019, 14:14 - Paul;: You can shit on the go. Direct it almost discretely into a plant pot etc
25/12/2019, 14:14 - Paul;: Shit standing up etc. Show me a disadvantage
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Should just have it built into a tail
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: So it has a skin/furry outer layer
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Paul;: Yeah but this colon does retract when no in use
25/12/2019, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Ahh
25/12/2019, 14:16 - / James Ball: Retractable veiny colon
25/12/2019, 14:16 - / James Ball: A whole industry is colon care products springs up
25/12/2019, 14:16 - Paul;: But we need rob to draw it
25/12/2019, 14:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Raaaaab
25/12/2019, 14:17 - Hamish Sinclair: I love the idea of verity meeting you all for "xmas drinks" and she actually gets 4 hours of extendable colon
25/12/2019, 14:18 - Paul;: We kept that very quiet. Can’t unleash the colon talk in public
25/12/2019, 14:18 - Paul;: The masses aren’t ready for it
25/12/2019, 14:24 - Paul;: Raaaabbbbb
25/12/2019, 14:29 - David;: Is it like an elephants trunk but shit comes out rather than water going in
25/12/2019, 14:30 - David;: Has the chequers dealt with the mushroom infestation?
25/12/2019, 14:31 - Paul;: Yeah they did a £1m renovation
25/12/2019, 14:31 - Paul;: Mushrooms vanquished with a milly
25/12/2019, 15:39 - Paul;: Raaaabbbb
25/12/2019, 16:13 - Phill: Where do we store the shitty colon hook? Seems like the convenience of shitting into plant pots is offset by carrying around a rotting, shitty baton
25/12/2019, 16:14 - Paul;: Telescopic isn’t it easy to store
25/12/2019, 16:15 - Phill: Still need somewhere to keep it. Don't want it in my pocket mingling with my wallet or phone. "Can I borrow your phone?" "Sure, excuse the mucus"
25/12/2019, 16:15 - Paul;: Has a carry case
25/12/2019, 16:15 - Phill: Nah.
25/12/2019, 16:19 - Phill: What stops the case getting shitty?
25/12/2019, 16:20 - Paul;: Shitty on the inside so not a problem
25/12/2019, 16:20 - Phill: There are holes on this theory.
25/12/2019, 16:21 - Phill: My grans colostomy bag honks so everyone just be walking round reeking of shit
25/12/2019, 16:34 - Paul;: Yeah there’s a huge market in masking scents and perfumes that’s sprang up
25/12/2019, 16:35 - Rob;: I would have thought it only reeks as much as a normal arse
25/12/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: Just a longer colon you can fondle
25/12/2019, 16:36 - Rob;: I'm not going to be taking time out from family Christmas day to draw it, but I wish it all the best
25/12/2019, 16:37 - Rob;: I'll illustrate sometime in the Christmas break
25/12/2019, 17:10 - Phill: Nah. As soon as shit is outside of the body for an extended period of time it takes on another level of stench.
25/12/2019, 17:13 - / James Ball: It will just see through the sack
25/12/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: But teh trunk is the body
25/12/2019, 17:20 - Rob;: It's like how your cock doesn't feel of piss and cum
25/12/2019, 17:21 - Rob;: *reek
25/12/2019, 17:21 - Paul;: Lol
25/12/2019, 17:23 - Paul;: The trunk
25/12/2019, 17:31 - / James Ball: Colonic trunk socks
25/12/2019, 17:31 - / James Ball: Aerated colon trousers
25/12/2019, 17:48 - David;: 4 types of meat on a plate
25/12/2019, 17:48 - David;: Very gouty
25/12/2019, 17:52 - Phill: I'm not talking about the trunk reeking, just the shitty hook you carry around
25/12/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: Ah yeah. I'm not sure about the hook. Paul you'll need to sell that too me
25/12/2019, 17:54 - Rob;: I would just keep my trunk clean and hold it slightly away from the orifice
25/12/2019, 17:55 - Paul;: I don’t know why the hook has so much opposition. It never touches any shit. The outer skin of the trunk does no have shit on it. That would be found inside the colonic trunk
25/12/2019, 17:56 - Paul;: It’s just unsightly. A tough skin covered in veins and lumps
25/12/2019, 18:03 - / James Ball: Just make it prehensile
25/12/2019, 18:06 - Rob;: Lol, so you can point and shoot hands-free
25/12/2019, 18:17 - David;: Need to know more about the muscle control you have over the shit trunk
25/12/2019, 18:17 - David;: If it's as dextrous as a tail then the hook seems defunct
25/12/2019, 18:21 - Rob;: I'm seeing it as a very thick limp cock
25/12/2019, 18:21 - Paul;: Could be very accurate
25/12/2019, 18:23 - Phill: Don't need a hook for my cock. Don't need one for my shit trunk.
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: Lol
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: What about a sling for the shit trunk
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: Like the ones you carry babies in
25/12/2019, 18:24 - Paul;: But it’s carrying your reeking shit trunk

28/12/2019, 15:03 - Paul;: Or has this been designed
28/12/2019, 15:03 - David;: Also considered having a tail on the other side of the wall so looks as if he's stuck in the fabric of the house
28/12/2019, 15:03 - David;: Nah just been made by an illustrator friend they have
28/12/2019, 15:03 - David;: But I'm imagining it as a proper death mask
28/12/2019, 15:04 - David;: It protrudes a good foot into the room

30/12/2019, 11:57 - Damian Rumble: "WE’RE ALL GOING ON A CLASSY RURAL SESH" [Sounds very familiar]
AirBnBs are fast becoming the new nightclubs. Nobody wants to go out and get fucked any more. They want to book cottages in seaside towns, go on nice long walks, ruin cosy pubs for the locals and then get fucked. So, some of your mates have found some ten person mansion in the Hebrides and they are going to take a bunch of MDMA and laugh at sheep for a couple of days. Probably your well-off media mates, to be honest: nice opportunity for them to lock themselves in a cottage with a bucket of gear and chew each other’s ears off about search-engine optimisation and the state of online content. You’re not invited, no.

31/12/2019, 21:01 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
31/12/2019, 22:17 - David;: Early on New Year's morning, householders drink and then sprinkle 'magic water' from 'a dead and living ford' around the house (a 'dead and living ford' refers to a river ford that is routinely crossed by both the living and the dead). After the sprinkling of the water in every room, on the beds and all the inhabitants, the house is sealed up tight and branches of juniper are set on fire and carried throughout the house and byre. The juniper smoke is allowed to thoroughly fumigate the buildings until it causes sneezing and coughing among the inhabitants. Then all the doors and windows are flung open to let in the cold, fresh air of the new year. The woman of the house then administers 'a restorative' from the whisky bottle, and the household sits down to its New Year breakfast
31/12/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: 20 years on from the millennium bug
31/12/2019, 22:52 - Rob;: Still waiting
31/12/2019, 22:54 - Rob;: It isn't in the mirror, it isn't on the page
It's a red hearted vibration
Pushing through the walls of dark imagination
Finding no equation
There's a red road rage,
But it's not road rage
It's asylum seekers engulfed by a grudge

Scottish friction, Scottish friction
It isn't in the castle, it isn't in the mist
It's a calling of the waters as they break to show
The new black death with reactors aglow
Do you think your security can keep you in purity
You will not shake us off
Above or below

01/01/2020, 02:37 - Rob;: I tried to imply that the deep V belonged to the gays, unwankishly, not that gays in general were a trend of the 2010s. But that's autocorrect for you

03/01/2020, 08:57 - Damian Rumble: G. Super-talented weirdos

People in SW1 talk a lot about ‘diversity’ but they rarely mean ‘true cognitive diversity’. They are usually babbling about ‘gender identity diversity blah blah’. What SW1 needs is not more drivel about ‘identity’ and ‘diversity’ from Oxbridge humanities graduates but more genuine cognitive diversity.

We need some true wild cards, artists, people who never went to university and fought their way out of an appalling hell hole, weirdos from William Gibson novels like that girl hired by Bigend as a brand ‘diviner’ who feels sick at the sight of Tommy Hilfiger or that Chinese-Cuban free runner from a crime family hired by the KGB. If you want to figure out what characters around Putin might do, or how international criminal gangs might exploit holes in our border security, you don’t want more Oxbridge English graduates who chat about Lacan at dinner parties with TV producers and spread fake news about fake news.

03/01/2020, 09:01 - Damian Rumble: "dear Mr Cummings, I'd love to use my skills as a data scientist to push through a digital revolution in Whitehall. Unfortunately you are a massive cunt and I would prefer to punch you in the face. I would love it if you could consider me for interview. Thank you. "

06/01/2020, 22:02 - Phill: High as fuck and been thinking of charities I could start.
06/01/2020, 22:02 - Phill: Best idea is one called "penny on the pound"
06/01/2020, 22:04 - Phill: Where all the people who say "I'd pay a bit more tax for that" donate an extra penny on their pounds of earnings for that year and it goes into one big fund and large sums are donated to things like mental health charities, cancer research, social care initiatives etc etc
06/01/2020, 22:05 - Phill: <Media omitted>

07/01/2020, 15:58 - Rob;: >being so into a burial that you stampede and kill yourself and 49 others

07/01/2020, 17:12 - Rob;: Ending up in a grave at a buriel. V similar
07/01/2020, 17:13 - Rob;: >Live Burial
07/01/2020, 17:13 - David;: As in that's where the real action is?
07/01/2020, 17:14 - Rob;: Yeah, going from spectator to focus
07/01/2020, 17:14 - David;: Lol live burial. It's an actual interment - 'i just came for some low-fi techno!'
07/01/2020, 17:14 - David;: I did think the tickets were cheap
07/01/2020, 17:15 - Rob;: Damo, Did you turn up in Iran for Burial (live)?
07/01/2020, 17:15 - David;: So it's actually burying someone alive
07/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Has to be ticked for crowd control reasons
07/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Too popular
07/01/2020, 17:17 - Rob;: *ticketed
07/01/2020, 17:19 - David;: Metal licker live
07/01/2020, 17:19 - David;: You turn up and it's a guy licking metal
07/01/2020, 17:19 - David;: Cold Play (live) - it's actually a children's winter wonderland installation
07/01/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: Well those were some really excited and deranged street preachers. Not what I expected at all
07/01/2020, 17:22 - David;: Block party - something you might actually get tickets for
07/01/2020, 17:22 - Rob;: Everyone kept going on about this band. Just four insects. Awful.
07/01/2020, 17:28 - David;: I wanted to see four tet but was actually a quartet.
07/01/2020, 17:29 - David;: It did surprise me that the venue was the royal Albert hall
07/01/2020, 18:39 - Damian Rumble: I had seen it on 'bandsintown' but this time thought better of it
08/01/2020, 12:06 - Rob;: Pretty cool property. Part generic modern home. Part LIGHTHOUSE https://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-65896019.html
08/01/2020, 12:23 - Damian Rumble: It's not even on the coast...
08/01/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: Yeah, yeah, just an eccentric vertical extension
08/01/2020, 12:31 - Rob;: 5 miles inland
08/01/2020, 12:32 - Phill: That is grotesque.
08/01/2020, 12:41 - Paul;: What is a windmill
08/01/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: I know the tower came first you nonce
08/01/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: But they've managed to make it look the other way around with the extension
08/01/2020, 12:45 - Phill: Nonce
08/01/2020, 12:45 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/01/2020, 13:18 - Sam;: they've built such an ordinary looking house around it. Just looking like a windmill grew out of a 1930's bungalow.
08/01/2020, 13:18 - Sam;: a horrible growth.
08/01/2020, 13:29 - Rob;: Best to put a conservatory on the back of that

08/01/2020, 20:09 - David;: What's Laura's take on the Harry and Meghan move Sam?
08/01/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Says it’s Megan’s influence. Asked if they’d be ‘stepping back’ from their financial allowance from the privy purse as well..
08/01/2020, 20:59 - Rob;: That is part of the statement - looking to go financially independent
08/01/2020, 21:00 - Sam;: Ah. Well I shall let her know then lol
08/01/2020, 21:02 - David;: But that must all be part of a deeper plan?
08/01/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Still. Their 6 week holiday in Canada was on our dime.
08/01/2020, 21:03 - David;: She is peeling him away from the UK slowly though, does she take issue with that? 'Splitting their time between the united kingdom and north america'
08/01/2020, 21:06 - Sam;: Only a few comments released at this time, full interview to follow tomorrow
09/01/2020, 12:49 - David;: Anyone else seen the grammarly adverts on youtube? The woman in them is the most punchable person that exists.

09/01/2020, 12:59 - David;: <Media omitted>
09/01/2020, 12:59 - David;: Not so much the face though, it's the hateful patronising tone
09/01/2020, 12:59 - David;: Must have been bobarded with this? 'If you write anything on your computer, you need the get grammarly'.
09/01/2020, 13:02 - Jack G;: >need the get
09/01/2020, 13:03 - Rob;: Beach no paid
09/01/2020, 13:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Very Hermione grainger
09/01/2020, 15:02 - David;: Jesus, Hamish you are 6,000 globally in FF at the moment
09/01/2020, 15:03 - David;: On the sly. Pretty competitive league this year.
09/01/2020, 15:06 - Rob;: Hamish is actually closer to being number 1 than Dave, Paul and Jack are to being above Hamish
09/01/2020, 15:07 - Rob;: And it's a fairly tight year
09/01/2020, 15:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, annoyed to have been knocked out the cup in the 2nd round
09/01/2020, 15:20 - Jack G;: I didn’t even qualify for the cup
09/01/2020, 15:21 - Jack G;: Only top 4 million get in apparently, first time that’s ever happened to me
09/01/2020, 15:23 - David;: It's the West Ham way
09/01/2020, 15:26 - David;: I'm still in the top 10% overall but way off Hamish.
09/01/2020, 15:35 - Hamish Sinclair: The shame
09/01/2020, 15:35 - Jack G;: It’s bizarre though because I’m now 2.3 millionth 2 weeks after I was 6 millionth
09/01/2020, 15:36 - David;: Late title challenge?
09/01/2020, 15:37 - Jack G;: Nah, would need a miracle triple captain to even have a chance
09/01/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: At some point the triple captain on a double game week will come off for one of us
09/01/2020, 15:38 - Rob;: Ever since they've introduced it either Kane, Aguero or Salah has either played only one game or done shit in the double game week everyone triple captained them
09/01/2020, 15:39 - David;: You could theoretically get a c.100 point swing from it if your opponent picks a player that does nothing or gets injured on the first game and the player you pick has 4-5 goals and all the bonus points
09/01/2020, 15:39 - David;: just quite unlikely
09/01/2020, 15:40 - David;: Mostly it would ironically work out better to TC them on a single game week where they actually do something
09/01/2020, 15:41 - Jack G;: I got mocked for doing that last season
09/01/2020, 15:41 - Rob;: I think Trent might have the best score across two games so far this season - 32 across GW 19 and 20, could have been worth 98 points if it had fallen as a double game week
09/01/2020, 15:41 - Rob;: Yeah, I think the chance of key player seeing rested in double game weeks makes it horrendously risky
09/01/2020, 15:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Did it come off tho?
09/01/2020, 15:42 - Rob;: Going for defenders who often score/assist who have two good fixtures seems like a less risky bet
09/01/2020, 15:42 - Jack G;: No it was a waste as usual
09/01/2020, 15:43 - David;: I had a troll TC where Aguero scored 2 and then took a penalty for the hat-trick but missed it. That miss was like an 18 point swing in one kick of the ball
09/01/2020, 15:44 - David;: because the points taken off also trebled
09/01/2020, 15:44 - Rob;: I would love to see someone's triple captain sent off in the aftermath of missing a penalty in the first of a double game week before the 60th minute
09/01/2020, 15:44 - Rob;: A yellow and a subsequent straight red
09/01/2020, 15:45 - David;: Having conceded 4 goals as a defender
09/01/2020, 15:46 - Rob;: All of which were own goals they scored
09/01/2020, 15:47 - Rob;: That would be -39 net
09/01/2020, 15:47 - Jack G;: The classic penalty taking defender. Your Leighton Baines
09/01/2020, 15:47 - Rob;: So if that happened to Hamish and Jack had a 100 PT triple captain, Jack would go top
09/01/2020, 15:48 - Rob;: -45 actually
09/01/2020, 15:49 - Rob;: Actually, no it wouldn't, you're 222 behind. Jack, you're fucked
09/01/2020, 15:49 - Jack G;: What about if I get a lucky bench boost as well, and additional 50 or something
09/01/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: Yeah, in another week, if say none of hamish's bench played when he boosted his and yours all scored hattricks
09/01/2020, 15:53 - Jack G;: Don’t forget it’s not just Hamish I’m trying to overhaul. Everyone else has to be shite too
09/01/2020, 15:53 - David;: The classic hat-trick of hatr-tricks from the bench
09/01/2020, 15:55 - David;: You do have more than 16 gameweeks left though. Just need to make 150 up in the TC catastrophe plus 5 every other week
09/01/2020, 15:55 - David;: *16 more
09/01/2020, 15:57 - David;: Haller suddenly coming into form? Bet heavily on the Moyes rennaissance, put everything on that I say
09/01/2020, 15:59 - Jack G;: That is not the way
09/01/2020, 16:00 - David;: The Moyes are back in town

10/01/2020, 17:27 - Damian Rumble: Yeah starmer could be pm material but backing remain so heavily could be a problem up north
10/01/2020, 17:31 - Jack G;: I imagine brexit won’t be a thing by the next election though so shouldn’t be a problem

15/01/2020, 08:03 - Rob;: I swear all the Brexiteer's actually wanted was a bit of pomp and ceremony. We could have just pretended to leave, got the queen to eat a pasty as she stamps on a croissant and cuts an enormous 7 and 3/4 mile Union Jack ribbon that's been draped over the cliffs of Dover with some big UK scissors and shouts BRITAIN IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS, while we all stand watching with our feat in the blessed British sea collectively wanking into  commemorative VHS tape boxes of Carry on Follow that Arab and munching our celebratory bendy British bananas as the British Empire strikes back. Then tomorrow we just quietly keep adhering the latest directive on telecoms and postal services on the sly.

18/01/2020, 22:26 - Hamish Sinclair: How does it work?
18/01/2020, 22:26 - David;: You should at least make the changes to optimised fixtures etc. For that week
18/01/2020, 22:26 - David;: *optimise
18/01/2020, 22:26 - Paul;: Free transfers one week then resets your team back to normal
18/01/2020, 22:27 - Hamish Sinclair: But you cant deactivate it?

18/01/2020, 22:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah
18/01/2020, 22:28 - David;: You can't double up chips that's trolled me before when I tried to use wildcard on a double GW and then bench boost so all players including bench playing 2 teams
18/01/2020, 22:29 - Paul;: Yeah if you used wildcard you wouldn’t be able to use TC
18/01/2020, 22:29 - Paul;: So that could also troll you in a double gw

19/01/2020, 09:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah pretty mental. Would love to see the premier league have that sort of power.
19/01/2020, 09:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Technically it would be like man city being relegated because they are the actual premier league champions and they actually have breached financial fair play

20/01/2020, 07:33 - Rob;: We need to officially include and asterisk in Great* Britain that explains it just means we're larger than Britiany. Would save a lot of delusional bullshita

22/01/2020, 15:50 - David;: They make a good point - the small bags sould be the grab bags, just quickly grabbing them as a light snack
22/01/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: As I said
22/01/2020, 15:51 - Jack G;: Why does it have to have a name at all?
22/01/2020, 15:51 - Jack G;: Just a larger packet of crisps, done
22/01/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: Easy cook rice takes longer to cook than normal rice
22/01/2020, 15:51 - David;: I think the idea is you consider them such good value you have to grab hold of them the instant you see them
22/01/2020, 15:52 - David;: As if grab bags are in permanent danger of selling out
22/01/2020, 15:56 - Rob;: This dress comes in petite, medium and grab bag
22/01/2020, 15:59 - David;: I always read it as an imperative: 'grab bag!'
22/01/2020, 16:00 - David;: grab that bag you filthy crisp hound
22/01/2020, 16:01 - Rob;: Maybe that's why it's become the norm. It's making a lot of people grab a lot of crisps
22/01/2020, 16:02 - Rob;: Maybe 'big' was trialled, but it made people feel bad for eating loads of crisps
22/01/2020, 16:03 - Rob;: Glasses can be half-full or half-empty depending on your outlook, but bags of crisps are ALWAYS half-empty
22/01/2020, 16:05 - David;: I feel worse for grabbing the crisps
22/01/2020, 16:05 - David;: 'Value Bag'? Who doesn't like value
22/01/2020, 16:06 - David;: then you're just being prudent, not a greedy fat fuck.
22/01/2020, 16:52 - Damian Rumble: >NikNaks
22/01/2020, 16:53 - David;: Explain yourself you cretin
22/01/2020, 16:56 - Damian Rumble: Shit in the 90s. Shit now. Don't even count them as crisps. Just fluff packed with e numbers
22/01/2020, 16:58 - Rob;: NikNaks might say the same about you
22/01/2020, 17:02 - David;: Lol yeah that is Damo, fluff packed with e numbers wrapped in the financial times
22/01/2020, 17:02 - David;: I mean clearly the best baked crisp and baked crisps are clearly the superior crisp. Next.
22/01/2020, 17:02 - Rob;: Shit in the 90s. Shit now.
22/01/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: I have a lot time for Chip Sticks
22/01/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: That cheap shitty indulgence
22/01/2020, 17:03 - David;: No one has ever said that
22/01/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: The searing vinegar assault to the gullet
22/01/2020, 17:04 - David;: the only thing I like about them is that it's just possible to swallow them whole and it scours out your entire esophgus
22/01/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
22/01/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: Bit plus point for me too
22/01/2020, 17:04 - David;: Like a scouring brush for your own gullet
22/01/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: Pickled onion monster munch are excellent
22/01/2020, 17:05 - Rob;: I'm just naming crisps here
22/01/2020, 17:05 - David;: Ah but the huge danger they pose to the roof of your mouth
22/01/2020, 17:05 - David;: That can ruin everything
22/01/2020, 17:06 - David;: Too sharp
22/01/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: I use my teeth to break them down before they get there
22/01/2020, 17:06 - David;: It seems you go for a very sharp crisp experience
22/01/2020, 17:06 - David;: I'm a fan of beef space raiders
22/01/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: Yeah, fine
22/01/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: Don't see them a lot. Not metropolitan or elite enough (like Chip Sticks)
22/01/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: Skips. The melting. A really excellent experience
22/01/2020, 17:08 - David;: You find them a lot more in Scotland
22/01/2020, 17:09 - David;: Scotland is very retro with it's crisp selections
22/01/2020, 17:10 - David;: I rate it a lot it's dodged all these new posh fried brands - your Burt's etc.
22/01/2020, 17:11 - David;: I basically think crisp technology peaked in 1995 and it's been downhill since
22/01/2020, 17:15 - Rob;: I don't like kettle chips and overly posh brands
22/01/2020, 17:16 - Jack G;: But walkers max paprika Dave, invented in 1999
22/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: It's an obviously cheap and cheerful foodstuff and you can't hide that
22/01/2020, 17:16 - David;: Yeah same classic mistake people think they are better because of the adult branding
22/01/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Beyond the heaven that is Walkers Sensations Thai Sweet Chilli
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: I will admit them plus Synders pretzels. That's all
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: No
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: Weird chemical taste
22/01/2020, 17:17 - David;: Very cloying
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: Ah yeah, just gumping a huge handful of TSC and swigging a load of Coca-Cola
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: 1/10 at best
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: Find with the weird chemical taste
22/01/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: Again a 1/10
22/01/2020, 17:19 - Jack G;: Walkers max definitely the most common in the wall of empty crisp packets in the metal grating at Chippy school
22/01/2020, 17:20 - David;: Max paprika only a lunch crisp though, you can't have them in the evening
22/01/2020, 17:20 - Rob;: Lol
22/01/2020, 17:20 - David;: Hula hoop beef under-rated. Easy to forget about hula hoops
22/01/2020, 17:20 - Rob;: I had never thought of categorising some as Evening Crisps
22/01/2020, 17:21 - David;: Yeah, like you'd only have sensations in the evening that's not a meal deal option
22/01/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: The joy of having a hula hoop on each finger tip ready to go is real
22/01/2020, 17:21 - David;: Vice versa with the max
22/01/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: What's your crisps per week rate atm Dave?
22/01/2020, 17:22 - David;: Try not to eat mid-week but have the odd packet with lunch when hungry. Mainly do my crisp guzzling at the weekends.
22/01/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: It's really slipped for me. Never been a huge snacker, more driven by frousts or being at home, where my mum still buys crisps as if she has teenage children, than anything else.
22/01/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: Not had any crisps this decade so far
22/01/2020, 17:26 - Jack G;: Nah
22/01/2020, 17:26 - David;: That's no life
22/01/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: Lol
22/01/2020, 17:27 - David;: The crisp is a national delicacy, we've elevated it  to a standard the world envies
22/01/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: Shittest crisp?
22/01/2020, 18:06 - Jack G;: Got to be twiglets
22/01/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: That’s mental. Twiglets are excellent
22/01/2020, 18:07 - Jack G;: Nah they’re awful
22/01/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: Although you are a person who chomps down coriander willingly so not unexpected you’d have poor taste
22/01/2020, 18:08 - Phill: Cheese and onion walkers
22/01/2020, 18:10 - Paul;: McCoy’s Thai sweet chilli - terrible. Crisps should have nothing sweet near them
22/01/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Mcoys sweet chilli chicken fucking GOAT tier
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: Wrong. Trash.
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Jack G;: Next
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: Put shit in bin
22/01/2020, 18:14 - Phill: Stay mad autist
22/01/2020, 18:15 - Jack G;: Bugles definitely top tier
22/01/2020, 18:24 - David;: Plain salted McCoys are always a dissapointment
22/01/2020, 18:25 - David;: McCoys chedder and onion used to be the best of all crisps until they changed the flavour a few years back now average
22/01/2020, 18:35 - Phill: Ready salted french fries are actually the shittest of them all
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Rob;: Anything that's black pepper is shit
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Rob;: In it for the salt, not blunt tongue tingle
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Phill: Agreed, black pepper is shite.
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: Salt and shake. Great plain crisp concept. Do rare
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: *rate
22/01/2020, 18:36 - Rob;: Yeah, do rate
22/01/2020, 18:37 - Rob;: I would like a mini chip chop vinegar bottle in there too
22/01/2020, 18:37 - Phill: Heavy, synthetic cheese based crisps are trash
22/01/2020, 18:37 - Phill: The ones that stain your hands with stinky shit
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Paul;: >Caramelised onion and cheese
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Paul;: >rosemary and thyme
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Phill: >prosecco
22/01/2020, 18:42 - Phill: >gin and tonic
22/01/2020, 19:07 - David;: Agreed, wotsits terrible for that reason
22/01/2020, 19:08 - Rob;: Yeah, wotsits are just packing foam for masochists
22/01/2020, 19:20 - Damian Rumble: One of the best things about being an adult is not have having to ever comprehend eating garbage like Nik naks, space invaders, wotsits, monster munch, skips. All of those contain enough chemicals they are bound to give you a cancer tumour, which is ironic because that is exactly what they look like.
22/01/2020, 19:20 - Rob;: How times change. You only used to eat yellow.
22/01/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Damo what used to be your diet?

22/01/2020, 19:40 - David;: Ah amazing. Will be watching
22/01/2020, 19:49 - David;: The ultimate froust viewing double bill would be this followed by the Theroux saville doc
22/01/2020, 19:49 - Paul;: Warnock has a big saville moment at the beginning
22/01/2020, 19:50 - Paul;: 2min 40 seconds in

22/01/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: Ruining the rhyme of _name's_ with _James_
22/01/2020, 21:49 - Paul;: Isn’t name is the genius of it as it rhymes with the pronunciation of James
22/01/2020, 21:50 - Hamish Sinclair: The whole thing is genius
22/01/2020, 21:51 - David;: Lol nah
22/01/2020, 21:51 - David;: That's baffling
22/01/2020, 21:51 - David;: Why include Rodriguez?
22/01/2020, 21:52 - Paul;: Named after James Bond
22/01/2020, 21:52 - Paul;: Next.
22/01/2020, 21:52 - David;: Also this was when he was playing with James on his back not Rodriguez
22/01/2020, 21:53 - David;: So would make sense without it. But no put that in

23/01/2020, 20:51 - Jack G;: Best just to never use the triple captain at all, always seems to attract failure
23/01/2020, 20:53 - Rob;: Yeah. It's just a troll machine

29/01/2020, 15:00 - Sam;: Fake news
29/01/2020, 16:38 - David;: It was brilliant. I had a great view walking up the stairs behind - decided to vom straight into the wall. Didn't need the toilet. Forget it.
29/01/2020, 16:56 - Rob;: Who's wall was it?
29/01/2020, 17:38 - David;: In that pub that is all the pubs
29/01/2020, 17:39 - David;: To the left is the door to the toilet. So he'd made it that far but no don't need to worry about that.
29/01/2020, 17:40 - David;: Like when you got to the toilet bowl at Paul's but then vommed under it onto the floor
29/01/2020, 17:41 - Rob;: Was same made to stand naked in a bath after in the same way?
29/01/2020, 18:04 - / James Ball: Came back downstairs pistol hands in the air I seem to remember. Complete denial of it occurring
29/01/2020, 18:05 - Sam;: There’s no proof linking me to the picture. The eye witness testimony is from a man who had been DRINKING. My lawyer would rip that to shreds in court.
29/01/2020, 18:16 - Jack G;: Only a guilty party would put together such a strong denial
29/01/2020, 18:26 - Sam;: I demand justice after these wild accusations ‘Jack’.
29/01/2020, 18:53 - David;: You just need to own this. Spin it as a positive thing
29/01/2020, 18:54 - David;: My favourite is still Paul being forced into the shower naked after being accused of shitting himself by the actual shittee

29/01/2020, 20:26 - David;: Sam, this happened
29/01/2020, 20:36 - Phill: Loved going for a piss and random lads talking about the nutter than vommed all over the door

29/01/2020, 21:18 - Rob;: Happens to so many players you'd think the reverse would work more often - your Titus Brambles going to Serie A and tearing it up
29/01/2020, 21:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, turns up in italy and they cant believe how quick he plays
29/01/2020, 21:19 - Rob;: Iago Aspas one example perhaps?
29/01/2020, 21:19 - Rob;: Gervinho at Roma
29/01/2020, 21:19 - Hamish Sinclair: I believe there were messi comparisons
29/01/2020, 21:20 - Rob;: Yeah lol
29/01/2020, 21:29 - David;: Inter are currently managed on this premise
29/01/2020, 21:30 - David;: Apparently Conte lives ex-prem players because they have all been battered into physical endurance

01/02/2020, 08:57 - Rob;: And lop off his balls?
01/02/2020, 08:57 - Rob;: Sorry
01/02/2020, 08:57 - Rob;: Or he's some hairy fat man born with one cock and one vagina but not balls?
01/02/2020, 08:58 - Rob;: And no one thought to mention it now
01/02/2020, 08:58 - Phill: If he did have a vagina, I'd be asking why he didn't just rape himself?
01/02/2020, 08:59 - David;: Yep, it seems like a bollockless cock over a scarred disfigured minge
01/02/2020, 09:00 - Rob;: Perhaps all this time when people thought he was sleazily saying how much he was into sex, he was actually trying to reveal he was intersex? Everyone mishearing him for decades turned him into the groper we know and love

01/02/2020, 16:47 - Jack G;: Declan Rice’s goal against Sheffield ruled out 2 weeks ago for hand ball ridiculously costing us points. Now Glen Murray gets away with the exact same thing against us
01/02/2020, 16:48 - Jack G;: Bullshit, it’s like the refs want us relegated
01/02/2020, 16:57 - Hamish Sinclair: I hear the refs are also conspiring to win liverpool the league?
01/02/2020, 17:00 - Jack G;: Who’s saying that? Not heard it from anyone, especially considering the 18 point gap. Must be Liverpool fans missing being the butthurt underdog

02/02/2020, 12:09 - Phill: There's a title race on
02/02/2020, 12:09 - Rob;: Yeah, this and the triple captain last week has changed everything
02/02/2020, 12:10 - Phill: Hamish also thinks Salah is dog shit so is protesting by not having him. Very much like Dave not hopping on the pukki bandwagon
02/02/2020, 12:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, the decision to hold onto mane and not salah looks pretty shit in hindoght
02/02/2020, 12:13 - Rob;: Yeah, day Mane injury
02/02/2020, 12:13 - Rob;: Dat
02/02/2020, 12:13 - Rob;: Completely ruined me

02/02/2020, 12:27 - David;: The pukki party is over
02/02/2020, 12:51 - Phill: But the points Dave, the points.
02/02/2020, 12:59 - David;: But the lack of points for weeks
02/02/2020, 13:00 - David;: The lack of points
02/02/2020, 13:01 - David;: My new bug bear is De Bruyne, refuse to own him
02/02/2020, 13:31 - Phill: But buy low sell high. Ride the wagon. No one's stopping you getting off.
02/02/2020, 13:45 - David;: That's assuming you exactly judge the end of the wagon though. Usually it's unclear if the wagon has really stopped or just gone over a bump.
02/02/2020, 14:10 - Damian Rumble: Salah has been miss firing all season. Never could have foreseen that he could start scoring goals again
02/02/2020, 14:13 - Jack G;: Man known for scoring goals scores goals
02/02/2020, 14:13 - Jack G;: Gary goals
02/02/2020, 14:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, not having mane in the team also makes more of our play go though him
02/02/2020, 16:24 - David;: Spurs will be expecting a Bergwijn here

02/02/2020, 22:06 - Jack G;: Agreed, the only exception being pain au chocolat
02/02/2020, 22:06 - Rob;: I can leave that too
02/02/2020, 22:14 - / James Ball: I'm a fan of the chocolate pain but not sure about this

05/02/2020, 09:36 - David;: Also had a good episode on the 18th century gin craze
05/02/2020, 09:36 - Phill: Life scientific, inside science, the science hour
05/02/2020, 09:38 - David;: Also thinking allowed is quite good. Depends on the episode.

05/02/2020, 21:29 - Paul;: Unconnected. Solo journey home
05/02/2020, 21:38 - Sam;: He’s done well then. I wouldn’t discarded trousers and shoes before the journey but at least he doesn’t have to put them in his own bin
05/02/2020, 22:32 - Paul;: I like that they haven’t been put off by it too much either
05/02/2020, 22:33 - Paul;: Not keeping what would normally be a safe distance in that situation

06/02/2020, 08:48 - David;: Surely shart-casual?
06/02/2020, 08:57 - David;: The issue I can see with his situation is not having keys or a wallet

06/02/2020, 17:58 - Paul;: The fact it’s such a complete wreck as well
06/02/2020, 17:58 - Paul;: Cut off and reattached. No other explanation
07/02/2020, 10:09 - David;: So Haaland is a 2 goal per game striker now.
07/02/2020, 10:09 - David;: He's just doing that.
07/02/2020, 10:09 - Jack G;: Sancho tearing Bundesliga apart as well, got a lot of time for this Dortmund team
07/02/2020, 10:20 - David;: Shame Sterling has turned shit and Kane injured
07/02/2020, 11:34 - Phill: Work today - from a harness. Absailing. Shart in my pants.

08/02/2020, 10:24 - / James Ball: Another find on my browsing the internet was an office that kept a list of one particular guy's various claims he's made over the years
08/02/2020, 10:26 - / James Ball: - Once jumped out of a chinook helicopter into the North Sea

- Was the first person in the UK to buy a playstation3

- Walked while drunk from Liverpool to Warrington in under 3 hours
08/02/2020, 10:27 - / James Ball: - Installed Robbie Fowler's bathroom
08/02/2020, 10:30 - / James Ball: - Was once on a job installing radiators when the customer had to leave unexpectedly. With one radiator left to install the customer left him with the instruction not to enter a specified room. When the customer left, he entered said room and thereupon found a live, fully grown tiger lying on the couch.
08/02/2020, 10:43 - David;: Yeah yeah I'm only ever one installation away from a relapse. I could never allow myself 'just one season'

08/02/2020, 17:15 - David;: That can't just be a single lager doing that
08/02/2020, 17:36 - Phill: It was the volume of food.
08/02/2020, 17:36 - Phill: Followed by a quick lager
08/02/2020, 17:36 - Phill: Which killed me.

08/02/2020, 18:25 - Sam;: Huge rematch. Heavy weight belt on the line. I cannot fucking wait
08/02/2020, 18:31 - David;: So it's not small?
08/02/2020, 18:31 - David;: There's scope?
08/02/2020, 18:32 - David;: Who won the first?
08/02/2020, 18:32 - Sam;: Controversial draw as many thought the points decision shouldn’t gone to Fury
08/02/2020, 18:37 - David;: Is Joshua over now?
08/02/2020, 18:38 - David;: Losing to the little fat bloke. Hard to come back from
08/02/2020, 18:50 - Sam;: Nah, he’s working his way back, beat the little fella to win back the belts so he back to be the man to beat. The winner of wilder fury will likely fight Joshua to see who becomes the undisputed heavy weight champion of the world (holds all heavyweight belts)
08/02/2020, 19:09 - David;: But the little fat fella
08/02/2020, 19:09 - David;: That's a real stain on the record

09/02/2020, 17:09 - Damian Rumble: It's the winter break period right? They can easily reschedule the match for next weekend and it still be part of the same game week
09/02/2020, 18:18 - Jack G;: No idea why everyone keeps going on about this “winter break”
09/02/2020, 18:18 - Jack G;: 4 games this weekend? There are games next weekend too...

09/02/2020, 19:26 - David;: But no teams playing both so everyone gets at least 2 full weeks between games
09/02/2020, 19:26 - David;: They've staggered it
09/02/2020, 19:33 - Jack G;: Hardly a break though. A proper winter break we’re talking 3 weeks off for all teams.
09/02/2020, 20:32 - Damian Rumble: Rachel Pearson married Stuart Kench today. Wrap your noging around that one....

12/02/2020, 20:39 - Rob;: Yeah
12/02/2020, 20:39 - David;: Went to field day there the line up was great but sound quality ruined a lot of it
12/02/2020, 20:39 - David;: Four tet, beach house etc.
12/02/2020, 20:41 - Rob;: Those APE gigs have a really horrible vibe where it feels like it's been planned according to what Alan Sugar thinks Glastonbury might be like
12/02/2020, 20:41 - David;: Yes
12/02/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: The money man's idea of what the kids are into
12/02/2020, 20:42 - David;: Exactly the same with field day
12/02/2020, 20:42 - David;: Good description
12/02/2020, 20:42 - David;: Very artificial corporate vibe. A lot of board meetings and market research have happened
12/02/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: Worth going to if you live the band, but you've got to get in the right bit of the crowd to enjoy it
12/02/2020, 20:43 - David;: Generally urban festivals not a fan.
12/02/2020, 20:43 - Rob;: 'what will look like people are having fun in pictures'

13/02/2020, 16:59 - Damian Rumble: A very underwhelming reshuffle. Really hoping to see the back of Patel and Raab. Looks like Boris is going to be  quite happy to take us to WTO rules in 2021...

14/02/2020, 21:01 - David;: Dat VAR decision though
14/02/2020, 21:01 - Rob;: Yeah fuck that
14/02/2020, 21:01 - Rob;: It's a Friday night, let it slide
14/02/2020, 21:06 - Jack G;: Does this mean that 5th place get champions league assuming city finish in top 4?
14/02/2020, 21:06 - Jack G;: Also. Hopefully city will be depressed and we’ll beat them on Wednesday
14/02/2020, 21:14 - David;: Presumably? Would love wolves or Sheffield to have a cheeky shot at the champs league
14/02/2020, 21:15 - David;: But obviously United will grot into 5th somehow despite being woeful
14/02/2020, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: Does that mean not even Europa League for city?
14/02/2020, 22:47 - Damian Rumble: Could be big for the league next year

16/02/2020, 01:54 - Paul;: Love island killing everyone
16/02/2020, 08:56 - Rob;: Yeah, them and the tabloids. There have been ~175 contestants and 3 presenters, with 1.7% of them committing suicide
16/02/2020, 08:58 - Rob;: Which is about 166 x the national suicide rate

16/02/2020, 12:30 - / James Ball: I think it's that 46 people were killed by various accidents - top many to list individually
16/02/2020, 12:32 - / James Ball: "Rising of the lights" no idea what that is but apparently 98 people died of it
16/02/2020, 13:51 - Rob;: There is apparently talk of City being given a points reduction for 2013/14

16/02/2020, 13:53 - Rob;: Would be quite an odd way to take the shine off of Liverpool winning it in style this year: err, actually you technically ended your generation wait to win win the league 6 years ago you just didn't know about it
16/02/2020, 13:53 - Jack G;: Wouldn’t that give coutinho a league medal too?
16/02/2020, 13:54 - Rob;: Would you do a second bus tour for that league win? Get all the old players back for it
16/02/2020, 13:54 - Jack G;: I imagine they’d just say there was no winner that season tbh
16/02/2020, 13:55 - Rob;: Nah. I want Liverpool to have to awkwardly celebrate
16/02/2020, 14:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah, wed  celebrate this league title and then celebrate drawing level with utd on 20 league titles
16/02/2020, 14:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Becoming officially the most successful team in england within 1 season
16/02/2020, 14:25 - Rob;: Two league titles, one cup

17/02/2020, 20:02 - David;: Ighalo. The big money Marquee signing
17/02/2020, 20:03 - Sam;: Marquee as in quarantine tent?
17/02/2020, 20:03 - David;: Could randomly work due to the complete lack of expectation
17/02/2020, 20:03 - David;: Yeah isn't he at risk of coronavirus? But still fit to make the bench
17/02/2020, 20:04 - David;: Don't really get it. Seems like a stop gap squad filler but then just bring through the boy greenwood
17/02/2020, 20:05 - Sam;: He’s our fox. We will release him into opposition boxes to kill their chickens (drink their milkshake) (score goals).

He just eases the pressure on the boy greenwood, only 18. 

He was quarantined for a week as a precautionary measure when he arrived in the UK.
17/02/2020, 20:06 - David;: The diseased fox in the hen house
17/02/2020, 20:07 - David;: Give the defenders coronavirus then score
17/02/2020, 20:07 - Sam;: Yeah yeah. double bubble.

Injury or red card in this game
17/02/2020, 20:11 - David;: On paper this seems like your strongest defence
17/02/2020, 20:12 - David;: Big black guy, slabhead Roy of the rivers English bloke, crossing men on either side. That's a classic
17/02/2020, 20:13 - David;: Glove butler behind
17/02/2020, 20:13 - Sam;: Yeah yeah. Bailly should be a monster.
17/02/2020, 20:15 - David;: Midfield - running man, blocker and passing man. Also quite classic
17/02/2020, 20:16 - David;: The issue is no forwards
17/02/2020, 20:26 - Sam;: Yeah, and martial doing his impression of the invisible man
17/02/2020, 20:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Batshuayi comically baf
17/02/2020, 20:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Bad
17/02/2020, 20:33 - David;: Batshitty

17/02/2020, 20:45 - Sam;: Martial becomes VISIBLE
17/02/2020, 21:00 - David;: Lol the Vauxhall Corsa ad
17/02/2020, 21:02 - David;: 'some people say I can do better than a Vauxhall Corsa. But who listens to some people'
17/02/2020, 21:03 - David;: Basically admitting your car will be a social embarrassment
17/02/2020, 21:22 - Sam;: Lol. I know people mock will mock you for this but come on. It’s cheap. Like you
17/02/2020, 22:14 - David;: Lol Maguire 'i was just trying to prop him up'
17/02/2020, 22:14 - David;: Just propping him up by the ball sack with my studs
17/02/2020, 22:14 - David;: Trying to help him actually
17/02/2020, 22:16 - Sam;: It was for his safety actually.
17/02/2020, 22:17 - Sam;: Just rest your bollocks on my studs
17/02/2020, 22:19 - David;: Just offering you a nice comfy studded platform to break your fall onto
17/02/2020, 22:21 - David;: I hate for him to land on this verdant soft turf

18/02/2020, 13:27 - Jack G;: Dortmund vs PSG is pretty big later
18/02/2020, 17:21 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/02/2020, 17:55 - David;: Um Jack are you broken? Liverpool vs Athletico
18/02/2020, 17:55 - David;: The champions of Europe are playing
18/02/2020, 17:56 - Hamish Sinclair: *world
18/02/2020, 17:56 - Hamish Sinclair: I believe
18/02/2020, 17:56 - David;: Ah yes sorry the World champions Jack
18/02/2020, 17:56 - Jack G;: That’s got 1-0 written all over it. I’m after some goals
18/02/2020, 18:01 - David;: Have you inferred that from the time we beat Roma 7-6, the time we beat Barca 4-3, the time we beat Porto 6-1 or the time we beat Manchester city 5-1?
18/02/2020, 18:02 - Jack G;: More to do with atletico famously being a defensive team and first legs always being tentative affairs
18/02/2020, 18:02 - Hamish Sinclair: I agree
18/02/2020, 18:03 - Hamish Sinclair: PSG vs dortmund would have been my pick of the rest
18/02/2020, 18:04 - David;: Kieren trippier vs Mane. Back goals there
18/02/2020, 18:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Trippier injured
18/02/2020, 19:42 - David;: Lol dat convoluted mourinho stair metaphor
18/02/2020, 21:36 - Jack G;: Haaland is so good damn
18/02/2020, 21:37 - David;: Jack's predictions accurate tbf
18/02/2020, 21:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Haaland is like a real life cheat code
18/02/2020, 21:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Would love to see psg go out
18/02/2020, 21:42 - Jack G;: Yeah. Surely they must be looking at a ban similar to City? They’re just as bad
18/02/2020, 21:59 - David;: That second Haaland goal
18/02/2020, 22:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Lol Robertson's interview, never seen a man so angry
18/02/2020, 22:26 - Hamish Sinclair: They didnt have their emails hacked though
18/02/2020, 22:36 - Phill: Damo, how does it feel to know that I'm a superforecaster because I predicted Brexit, trump, boris? And all you data monkeys can't predict shit and I just sit here high and predict everything?
18/02/2020, 22:39 - Hamish Sinclair: "That's what I do, I smoke gange and I predict things"
18/02/2020, 23:23 - Damian Rumble: 👍
19/02/2020, 11:15 - Rob;: Wenger's little offside proposal could change everything
19/02/2020, 11:16 - Jack G;: Yeah seen that. Surely would completely render the offside trap useless
19/02/2020, 11:16 - Jack G;: Could see the return of the sweeper
19/02/2020, 11:17 - Rob;: You'd be onside if any part of you that you are allowed to score with is onside, so you could just have the toe of your trailing leg behind the defender and your head feet ahead
19/02/2020, 11:17 - Rob;: Not a small tweak to bring in just before an international tournament
19/02/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: Pace would get huge
19/02/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: Pace and giraffe necks
19/02/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: Theo Walcrouch the new Messi
19/02/2020, 12:10 - Sam;: nah that just shifts the issue the other way. you could be onside by a toe but have the whole rest of your body 2/3 feet offside. that's to easy for attackers.
19/02/2020, 12:19 - Paul;: What’s the solution?
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Rob;: This
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Rob;: As in that's Wenger's proposal
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Jack G;: Keep it as it is but give benefit of the doubt to attackers
19/02/2020, 12:20 - Rob;: It would be a huge shift towards favouring attackers
19/02/2020, 12:21 - Jack G;: Also, would make it harder for linesmen to judge offside surely?
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Paul;: But as Sambo says that just flips the issue the other way?
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Sam;: it's all fucked as the linesman cant judge to the same accuracy as VAR anyway so the whole thing needs rethinking..
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Sam;: A TOE.
19/02/2020, 12:22 - Sam;: AN ARMPIT
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Sam;: ruining the game
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Jack G;: How about all players where full body sensor gear and offsides are judged by the rumbletron?
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Jack G;: Wear*
19/02/2020, 12:23 - Jack G;: Instant decision
19/02/2020, 12:24 - Sam;: or ask fifa how they do it on the game..
19/02/2020, 12:24 - Paul;: You should have a challenge like in tennis. Each team gets so many per game and can refer to VAR otherwise ref decisions stand
19/02/2020, 12:26 - Sam;: i think offside is it's own issue within VAR. On every decision where VAR wants to call it the other way, the ref should have to go to the pitch side monitor to make a final decision. players would accept that and fans would know what's going on again. ref's checkin bruv.
19/02/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: Nah that’s shit. Slows down everything
19/02/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: Just got to hobble over here to watch the game again on the monitor
19/02/2020, 12:27 - Sam;: Why’s he hobbling?
19/02/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: He’s a ref
19/02/2020, 12:28 - Jack G;: Have you seen Jonathan Moss?
19/02/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 12:36 - Paul;: Huge anus becomes big component of the game?
19/02/2020, 12:36 - Paul;: This plays right into the hands of the anal sock
19/02/2020, 12:36 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 12:39 - Rob;: Well yeah, if you had a 5 foot anal sock you would basically always be through on goal
19/02/2020, 12:40 - Rob;: Would lead to incredibly deep defending
19/02/2020, 13:14 - Paul;: Long light weight anus highly prized in a striker
19/02/2020, 13:38 - Paul;: The luck of being born with dat sleek aerodynamic anus
19/02/2020, 13:38 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 14:12 - Paul;: The agent for Haaland got paid more than the actual transfer fee for Haaland. Apparently. Huge market for agents. Worth more than the players.
19/02/2020, 14:13 - Sam;: agent Mina Riaola. they trolling united. he's Pogba's agent.
19/02/2020, 14:13 - Paul;: Haalands dad got €10m in the deal as well
19/02/2020, 14:14 - Paul;: Everyone’s got there fingers in him
19/02/2020, 14:14 - Sam;: what's your source? the transfer value was 17 mill.
19/02/2020, 14:14 - Paul;: You don’t need to know the source, this is apparently what happened
19/02/2020, 14:15 - Paul;: That’s why Haaland was cheap because everyone else was snuffling his money
19/02/2020, 14:16 - Rob;: Snuffling Salzburg's money more like
19/02/2020, 14:17 - Rob;: Would be great is he had more allegiance to Leeds than to Norway
19/02/2020, 14:17 - Rob;: Not England, Yorkshire
19/02/2020, 17:19 - Phill: <Media omitted>
19/02/2020, 17:19 - Phill: Happy hour. Pelican. £5.90 for all this loot.
19/02/2020, 18:06 - Damian Rumble: Probably couldn't get a pint for that in some parts of London..
19/02/2020, 18:11 - Damian Rumble: I think surely a combination of the two. Offside is only ruled when part of body that you can score a goal with is ahead of the final defender. VAR calls for a review but the review and decision is made by the ref and linesmen on the big screen in the stadium where everyone can see (rather than wasting time by trotting over to a separate monitor and preventing everyone there from seeing why a decision was made).
19/02/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Stay liberal elite.
19/02/2020, 19:19 - Sam;: No, on offside it’s totally down to the little laptop cunts drawing the lines, ref not involved. And no again, the big screen is for the fans to see it, the ref goes pitchside. 

A delay where we can see the ref pitchside is better and more dramatic to watch than him standing still expressionless with his jebby little finger to his 👂
19/02/2020, 19:25 - Jack G;: Why not change it so the offside rule only includes from your foot. Makes more sense, you’re not gaining an advantage by your bonce being offside, and makes the line drawing easier and more consistent as it would always be from the toe
19/02/2020, 19:38 - Paul;: The idea of a limited number of challenges is clearly better. Works for other sports
19/02/2020, 19:38 - Paul;: Vote Paul’s VAR solution now
20/02/2020, 09:16 - David;: BBC News - Fashion Institute apologises for 'clearly racist' show
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-51564215
20/02/2020, 09:34 - David;: On offside, answer is twofold. Stop drawing the shitty litty crayon lines and have it reffed by human eye as the law was written to be. Second apply the same standard to overturning offside as other decisions already get in VAR, that it has to be clear and obvious to overturn onpitch decision
20/02/2020, 09:35 - David;: Why is that principle used for some decisions but offside policed to the millimeter. It's inconsistent
20/02/2020, 09:36 - Rob;: Yeah
20/02/2020, 09:36 - David;: Felt tip pens smeared over a screen have no place in the game
20/02/2020, 09:37 - Rob;: I quite like the forward vs linesman battle too
20/02/2020, 09:38 - Rob;: Fine to have a system to guard against huge link fuck ups, but give the tubby man with a flag a break and lay off the mm bullshit
20/02/2020, 09:38 - Rob;: *lino fuck ups
20/02/2020, 09:38 - David;: Yeah exactly. Just overturn the obvious howler
20/02/2020, 09:38 - David;: That's what they do with pennos already

21/02/2020, 10:34 - Rob;: It's Klopp who's striking up friendships with children
21/02/2020, 10:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Nah hes just a great bloke. Klopp'l fix it
21/02/2020, 10:38 - David;: Awful, awful decent
21/02/2020, 12:25 - Damian Rumble: I reckon there should be some kind of bogus trophy that is given to ever comes last in the Jules chippet. Only it's something extremely unpleasant... Like one of Phil's shits incased in a clear plastic box and with people's names engraved on the side of it..
21/02/2020, 12:25 - Hamish Sinclair: I definitely think something to keep the bottom playing would be a good idea
21/02/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: I’ve got a huge tactic to get back on top anyway. Not worried. Next.
21/02/2020, 12:29 - Jack G;: Play a wild card and copy my team?
21/02/2020, 12:29 - Hamish Sinclair: As an extreme example, someone I know is in a league with 20 people. They all put £10 in. They buy a random cheap Eurostar day return ticket for the end of the season to a random destination and the losing player has to go to that city in full goalkeeper kit (and gloves) and drink three beers in 3 different bars before returning.

The rest if the money goes to 1st place  2nd gets his stake
21/02/2020, 12:30 - Paul;: Why would I copy the losing team?
21/02/2020, 12:30 - Jack G;: Can’t get less points than me if we get the same points
21/02/2020, 12:30 - Paul;: I have aspirations higher than second last
21/02/2020, 12:31 - Hamish Sinclair: The low block
21/02/2020, 12:31 - Jack G;: Classic
21/02/2020, 12:31 - Paul;: I refuse to stoop to jacks level
21/02/2020, 12:32 - Paul;: I should triple captain salah against West Ham
21/02/2020, 12:33 - Jack G;: Sounds great
21/02/2020, 12:33 - Jack G;: Do you have to wear football boots as well?
21/02/2020, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: I dont know, would surely add to the comedy value though
21/02/2020, 12:34 - Hamish Sinclair: The gloves are the best bit
21/02/2020, 12:41 - Jack G;: Still can’t get over how insane the quality is in Jules Chippet this season. I’m on track to score 1992 points which is 140 higher than my average score in the season, yet I’m bottom
21/02/2020, 14:57 - Damian Rumble: Love it... Though a free trip abroad is not much of a punishment for giving up in November
21/02/2020, 14:58 - Damian Rumble: Is it the tactical nonce?
21/02/2020, 16:19 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/02/2020, 16:19 - David;: Ah, this tickled me

21/02/2020, 18:51 - Phill: Lol you the definition of a mug son
21/02/2020, 19:44 - Sam;: Damo, phil would only be triggered if you were getting lower, non-London prices in London
21/02/2020, 19:44 - Sam;: Which you most certainly are not

21/02/2020, 19:51 - Phill: Lol is that £9.49 service?
21/02/2020, 19:51 - Phill: You're a fucking chump
21/02/2020, 19:51 - Phill: I can get 4 pints for that
21/02/2020, 20:03 - Rob;: Why are you paying service on drinks?
21/02/2020, 20:05 - Damian Rumble: Yeah but do your Friday night drinks come with the smug satisfaction of being part of the liberal elite?
21/02/2020, 20:05 - Damian Rumble: Can't put a price on that...
21/02/2020, 20:06 - Rob;: Damo you're a huge chump here
21/02/2020, 20:08 - Phill: No, they come with satisfaction that somewhere, some idiot, is drinking the same thing and paying 3x as much.
21/02/2020, 20:12 - Phill: £82.49
21/02/2020, 20:17 - Sam;: Christ. That particular receipt.
21/02/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
21/02/2020, 20:23 - Paul;: Throwing up in her mouth 40 times to get moisture?
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Sam;: That’s my favourite bit.
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Sam;: The only way to survive
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: I wonder how quickly she started doing that?
21/02/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: First 30mins
21/02/2020, 20:27 - Paul;: Knowing her husband would be back as well from the night shift
21/02/2020, 20:28 - Sam;: Tormented by bbc news on loop
21/02/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: Throwing up every 18mins on average
21/02/2020, 20:33 - Rob;: How has she convinced herself that throwing up is a method of dehydration?
21/02/2020, 20:33 - Rob;: *rehydration
21/02/2020, 20:34 - Rob;: Removing and putting it back in the same place
21/02/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: Very bott brain approach
21/02/2020, 20:36 - Sam;: Yeah yeah, by the third time she’s surely already voming painful and disgusting bile
21/02/2020, 20:37 - Paul;: And how can she just vom on command
21/02/2020, 20:37 - Rob;: Lying on the bed on top of your arm. Why not on the floor?
21/02/2020, 21:06 - David;: That reciept
21/02/2020, 21:08 - David;: My bottle of alsatian reisling for the evening cost less than for someone to pour you a couple of g and ts
21/02/2020, 21:09 - Jack G;: How can anyone charge £11 for a glass of tonic with a straight face
21/02/2020, 21:21 - Paul;: Wonder how long until Coronavirus sweeps through the uk
21/02/2020, 21:22 - Damian Rumble: Already had it. No big deal
21/02/2020, 21:22 - Sam;: We’re doing better at containment than the he filthy Chinese
21/02/2020, 21:23 - Paul;: Reckon it’s going to get very bad very soon
21/02/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: Nah
21/02/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: Fine
21/02/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: 98% chance of living, without taking into account how healthy you are
21/02/2020, 21:35 - Paul;: But all the coughing around you you’d have to deal with. The spluttering
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Paul;: Those people with really annoying coughs
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: Right, didn't realize that was your definition of very bad
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Phill: Hopefully it will wipe out London
21/02/2020, 21:36 - Paul;: 60% infected 2% dead. That would be my very bad situation
21/02/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: 60% of the whole UK?
21/02/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: Yeah
21/02/2020, 21:42 - Rob;: So common cold levels of infection?
21/02/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: Yeah. Haven’t had a cold in a few years. Think I’m immune now
21/02/2020, 21:43 - Rob;: But you're expecting this to just rifle through mist of the population
21/02/2020, 21:44 - Rob;: More virulent than brexit
21/02/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: Yeah. Couldn’t predict that. Won’t predict this
21/02/2020, 22:21 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/02/2020, 22:22 - David;: Predicting the grottiest most negative techiest 0-0 ever. Somehow they've given me 37-1 on that

21/02/2020, 22:46 - Rob;: And all they got was a distinctive lip for it
21/02/2020, 22:47 - Rob;: And the resulting child fucking his niece
21/02/2020, 22:48 - Sam;: uncle-niece is the grottiest. Having to look your brother of sister in the eye and acknowledge that
21/02/2020, 22:52 - Stefan;: Makes family gatherings more manageable though
21/02/2020, 22:52 - / James Ball: Also some of the age differences
21/02/2020, 22:52 - Paul;: Very efficient really
21/02/2020, 22:52 - Rob;: Thanks to the magic of portraiture they don't really look very similar
21/02/2020, 22:53 - Rob;: But do you owe your uncle-cousin-brother-father 4 presents?
21/02/2020, 22:54 - / James Ball: 56 and 27 - the ages of Charles II parents when he was born
21/02/2020, 22:54 - Stefan;: Yeah, he's got only 2 ultimate ancestors but you can trace back 4, 5 or 6 generations to them depending on the route
21/02/2020, 22:54 - Rob;: Nah there are more ancestors
21/02/2020, 22:55 - Rob;: Three sets of parents missing from the second row
21/02/2020, 22:57 - Paul;: It’s just so efficient though. Really streamlined the old family tree
22/02/2020, 07:04 - Paul;: Jack what are your thoughts on the Mercedes DAS system?
22/02/2020, 07:34 - Damian Rumble: Potentially going to guarantee they another Hamilton white wash off a season. Boring
22/02/2020, 07:35 - Jack G;: I think it’s a pretty cool tech tbh. No idea why they’re going to ban it next year when they’re supposed to be a sport of innovation

22/02/2020, 16:16 - Phill: Lundstrom?
22/02/2020, 16:27 - David;: and Ake and Hayden and Connolly

23/02/2020, 17:15 - Jack G;: Rob. How big is Saka?
23/02/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: Big potential
23/02/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: 11 assists or something this season, having not played all the games
23/02/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: One of the few highlights of the season
23/02/2020, 17:31 - Jack G;: Could be huge, tierny Saka on the left could’ve good for a while
23/02/2020, 17:33 - Rob;: Yeah, if he can keep this up and Tierney comes back and stays fit, then those two would be great, and allow Auba to go back in the middle too
23/02/2020, 19:08 - David;: Lacazette ded?
23/02/2020, 19:19 - Rob;: In and out due to poor form

https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-51618959
24/02/2020, 20:58 - David;: What I liked about this was the alibi he chose. 'Whall, a sports therapist, maintained throughout the trial that he was having sex with a man in a field on the night Mr Corrigan was shot.'
24/02/2020, 20:59 - David;: Why cottaging as the go-to innocent explanation?
24/02/2020, 21:01 - David;: 'I couldn't have murdered that man because I was having cuckold BDSM intercourse in my sex dungeon several miles away'
24/02/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: Has anyone ever used a murder as an alibi for another murder?
24/02/2020, 21:11 - Paul;: A lesser murder. Could get away without a prison sentence

24/02/2020, 22:04 - Paul;: Only 4 games needed to win the title
24/02/2020, 22:05 - Paul;: Could be Sunday 22nd March
24/02/2020, 22:06 - David;: Fabianski trolled you there
24/02/2020, 22:06 - David;: But also had a good game paradoxically
24/02/2020, 22:08 - Jack G;: Yeah he made a couple of bad mistakes but also a couple of goal saving saves. Perfectly balanced

26/02/2020, 15:04 - David;: Similar gameplay mechanics
26/02/2020, 17:35 - Damian Rumble: As in there are special characters who are charging around the world trying to solve things
26/02/2020, 17:35 - Damian Rumble: Or that a team of people are supposed to be trying to stop the virus but in reality all actions are dominated by the couple who have spent weeks playing it together
26/02/2020, 17:38 - David;: Sounds like you have had a bitter experience
26/02/2020, 17:39 - Phill: I can smell the butthurt

26/02/2020, 18:18 - Stefan;: Is this going to be "the tree that owns itself" all over again?

26/02/2020, 18:34 - David;: It's political correctness gone mad

26/02/2020, 19:35 - David;: Dat city team
26/02/2020, 19:38 - David;: Two such cuntish clubs
26/02/2020, 19:45 - Jack G;: Don’t know why Foden doesn’t get more game time, he needs to move to a proper team
26/02/2020, 19:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Agree
26/02/2020, 20:53 - David;: So cats are like mini lions. My idea: we need domesticated mini giraffes, zebras, hippos etc. so you get a complete ecosystem playing out in your house
26/02/2020, 20:53 - David;: Equivalent scale to cats
26/02/2020, 20:53 - Hamish Sinclair: The micro hippo would probably be quite agressibe
26/02/2020, 20:54 - David;: Yeah
26/02/2020, 20:54 - David;: But who thought a small lion would be viable?
26/02/2020, 20:55 - David;: Cats very much have class and sharp teeth. We managed to make that work
26/02/2020, 20:55 - David;: *claws
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: I think basically everything that can be domesticated, already has been
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: Cats weren't domesticated from anything even close to as aggressive or powerful as a lion
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: And people have tried to domesticate zebras with no luck due to their aggression
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: Hippos definitely out - they kill more people than any other animal
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: We basically have mini domesticated zebras, but unfortunately they're not stripey, they're Shetland ponies
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: By if you just want tiny versions with all their natural habits, then there are already pygmy hippos, i guess if someone could be bothered you could just keep selectively breeding the smaller ones
26/02/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: Small is probably always attainable with enough work, but tame probably isn't
26/02/2020, 21:32 - Hamish Sinclair: To make tame dont you need to create a selection pressure where the animal benefits from human companionship over generations
26/02/2020, 21:36 - David;: No but has to be to scale with cats Rob. That's the whole premise
26/02/2020, 21:37 - David;: So the giraffe is coming up to your thigh or so
26/02/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: Yeah, and there has to be some tame behaviour to select for in the first place
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: How did the cats become small?
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: Or was it the Lions that went big?
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: What came first?
26/02/2020, 21:40 - David;: We need to emulate what happened with the cats
26/02/2020, 21:45 - Rob;: Nature had already made them cat sized
26/02/2020, 21:45 - Rob;: They didn't some from lions
26/02/2020, 21:45 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah dave we didnt just start feeding some lions and end up with cats

26/02/2020, 21:46 - Rob;: Yes, but far back, and they split independantly of human intervention
26/02/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: Split about 11 million years ago apparently
26/02/2020, 21:47 - Paul;: You can’t lose a cat
26/02/2020, 21:48 - Rob;: At least 4 million years between humans and chimps split
26/02/2020, 21:53 - Rob;: Before, not between
26/02/2020, 21:56 - David;: Yeah so just artificially recreate the same process
26/02/2020, 21:57 - David;: Expose them to similar pressures. Done. Bonzai giraffes/hippos/impalas
26/02/2020, 21:58 - David;: Basically choose the smallest giraffes from each generation and breed them together. Eventually you'll get there  Rob
26/02/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Sure, yeah, possibly. Find the land and money for it,  spend a hundred years on it and I promise i'll buy one
26/02/2020, 22:00 - David;: This is a long term vision.
26/02/2020, 22:00 - David;: But we need to start working on it now
26/02/2020, 22:01 - David;: I'd also like scaled down Chimps hanging off the book shelves etc.
26/02/2020, 22:01 - Rob;: It would be less effort to breed humans bigger
26/02/2020, 22:01 - Rob;: Only one species then
26/02/2020, 22:02 - David;: No but then having to rebuild every house and re-engineer the entire infrastructure
26/02/2020, 22:02 - David;: Big costs there
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Paul;: Could we breed gigantic fruit flies quickly? You can get through generations quickly?
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Rob;: Yes
26/02/2020, 22:02 - David;: But that sounds awful
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Paul;: Make small things big
26/02/2020, 22:02 - Paul;: Let the gnat have its day
26/02/2020, 22:03 - Rob;: Although insects breathe via diffusion, so are limited by oxygen concentration, at current levels oxygen can't reach the middle of organisms much bigger than a tarantula without a circulatory system
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Paul;: So you can get tarantula sized fruit flies
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Rob;: In the dinosaur's day there was more oxygen, so dragonflies were more than a metre long
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Rob;: Perhaps
26/02/2020, 22:04 - Paul;: The appeal is not too high
26/02/2020, 22:04 - David;: Make the weak things huge and the predators tiny until it's a fair fight
26/02/2020, 22:04 - David;: Even everything out
26/02/2020, 22:05 - Paul;: What’s a small thing we can actually make big quickly? Mice?
26/02/2020, 22:05 - Rob;: Well that is the strategy of big herbivores already
26/02/2020, 22:05 - David;: So a robin sized Hawk is having to take on a cat sized vole
26/02/2020, 22:06 - Rob;: The strategy of the other sis just to have so many offspring it doesn't matter how many get eaten
26/02/2020, 22:07 - Paul;: Have you watched the documentary on iplayer on CRISPR? Scope.
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: No, but Crispr gets big PR
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Huge documentary
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: I'll watch
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Change everything
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Engineer our small animals
26/02/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: It was just coming in about my last year of uni, billed as huge then
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: Yeah it’s massive
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: You can edit dna
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: Using a snipping cell thing
26/02/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: CAS 9
26/02/2020, 22:10 - Paul;: A protein that snips
26/02/2020, 22:10 - Rob;: What we need are artificial wombs. Then with DNA editing you could make anything
26/02/2020, 22:12 - Rob;: Thing is DNA is weird. No one designed it. It's mental to observe. Huge stretches of seemingly incising information. Double, treble feedback loops. It's not very intuitive from a human perspective, which makes editing it it. Slow process of trial and error
26/02/2020, 22:12 - Rob;: *seemingly uncoding information
26/02/2020, 22:12 - Paul;: Some guy tries to claim he came up with it making yoghurt and he has the number plate CRISPR for good measure
26/02/2020, 22:21 - David;: BBC News - Joe Biden drops claim he was arrested seeing Mandela

27/02/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: Sliding into the side car
27/02/2020, 22:26 - David;: At what level might she get involved. Semi finals?
27/02/2020, 22:26 - David;: Finals?
27/02/2020, 22:26 - David;: You'd force her to watch a final surely
27/02/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: Watching is a bit different to going
27/02/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: I've taken her to one League cup game
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Was it vs liverpool? What an introduction
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: But TV games she's more up for, she'll do a Spurs derby or any big one of it means I'll have to go to the pub on my own if she doesn't come
27/02/2020, 22:28 - David;: Ah you're at the stadium for this?
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: Yeah
27/02/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: ...and we're out

27/02/2020, 22:29 - David;: How's that happened
27/02/2020, 22:29 - David;: That's the one thing you needed not to happen
27/02/2020, 22:30 - David;: You'd be calling that very poor defending
27/02/2020, 22:32 - Paul;: So now you go and drown your sorrows and come back a rotten stinking mess?
27/02/2020, 22:33 - David;: Ah Auba as well
27/02/2020, 22:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah the aubameyang chance
27/02/2020, 22:33 - David;: Fuck that
27/02/2020, 22:33 - Hamish Sinclair: I swear that went in
27/02/2020, 22:34 - David;: You'd dwell on that
27/02/2020, 22:34 - David;: That will stay with you
27/02/2020, 22:34 - Paul;: How much of a powerhouse are olympiakos?

28/02/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: Old news. It's hundreds of millions of light years away happened ages ago
28/02/2020, 17:21 - David;: Is it old news ifthe information couldn't physically have reached you sooner?
28/02/2020, 17:22 - David;: Are all archaeology discoveries old news by definition?
28/02/2020, 17:23 - Rob;: Yep
28/02/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: I like how I'd there are other civilisations many light years away observing the universe they will have a completely different picture
28/02/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: Like they're getting light from the earth before it even had a moon
28/02/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: Everyone's intel is woefully shit
28/02/2020, 17:27 - David;: Galaxy could already have been half taken over by a tyrranid swarm. We'd be none the wiser.
28/02/2020, 17:29 - David;: Can't wait for the Andromeda Galaxy to pass through us
28/02/2020, 17:33 - David;: Apparently betelgeuse is going to explode. So we may lose Orion's left shoulder.
28/02/2020, 17:33 - David;: Replaced by a giant dust cloud
28/02/2020, 17:54 - Damian Rumble: Kind of novel but it's not a treatment of how well an academic was able to dress up story about some slightly misshaped galaxies
28/02/2020, 17:55 - Damian Rumble: Now Betelgeuse... That makes me VERY moist
28/02/2020, 18:10 - David;: How big in the sky would a betelgeuse supernova appear?
28/02/2020, 18:24 - Damian Rumble: About the same size as the moon

28/02/2020, 21:55 - / James Ball: I've worked on a couple of other events there. I've strapped speakers and lights to those girders before now
29/02/2020, 09:01 - David;: You've managed to free hit in 1 player who has a blank fixture this week, 2 players unlikely to start and an injured player. Quite an achievement
29/02/2020, 09:01 - David;: What was the thinking behind Gilmour?
29/02/2020, 09:05 - Paul;: This week is a bit of a shit storm
29/02/2020, 10:11 - Damian Rumble: I picked up a couple of players who were dirt cheap and never going to start

29/02/2020, 10:20 - Rob;: My team looks mental. It saved my transfers but not team rearrangement. Won't matter as substitutions will sort it out, but I don't like looking mad

29/02/2020, 10:23 - Jack G;: I tried to be clever and captained Maddison

01/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Yeah, but isolating ourselves with the disease carriers in close quarters

01/03/2020, 17:34 - Jack G;: I’m half hoping I just get the virus tbh. Just a bit of flu and then I’m immune. Sit back and laugh at the panic
01/03/2020, 18:10 - / James Ball: I'm having wagonwheel-gate with Harriet currently. We're moving house and I bought some nostalgic wagonwheels (jammie variety) as a nice moving house snack. She'd never had them before. Instant hate from her "the chocolate is bland" "the biscuit tastes of nothing" "the jam is cheap".

01/03/2020, 18:14 - David;: What purpose do they serve?
01/03/2020, 18:14 - Jack G;: If you’re after jam, jammy dodger, if you’re after chocolate literally anything else. Wagon wheels are dogshit

02/03/2020, 14:29 - David;: That would be optimal, keep anniversaries down the frequency of world cups.

02/03/2020, 19:42 - Sam;: Have you watched the two part documentary on him? On itv.
02/03/2020, 19:44 - Sam;: Always feels like he’s talking shit but then he pulls a bit of logic out of bag. Plus he a heavyweight champion so he’s no chancer, or dosser as he would say
02/03/2020, 20:23 - Damian Rumble: Would be funny if a side effect of Coronavirus would be the complete collapse of the Corona beer company. No one wanting to buy a product associated with a global pandemic
02/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: There is a stat on that already you may have seen?
02/03/2020, 20:24 - Rob;: That, when asked, about 40% of Americans said they would never consider buying Corona again

03/03/2020, 13:31 - Jack G;: Twice the pain
03/03/2020, 13:32 - David;: The Nations League qualification dynamic is so complicated I've given up even bothering to understand it.
03/03/2020, 13:32 - Sam;: Yeah it’s due to their coefficient, they get two chances
03/03/2020, 13:33 - Damian Rumble: Germany France Portugal sounds very familiar...
03/03/2020, 13:33 - David;: If they win both do they have to play themsevles?
03/03/2020, 13:33 - Sam;: Yes
03/03/2020, 13:35 - David;: Think France have to be favourites
03/03/2020, 13:35 - David;: Then Germany, Spain, Netherlands us in with a shout. Italy ded.
03/03/2020, 13:36 - Jack G;: Wonder if coronavirus will impact anything. Like an extreme mode on football manager
03/03/2020, 13:37 - David;: They haven't even got a goalkeeper - I've heard he's Donnarummer
03/03/2020, 13:38 - Jack G;: Hebib
03/03/2020, 13:39 - David;: It's annoying at the beginning of the season I would have been confident but then Kane ded, Rashford ded, Abraham ded, Sterling in bad form, Pickford shit.
03/03/2020, 13:40 - Jack G;: Kane and Rashford due to be back by Euros though? Sterling will come good
03/03/2020, 13:40 - Jack G;: GK big issue though for sure
03/03/2020, 13:41 - David;: Yeah but there legs still being reattached. Won't have any form.
03/03/2020, 13:42 - David;: They will have only had a few games to get fit/sharp.
03/03/2020, 13:42 - David;: Hendo also currently ded
03/03/2020, 13:43 - Sam;: Dean Henderson for GK
03/03/2020, 13:45 - David;: Grealish has to start
03/03/2020, 13:45 - David;: The new Gazza
03/03/2020, 13:45 - David;: Our most creative midfielder
03/03/2020, 13:46 - Jack G;: Yeah Grealish has got to be in there
03/03/2020, 13:46 - David;: Front four of Sterling, Grealish, Sancho behind Kane. Decent
03/03/2020, 13:46 - David;: Hendo and Ox or Rice holding behind that
03/03/2020, 13:46 - Jack G;: Is Deli Alli just a write off now? Put shit in bin?
03/03/2020, 13:47 - David;: Nah decent. Just wouldn't start him over either of those 4
03/03/2020, 13:47 - David;: Don't rate him on the wing and then of our number 10s I'd choose Grealish over Maddison of Alli on current form
03/03/2020, 13:48 - David;: Back 4 Chilwell, Slabhead, Gomez, Trent
03/03/2020, 13:48 - David;: Pope in goal?
03/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: I vote Pope
03/03/2020, 13:51 - David;: Is loftus cheek ded?
03/03/2020, 13:53 - Jack G;: Hudson odoi too
03/03/2020, 13:54 - David;: Stones seems to be a piece of shit now
03/03/2020, 14:08 - Jack G;: Considering City okay Otamendi ahead of him I’d say so

03/03/2020, 20:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
03/03/2020, 20:42 - David;: Who could we get who's better but prepared to play as little as he does though?
03/03/2020, 20:43 - David;: (meant for the Liverpool thread)
03/03/2020, 20:45 - Sam;: Fretting over Adam Banana’s departure ay?
03/03/2020, 20:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Van dijk actually
03/03/2020, 20:50 - David;: In fact, Origi
03/03/2020, 20:59 - Sam;: Oh-rigi?
03/03/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Klopp's gone and lost 3 in 3 just to please that United fan who wrote to him
03/03/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Classic peado ruse
03/03/2020, 22:00 - Sam;: PEADOPOOL
03/03/2020, 22:26 - Damian Rumble: I think this only goes to prove that nothing can stand against the will of a small child
04/03/2020, 13:04 - Rob;: The amount of people stockpiling antibacterial alcohol gel to pretext themselves from a virus
04/03/2020, 13:04 - Rob;: Not going to work
04/03/2020, 13:29 - Sam;: I think it’s a cheap way to get pissed when we inevitably enter the apocalypse that corona will bring

04/03/2020, 18:21 - Jack G;: Got a flight booked with Flybe for later in the year...
04/03/2020, 18:28 - David;: Pull out while you still can
04/03/2020, 18:28 - David;: They're a shit show at the best of times.
04/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: One had a flight to Edinburgh landing at 9pm. They got me to Glasgow at 3am.
04/03/2020, 19:14 - Jack G;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-51744374
04/03/2020, 19:14 - Jack G;: No time to die
04/03/2020, 19:17 - Stefan;: My mate who works at Huffington Post said they came up with a lot of puns for this
04/03/2020, 19:18 - Stefan;: But they were all too poor taste to publisb
04/03/2020, 19:18 - Stefan;: publish
05/03/2020, 08:41 - / James Ball: Flybe dead. Need to book a new flight Jack
05/03/2020, 08:42 - Jack G;: Yeah. No one else does flights to Cornwall though... have filed a request with my credit card company for a refund

05/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Apparently the panic buying has mainly focussed on bog roll. How much are people shitting that that's the first concern?
05/03/2020, 19:00 - Rob;: Yeah I found that odd
05/03/2020, 19:01 - Rob;: I've never seen relentless shiting listed as symptom
05/03/2020, 19:05 - Damian Rumble: That's a no-deal brexit thing right?
05/03/2020, 20:20 - David;: <Media omitted>
05/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: Arancini balls. Such a great premise for a food.
05/03/2020, 20:22 - David;: So you've already cooked risotto, which is itself mainly carbs soaked in butter, cheese and stock. So you wrap that around mozzarella, slather it in egg, flour and bread and then deep fry the whole thing.
05/03/2020, 20:23 - David;: 2 types of cheese, 2 different fats and 3 carbs in one meal.
05/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: Yeah, with excellent textural contrast
05/03/2020, 20:24 - David;: It's like an upmarket vegetarian KFC.
05/03/2020, 20:26 - David;: <Media omitted>
05/03/2020, 20:50 - Damian Rumble: So it's like a scotch egg but for veggies? Not a big fan of scotch eggs tbh
05/03/2020, 21:20 - Rob;: Except that's there's no egg
05/03/2020, 21:35 - Rob;: And it's got a completely different texture and taste
05/03/2020, 21:35 - Rob;: And is more likely to be served very hot
05/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: And only one common ingredient
05/03/2020, 21:52 - David;: Yeah, the egg inside is a ball of cheese, the pork bit is risotto and it's hot. Similar look but different flavours

07/03/2020, 10:08 - Sam;: I don’t swear at my duvet anymore, I swear by it.
07/03/2020, 12:55 - Jack G;: Yes Salah you beauty
07/03/2020, 13:29 - Rob;: Every time I change my captain, Fantasy doesn't change it. No idea why. It's been Trent for weeks.
07/03/2020, 13:44 - Hamish Sinclair: Understandable, best right back in the world
07/03/2020, 13:47 - Rob;: It's not been a disaster, but I chose Mane this week
07/03/2020, 13:48 - Jack G;: Why not a city or arsenal player? Double game week for them
07/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: The only one I had was Debruyne, who's doubtful
07/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: Wary of next week too
07/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: And it wouldn't have mattered anyway, as i'd somehow have got Trent anyway
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Jack G;: No arsenal players? Surprising
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Hamish Sinclair: I've invested in arsenal
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Hamish Sinclair: Their on the up
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Jack G;: Martinelli the early season Origi
07/03/2020, 13:50 - Rob;: I just can't get burnt again
07/03/2020, 13:51 - Rob;: Loyalty burned me
07/03/2020, 13:51 - Rob;: Martinelli out of the team more recently
07/03/2020, 13:51 - Rob;: No arsenal game next week
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Jack G;: He’s playing much better than Lacazette though, should be starting
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Hamish Sinclair: Did I no want to hear this
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Sam;: Arsenal city on Wednesday bro
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Rob;: Part of this gameweek on Fantasy Football
07/03/2020, 13:52 - Rob;: Only 4 games next game week
07/03/2020, 13:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, should have done my research
07/03/2020, 14:01 - Sam;: Fuuuuuck
07/03/2020, 14:33 - Hamish Sinclair: This is wrong. They're playing brighton
07/03/2020, 14:38 - Damian Rumble: This really crept up on me
07/03/2020, 14:39 - Rob;: Ah yeah, week after next is the four-game week
07/03/2020, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: What is this?
07/03/2020, 14:40 - Damian Rumble: This wasn't in the calendar when I decided to use my free hit earlier
07/03/2020, 14:40 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 14:41 - Rob;: Because no one knew who would get to an FA cup quarter final
07/03/2020, 14:41 - Damian Rumble: Fuck that. That competition can fuck off.
07/03/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: Only football robots like you think that
07/03/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: The magic of the cup
07/03/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: Magic > data
07/03/2020, 15:29 - Jack G;: Arteta’s hairline is ridiculously good
07/03/2020, 15:41 - Rob;: The high press
07/03/2020, 16:36 - David;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: You done this Phil?
07/03/2020, 16:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Is phil a "sure footed fold with a  head for heights"
07/03/2020, 17:22 - David;: Rob why no Bellerin? Explain this.
07/03/2020, 17:22 - David;: I give them one chance. Let me down instantly.
07/03/2020, 17:23 - Jack G;: Bellerout
07/03/2020, 17:23 - Rob;: Not completely sure, beyond that he's been a bit broken this season and they might not have wanted to risk him
07/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: He's climbed the ridge he'll be fine
07/03/2020, 17:30 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 17:31 - David;: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: Small view
07/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: Unless there's a higher logic in play where they are anticipating the stodgy carb diet?
07/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: But that should bung things up if anything
07/03/2020, 17:34 - Jack G;: Time to invest stocks in bidets
07/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: People seem more concerned with having a shitty arse than starving to death
07/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: It's illogical - so many substitutes for bog roll if pushed. Newspapers. Grass.
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Sam;: Lol, grass. How? Are you weaving into a sheet or just bunch a fistful and hoping for structural integration?
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: Just showering after a shit
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: Better than grass
07/03/2020, 17:37 - Jack G;: We dint all have a sloppy, shitty disaster of an arsehole Sam. Grass is fine
07/03/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: If you get Corona virus, are you really going to be eating loads? Most people go off food when fevery
07/03/2020, 17:39 - Jack G;: The diarrhea though
07/03/2020, 17:40 - Rob;: Is that actually a symptom?
07/03/2020, 17:41 - Rob;: Not listed on NHS's page about it
07/03/2020, 17:41 - Jack G;: Pretty sure I’ve seen it listed as a symptom. Need confirmation from dr Sinclair
07/03/2020, 17:42 - David;: Grab a good bunch. Wipe arse.
07/03/2020, 17:42 - Rob;: Must have been such a good year for the loo roll folks
07/03/2020, 17:42 - Hamish Sinclair: No diarrhoea. But if you're self isolating for 14days and cant leave the house you're going to need a lot of bog roll and wank tissues
07/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: 14 days I think I would need 2 rolls max
07/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: How much are you shitting?
07/03/2020, 17:43 - Jack G;: Just consume a lots of fibre
07/03/2020, 17:43 - Jack G;: Minimal shifting
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Rob;: That would make you shit more, Jack
07/03/2020, 17:45 - David;: Yeah. Last thing you need is a lentil dahl
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Jack G;: I thought it just made your shit more solid?
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Rob;: No, the opposite
07/03/2020, 17:45 - Jack G;: Or have I succumbed to fake news
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: It's just any food you can't digest. Increases the bulk of your shit, and the throughput
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Jack G;: Ah
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Jack G;: So bran flakes are out
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: Lol, yes
07/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: Haha
07/03/2020, 17:47 - Rob;: 'I seem to be shotting more. I must need more dried apricots and beans'
07/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Ah that whole last bit of the thread has killed me
07/03/2020, 17:56 - Rob;: I'm glad we cleared this up before you self isolated Jack
07/03/2020, 17:57 - Rob;: You might have accidentally given yourself diarrhea by trying to prevent yourself from getting diarrhea that wasn't actually on its way anyway
07/03/2020, 18:00 - David;: Hamish has interesting data on apricots
07/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: Volume
07/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: Colour
07/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: All affected by apricot
07/03/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: That's what the Foo Fighters' 1997 album The Colour and the Shape is about
07/03/2020, 19:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Apricots essentially create unlimited gas
07/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: I made an entire floor of my house a no go zone
07/03/2020, 20:54 - Phill: Haven't done it. Will do it next year
07/03/2020, 21:26 - Phill: Also it's in the Black Cuillins. Which is a big NO in winter with two small dogs
07/03/2020, 21:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 21:27 - Phill: That's those things. DAT snow. DAT ice. DAT wind.
07/03/2020, 21:27 - Phill: It's got mountain rescue written all over it.
07/03/2020, 21:46 - David;: You'd be fine. I back you
07/03/2020, 21:46 - David;: Just take a coat
07/03/2020, 21:47 - David;: Good pair of socks
07/03/2020, 21:52 - Phill: Some Indians walking up Storr in flip flops on Thursday
07/03/2020, 21:52 - Phill: 6 inches of snow
07/03/2020, 21:52 - Phill: -3
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Sam;: Lol, you witnessed that Phil?
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Phill: Yeah
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Phill: 2 Indian blokes
07/03/2020, 21:55 - Phill: Just trotting up the mountain path
07/03/2020, 21:56 - Phill: Not concerned
07/03/2020, 21:56 - Sam;: Is the path covered in 6 inches?
07/03/2020, 21:58 - Phill: <Media omitted>
07/03/2020, 22:05 - Sam;: Lol. Flip flops on that.
07/03/2020, 22:09 - Phill: Hamish how is it on the front line of Covid-19?
07/03/2020, 22:09 - Damian Rumble: That's pretty lord of the rings
07/03/2020, 22:09 - Damian Rumble: "they're taking the hobbits to isengard"
07/03/2020, 22:10 - Phill: I've been out of the loop for a week and now can't seem to buy bog roll or soap
07/03/2020, 22:10 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm gagging for a period of self isolation
07/03/2020, 22:11 - Phill: Are you pretty much resigned to getting the virus?
07/03/2020, 22:13 - Phill: It is ebin.
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: Lol match of the day
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: No handshakes
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: Immediately followed by players grappling with each other and handling each other for set pieces
07/03/2020, 22:35 - Phill: So pointless
07/03/2020, 23:23 - Rob;: Liked this paragraph in an article about life in Wuhan

07/03/2020, 23:26 - Rob;: (such a good joke)
08/03/2020, 09:01 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 09:11 - Rob;: Lol. Trying to nudge theory the most powerful man in the world out of ice cream
08/03/2020, 09:12 - Phill: Also hate this idea that adding a healthy food to an unhealthy food somehow makes it less fattening
08/03/2020, 09:13 - Rob;: Yeah, it's not the potato in mashed potato that makes it unhealthy
08/03/2020, 09:13 - Rob;: It's the milk, butter and salt
08/03/2020, 09:13 - Phill: Becca says it all the time with salad. Asks if I want salad with dinner. I say no. She says it's good for you. Doesn't understand that by not eating the salad I am consuming less calories
08/03/2020, 09:14 - Rob;: Good fibre in salad though Phil
08/03/2020, 09:14 - Phill: But what if I'm eating a bean chilli and brown rice.
08/03/2020, 09:14 - Rob;: Well yeah, more fibre in that
08/03/2020, 09:15 - Phill: Must I also consume an extra 200cals in leaf and oil?
08/03/2020, 09:15 - Rob;: Obviously not
08/03/2020, 09:16 - Rob;: But in a different meal, replacing say 6 chips with a handful of salad leaves would beneficial
08/03/2020, 09:16 - Phill: In theory.
08/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: The salad has to itself not be oily/calorific etc and be eatin instead of something worse
08/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: But more variation is always a plus
08/03/2020, 09:17 - Phill: But in practice it never is. It's always an extra.
08/03/2020, 09:18 - Phill: I'm still going to eat the same amount of burger regardless of if I have a token salad on the side.
08/03/2020, 09:18 - Rob;: Yeah, you'd have to swap some chips
08/03/2020, 09:18 - Phill: Not going to happen. Fake news.
08/03/2020, 09:19 - Rob;: But only eating burger and never ever having any vegetables because they would be _more calories_ would just leave your enzymes craving vitamins
08/03/2020, 09:20 - Rob;: For the small reward of having cut the least calorific element of the meal
08/03/2020, 09:20 - Phill: Just take a multivitamin. Next.
08/03/2020, 09:20 - Rob;: Fine. But I would enjoy eating a salad more than popping a pill
08/03/2020, 09:22 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 09:22 - Rob;: 5 stars... Reasonably neutral taste. Would neutrally taste again.
08/03/2020, 17:57 - David;: It's not certain your body absorbs multivitamin tablets in the same way as vitamins from fruit and veg
08/03/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: I am very much twitching my ass on the bench here
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Hows that arsr?
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Sam;: Very happy arse now.
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Sam;: Thank you Ederson
08/03/2020, 18:25 - Hamish Sinclair: What a happy arse
08/03/2020, 19:20 - David;: Just had a very Scottish dining experience. In a fish and chip bar, the fish and chips come with a mandatory free side of bread and butter.
08/03/2020, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Battered?
08/03/2020, 19:21 - Rob;: They do that up north too
08/03/2020, 19:21 - David;: So unecessary. You're ordering a meal of carbs and fat. I assume you'll need a side of carbs and fat to go with that.
08/03/2020, 19:22 - Rob;: Or down south, from a Scottish perspective
08/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Yeah. I'd like to map the bread frontier
08/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Imagine it goes somewhere along the midlands
08/03/2020, 19:22 - Rob;: Grimsby is the furthest south I've experienced it
08/03/2020, 19:23 - Rob;: Different, but in Leamington if you ordered a chip batch, assuming that mean a big batch of chips, you actually got a chip butty with your meal.
08/03/2020, 19:24 - David;: That was actually the main legacy of Roman occupation I've heard. The Scottish tribes continued to serve bread with their chips as a sign of freedom and resistance
08/03/2020, 19:24 - David;: With the chips as well though? Like it's an extra not a substitute
08/03/2020, 19:25 - Damian Rumble: That sounds like bollocks to me
08/03/2020, 19:25 - David;: Well yes it was a joke
08/03/2020, 19:25 - Rob;: Lol
08/03/2020, 19:26 - Rob;: Nah, disappointing sub. You got extra bread roll and fewer chips, when to a non-midlander it sounds like more chips
08/03/2020, 19:27 - David;: Yeah I would want it as a side with my chips
08/03/2020, 19:27 - Rob;: Would be good if this is how you processed all jokes. Goes to comedy show. Everyone else laughs while you call bullshit on every story
08/03/2020, 19:29 - Rob;: A thing I've really come to learn about fish and chips as I've got older is that it's all about the sauces. I want curry sauce, mushy peas and ketchup
08/03/2020, 19:29 - Rob;: There's a lot of stodge and increasingly cold fat to cut through
08/03/2020, 19:29 - Rob;: So much more vinegar needed than they think you need
08/03/2020, 19:30 - David;: Yeah you can't trust them with vinegar and salt levels they need manual adjustment
08/03/2020, 19:30 - David;: Pints of vinegar Rob
08/03/2020, 19:30 - Rob;: I could dip chips into a pint of it
08/03/2020, 19:30 - Rob;: A good serving suggestion
08/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: The type of vinegar also crucial
08/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: Need to be that darker chip shop vinegar not generic malt
08/03/2020, 19:31 - Rob;: Yeah. Has to be 100% opaque
08/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: Or, at the other end of this chip spectrum that really cheap spray on vinegar that is like battery acid. Actually works well
08/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: For the sort of chips that come in styrofoam
08/03/2020, 19:33 - David;: Chippy lido style
08/03/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: Chippy lido is a pretty high calibre local day out
08/03/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: Obviously shit
08/03/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: But on a hot day, the combo of refreshing pool, relaxing field and grotty shop is amazing
08/03/2020, 19:38 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/03/2020, 19:39 - Phill: People honking in wow
08/03/2020, 19:42 - David;: The new steam room they've put in is great. But always seems to be closed/broken
08/03/2020, 22:13 - Rob;: And that's Crufts

https://twitter.com/TaliaShadwell/status/1236759105353777158?s=19
08/03/2020, 22:13 - David;: Shangri la at Glasto will have a good time with coronavirus surely
08/03/2020, 22:13 - David;: It basically is a real life Shangri la theme
09/03/2020, 13:57 - Jack G;: How can the government claim that we’re still in a containment phase with coronavirus while simultaneously accepting it will spread in a significant way. Negligent
09/03/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: Told you we’d be fucked
09/03/2020, 14:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Hope everyones got their bogroll
09/03/2020, 14:07 - Jack G;: I’d invest in stocks in Andrex but looks like share prices have fallen so much that trading has been suspended
09/03/2020, 14:07 - Paul;: Can’t shit if your dead jack
09/03/2020, 14:08 - Rob;: Two weeks ago Italy had fewer cases than we do now and followed the same containment procedures as we are now
09/03/2020, 14:09 - Rob;: Can't wait to get quarantined
09/03/2020, 14:10 - Rob;: My work has two major clients: British Airways and Tesco
09/03/2020, 14:10 - Paul;: Is the Coronavirus more deadly than they first thought?
09/03/2020, 14:11 - Rob;: One getting absolutely fucked, one feasibly doing very well in the short term out of it. Hard to know how it'll go
09/03/2020, 14:12 - Jack G;: I think it’s still quite uncertain. A lot of unreported cases where people were fine skewing it. Still not ideal though and apparently reinfection is a thing
09/03/2020, 14:17 - Jack G;: Imagine if this happened with something deadlier than coronavirus, would be complete chaos
09/03/2020, 14:30 - Rob;: It probably wouldn't move as quickly - really deadly things are obvious and get contained quickly. They also limit their own transmission by killing their hosts before they spread it too far
09/03/2020, 14:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Apparently they have considered just getting it over and done with and letting it spread thought wh population quickly
09/03/2020, 14:31 - Hamish Sinclair: But think they predicted 500k deatha
09/03/2020, 14:31 - Hamish Sinclair: The current plans are based on trying to contain it until summer
09/03/2020, 14:31 - Rob;: This one is quite exceptional in being symptomless while infectious, possible to mistake for other diseases, and very survivable. Good properties for wide spreading
09/03/2020, 14:39 - Stefan;: Yeah the issue with letting it spread quickly is you get a massive peak of cases which overwhelms the health system
09/03/2020, 14:39 - Stefan;: Which exponentially increases deaths directly from coronavirus, and indirectly from other illnesses which people can't get treated for
09/03/2020, 14:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Not enough intensive care beds
09/03/2020, 14:40 - Jack G;: Also there have been quite a few cases of reinfection so it’s not even getting the problem out of the way
09/03/2020, 14:41 - Rob;: Is reinfection confirmed as a secondary infection? Or people becoming ill again after a latency period? I had only heard of the latter, and it was suggested people weren't contagious at that point
09/03/2020, 14:41 - Jack G;: Not sure tbh, but worrying nonetheless
09/03/2020, 15:24 - Damian Rumble: Yeah but most of those are baby boomers
09/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: Yes, excellent, our parents
09/03/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: The oldest boomer is actually 74, so I guess it will actually kill more of whatever the generation above them is called
09/03/2020, 15:42 - Stefan;: In the US they're called the Silent Generation
09/03/2020, 15:45 - Rob;: No wonder I hadn't heard of them
09/03/2020, 23:36 - Rob;: Dark Waters is big
09/03/2020, 23:37 - Rob;: Dupont are very naughty boys
09/03/2020, 23:46 - David;: hib
09/03/2020, 23:49 - Damian Rumble: Cracking weekend in FPL. Points everywhere. Just making up for the inevitable crushing FA cup weekend though

10/03/2020, 12:10 - Jack G;: Envelope
10/03/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: Should get our U.K. quarantine soon
10/03/2020, 12:27 - Sam;: Boom
10/03/2020, 12:27 - Sam;: last one.. what starts with. a T ends in a T and has tea in it.
10/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: A tit cus it has a baby's tea in it
10/03/2020, 12:29 - Sam;: correct
10/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: Quarantine when
10/03/2020, 18:45 - David;: Well, she was covid-19,
You know what I mean
And the way she spread
Was way beyond control
10/03/2020, 18:49 - David;: Covideo Killed the Radio Star
10/03/2020, 18:53 - David;: Covid-19 Killed the Radio Star

10/03/2020, 23:28 - Damian Rumble: Would be great if she inadvertently spread Coronavirus through the conservation party, whiping out all their old, racist mps
11/03/2020, 07:29 - Rob;: What is it with football club owners being coronavirus forerunners
11/03/2020, 07:31 - Rob;: Olympiakos, Nottingham Forest
11/03/2020, 07:31 - Rob;: Is it just that rich people get themselves tested?
11/03/2020, 07:49 - Damian Rumble: @447526575752 how do you feel about the arsenal man city game being postponed?
11/03/2020, 07:58 - Hamish Sinclair: It's true that the impending pandemic has scuppered my fantasy football efforts. This is the first time I've ever used the free hit chip, would not return again
11/03/2020, 08:01 - Damian Rumble: Luckily Phil had a decidedly average week so it's not the end of the world
11/03/2020, 08:02 - Rob;: Several Arsenal players have now been asked to self isolate
11/03/2020, 08:02 - Rob;: Fantasy football might be fucked, lads
11/03/2020, 08:02 - Rob;: You think Ozil could survive a brush with anything?
11/03/2020, 08:03 - Jack G;: What about the actual premier league too. Could end up getting cancelled similar to serie a. No title given out
11/03/2020, 08:03 - Sam;: Lol. He owns both clubs you nugget
11/03/2020, 08:17 - Damian Rumble: Nah just do it the same as the six Nations. Just make arsenal  play all thier matches in the summer/autumn
11/03/2020, 08:21 - Rob;: Ah. There we go
11/03/2020, 08:21 - Rob;: Not sure I approve of that
11/03/2020, 08:22 - Sam;: >autumn. Fuck up next season as well.
11/03/2020, 08:23 - Rob;: Perhaps it will be called off and Liverpool won't ever technically be champions
11/03/2020, 08:25 - David;: Ozil is gone. Even if he hasn't got it the panic will overwhelm his immune systems
11/03/2020, 08:26 - Jack G;: Liverpool need 2 more wins for the title? In a race against COVID-19
11/03/2020, 08:28 - David;: Which arsenal players though? That's key FF information
11/03/2020, 08:43 - Rob;: Apparently since they met him almost two weeks ago at the match, their isolation period is almost over
11/03/2020, 08:44 - Rob;: Back in group training on Friday
11/03/2020, 08:45 - Rob;: I was also at that match. Currently fine
11/03/2020, 08:46 - Rob;: I'm hoping for someone at work to get it very mildly just after I've moved house next week, then I can spend my self isolation painting and decorating
11/03/2020, 08:46 - Rob;: Stockpiling sandpaper not toilet paper

11/03/2020, 09:52 - Phill: Are you buying with Julia or solo ?
11/03/2020, 09:53 - Rob;: But perhaps lesser cunts in a sea of cunts
11/03/2020, 09:53 - Rob;: Together. Big plunge, but we've watch a lot of homes under the hammer together so we're prepared
11/03/2020, 09:54 - Rob;: Yeah, for London on a first time buyer budget it's big. The downside is it's on a fairly busy road, but it's a long house, so we can shift most of the living space to the back
11/03/2020, 09:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Garden looks big
11/03/2020, 09:59 - Hamish Sinclair: Need a BBq
11/03/2020, 10:00 - Rob;: I have two
11/03/2020, 10:00 - Rob;: But I might build a proper one
11/03/2020, 10:00 - Hamish Sinclair: One each.

11/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Which is pretty brutal
11/03/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: When will they quarantine?
11/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Why does Italy have such a higher death rate than elsewhere. Purely demographics?
11/03/2020, 18:49 - Hamish Sinclair: It's not so much the mortality it's the surge of cases
11/03/2020, 18:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Has overwhelmed their hospitals
11/03/2020, 18:51 - David;: But also 800 dead from 12,000. Almost 7%
11/03/2020, 18:52 - David;: Unless they are very shit at testing
11/03/2020, 18:53 - David;: So it skews results. We are 6 dead from 450. Much lower as a % of cases
11/03/2020, 18:53 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 18:54 - David;: So they are testing. Just high case rate and deaths.
11/03/2020, 18:55 - Stefan;: https://www.livescience.com/why-italy-coronavirus-deaths-so-high.html
3 reasons: older population, health service overwhelmed in local areas, and mild cases going undetected
11/03/2020, 18:55 - David;: Old population plus social dynamics I guess
11/03/2020, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah this
11/03/2020, 18:55 - David;: But why mild cases undetected if they're 2nd highest test rate globally?
11/03/2020, 18:55 - Hamish Sinclair: The milder cases undetected is pretty key
11/03/2020, 18:56 - Stefan;: Interesting that death rate per case was 5.8% in Wuhan but only 0.7% in rest of China, which they attribute to the local health system being overwhelmed by volume of cases
11/03/2020, 18:58 - Stefan;: Probably because the real number of infections per head is so much higher than other countries with high testing rates. So more are missed
11/03/2020, 18:59 - Rob;: I would imagine once it's spread to all areas and you have sustained community transmission, testing becomes a much lower priority
11/03/2020, 18:59 - Rob;: Probably get lots of people who have it just staying in and not engaging with health care at all
11/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: So really does point to acting soon and smoothing peak out. Can't let it get away from you
11/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, the mortality is actually highly dependent on resources, mainly Intensive care beds
11/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Meant to reply to this...
11/03/2020, 19:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Also the demand on these resources from other illnesses will not just go away during the next month, so the hidden mortality underlying this may be the people who died from other illness but couldn't get care because of civid19
11/03/2020, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm buying bogroll as we speak
11/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: 10 times more lethal than seasonal flu they’re saying
11/03/2020, 19:27 - Paul;: How empty are shelves looking?
11/03/2020, 19:29 - David;: I guess we're lucky that at least it seems to be evenly spreading across the UK less intense demand on any given region. Italy got fucked in tensely in one small area at first
11/03/2020, 19:29 - David;: Hand sanitizer gone from  my supermarket.
11/03/2020, 19:30 - Rob;: Bog roll entirely gone in my local Aldi
11/03/2020, 19:30 - Paul;: My no deal brexit stock pile still holding strong
11/03/2020, 19:30 - David;: They had the UK bog roll boss out today saying it's all fine just don't be idiots
11/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: They've got massive extra capacity. Not a problem making more bog roll
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: How much more are people planning on shitting
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Rob;: They made the big roll for us. We'll be fine
11/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: Shit twice as fast and furiously in a crisis
11/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: Yeah - just buy that roll. More than a lifetimes shitting in that I'd imagine
11/03/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: You'd be annoyed if you got it installed on your giant holder the wrong way
11/03/2020, 19:33 - Stefan;: I love that this bog roll thing is clearly because of the no-deal Brexit threat last year, where it was one of the imported goods most at risk of shortages
11/03/2020, 19:33 - Stefan;: Because of customs checks
11/03/2020, 19:34 - Stefan;: And a viral epidemic has fuck all to with that
11/03/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: It's people anticipating being made to stay at home for two weeks though isn't it
11/03/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: Not being allowed to go out and buy big roll when they need a huge shit
11/03/2020, 19:34 - David;: 2 fucking weeks I don't even get through a whole roll in that
11/03/2020, 19:35 - David;: I always have a few rolls in anyway. The issue is these fly by the seat of your pants cunts going down to the wire with every roll
11/03/2020, 19:35 - David;: Then panicking
11/03/2020, 19:35 - David;: Feast to famine
11/03/2020, 19:37 - Stefan;: Yeah but there's definitely also an element of "looming crisis = bog roll shortages" in people's minds
11/03/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: There basically is just as much big roll as ever, and people are shitting at the same rate, it's just been unevenly distributed into the most panicky people's homes
11/03/2020, 19:40 - David;: Yep
11/03/2020, 19:41 - David;: Enforcing planing buying onto others. It's a prisoners dillema game in essence
11/03/2020, 19:41 - David;: The most rational outcome collectively doesn't correspond to the most rational outcome individually if there isn't co-ordination or information sharing
11/03/2020, 19:42 - Paul;: Shit big, shit quickly and shit fast
11/03/2020, 19:43 - Paul;: Quickly and fast a fundamental difference but of critical importance in the art of the shart
11/03/2020, 19:43 - David;: You can't shit at a sustained higher rate without eating more.v
11/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Don't do a Jack and give yourself diarrhea
11/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Eat less
11/03/2020, 19:44 - David;: Eat intensely spicy food exclusively
11/03/2020, 19:45 - Rob;: Just get yourself on an IV drip. No shit
11/03/2020, 20:24 - Damian Rumble: I am loving the thought of what Charlie booker would make of all this in "News Wipe" if he was still making that
11/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: The deliveroo advert with Slabhead et al is so shit
11/03/2020, 20:49 - David;: Gets worse every time I see it
11/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 20:56 - David;: I've only gone and bought this. Feels good to have.
11/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: A classic football. Place it in the same category of the late 90s mitre balls.
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Is that this seasons?
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: I’m not avin that orange spot.
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Poor design
11/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: Yeah this seasons prem ball
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Will bring back bad memories
11/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: I love the stripe. Best bit about it
11/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: That's why younintantly dislike it
11/03/2020, 20:59 - David;: Really clarifies the curl that has been put on a strike
11/03/2020, 20:59 - David;: Hence why they named it the Nike strike I assume
11/03/2020, 20:59 - David;: Rhymes as well
11/03/2020, 21:00 - David;: They've just pulled a blinder. Inset grooves to improve grip.
11/03/2020, 21:01 - David;: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 21:01 - Sam;: This is first season where they’re introduced a new design mid season. That’s what I’m most annoyed about. The yellow was also crap this year
11/03/2020, 21:02 - David;: Watch a goal where the ball stays ball. This ball is great for that
11/03/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Ball stays ball
11/03/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Go dog go
11/03/2020, 21:04 - David;: Would love a heads and volleys on the common to put it through its paces
11/03/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: Ball stays ball
11/03/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: Brown Vs Brown
11/03/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: Gnome represents gnome
11/03/2020, 21:33 - David;: Famous football weekly phrase
11/03/2020, 21:33 - David;: Embarassing not to pick up on that
11/03/2020, 21:58 - Damian Rumble: Tasty bit of extra time
11/03/2020, 22:05 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
11/03/2020, 22:06 - Paul;: Best to just get rid? Let it go
11/03/2020, 22:08 - / James Ball: Actually grasping and letting go of things is particularly hard with my thumb in its current state
12/03/2020, 09:09 - Sam;: So the cobras are meeting today and announces we has delay phase?
12/03/2020, 09:10 - Rob;: If they don't do it now we've completely fucked it
12/03/2020, 09:10 - Jack G;: Nice little 2-3 weeks working from home then?
12/03/2020, 09:48 - Jack G;: I’ve actually just been told to work from home from tomorrow on until COVID-19 has blown over
12/03/2020, 09:48 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm hoping for the same
12/03/2020, 09:49 - Jack G;: I think it will be government advice later to encourage it
12/03/2020, 09:51 - Rob;: We seem to be preparing for that.
12/03/2020, 09:53 - Rob;: Quite likely I wouldn't be able to unless they get me and about 20 other people quite a good MacBook. Could get some nice downtime out of it
12/03/2020, 10:10 - / James Ball: I'm not going to be able to work from home. I'm having jobs cancel now. Starting to look at a roughly £2k loss of earnings over the next 3 weeks
12/03/2020, 10:10 - / James Ball: Rischi Rich's self employment help is too little too late
12/03/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 12:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Dat kebab
12/03/2020, 12:49 - Phill: Lol was kekking about this earlier
12/03/2020, 12:49 - Rob;: The perfect last line
12/03/2020, 13:04 - David;: Come on. PSA conference cancelled because of dat corona. Whole paper I don't have to write or present now.
12/03/2020, 13:05 - David;: The amount of switch time this makes room for 👏🏻
12/03/2020, 13:05 - Jack G;: Skyrim time?
12/03/2020, 13:05 - David;: Yeah yeah
12/03/2020, 13:05 - David;: Well probably stardew valley these days.
12/03/2020, 13:07 - David;: Or I could do some unfinished stuff on breath of the wild. Maybe solve the deku tree riddles.
12/03/2020, 13:09 - David;: This is just excellent. Best pandemic ever
12/03/2020, 15:02 - David;: Tom Hanks has coronavirus
12/03/2020, 15:02 - Jack G;: Old news
12/03/2020, 15:42 - Paul;: Trump Coronavirus incoming
12/03/2020, 15:45 - Rob;: 140 new cases today, up from 80 yesterday. Figures probably a week behind actual exposure. Those numbers are going to shoot up aren't they?
12/03/2020, 15:47 - Jack G;: Certainly. Looks like football will be cancelled pretty soon too. 3 Leicester players are currently being tested
12/03/2020, 15:58 - Damian Rumble: The cancelled the Australian GP as well. Madness to let that go ahead this week
12/03/2020, 15:59 - Phill: They should cancel GP permanently.
12/03/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: Lol
12/03/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: Catastrophic rim failure
12/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Euros off
12/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Stay.
12/03/2020, 16:47 - David;: Champs league as well likely
12/03/2020, 16:47 - David;: Put away the moon
12/03/2020, 16:48 - Jack G;: Liverpool just ahead of the trend purposely getting knocked out of the tourney
12/03/2020, 16:49 - David;: Just need to lock the prem down before it can be cancelled
12/03/2020, 16:50 - David;: Could stop Phil winning his first Jules Chippet title. Obviously couldn't possibly awarded without completing the season.
12/03/2020, 16:51 - Rob;: I suppose it can never be won before the final whistle on the final day as there's no points limit
12/03/2020, 16:52 - Rob;: Every player could get two hattricks
12/03/2020, 16:52 - Jack G;: Will be interesting to see what happens with relegation and euro qualification if the prem is cancelled.
12/03/2020, 16:53 - Rob;: Would be gutting for Leeds. Would kill my mate
12/03/2020, 16:56 - David;: Should apply the league positions at time of suspension
12/03/2020, 16:56 - David;: Should have won more games earlier in the season if relegated. Sorry.
12/03/2020, 16:56 - Jack G;: Lol
12/03/2020, 16:56 - Jack G;: Brutal
12/03/2020, 16:58 - Jack G;: Maybe some sort of playoff scenario in the summer?
12/03/2020, 17:07 - Paul;: At least 5-10k cases in U.K.
12/03/2020, 17:07 - Paul;: At bottom of sharp upward curve
12/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: Predicting 80% of population to be infected
12/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: <1% fatality rate
12/03/2020, 17:27 - Paul;: 500k deaths
12/03/2020, 17:27 - Paul;: *upper case estimate
12/03/2020, 17:29 - Jack G;: We’re fine
12/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: Won't happen. Only 3k dead in China
12/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: Much bigger population, hit earlier, less well prepared, less good healthcare system.
12/03/2020, 17:30 - Jack G;: Chances are I’ve already had it
12/03/2020, 17:30 - Damian Rumble: Probably China are censoring the true figures though right
12/03/2020, 17:30 - Damian Rumble: Also China have a much more powerful state to shut down and quarantine society
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Jack G;: They were also trying to cover it up for 3 weeks and sacrificed one region for the rest of the country essentially
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Paul;: Built hospitals in 10 days
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Damian Rumble: USA fucked. Private healthcare plus shit employment laws. The survivors will be bankrupt
12/03/2020, 17:31 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah USA is fucked we can all agree there
12/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: USA too stupid to contain it
12/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: Will be doing all the wrong things constantly
12/03/2020, 17:33 - Jack G;: It’s more that people are used to avoiding medical assistant to avoid bankruptcy
12/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: We’re not containing it. Just staying away from old people
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Rob;: Yeah we're doing shit
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Paul;: Said we need some immunity in the population
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Rob;: But we'll do something once it gets quite bad
12/03/2020, 17:34 - Paul;: Just trying to push back the peak
12/03/2020, 17:35 - Rob;: That does make sense. When there's no cure or inoculation available, letting people get it slowly is your best option. We're just not really doing that very well
12/03/2020, 17:35 - Paul;: “Controlled transmission”
12/03/2020, 17:36 - Jack G;: Yeah tbh there are only 3 ways to stop a virus. 1) Mass vaccination (not feasible for probably over a year) 2) Hurd immunity 3) everyone dies
12/03/2020, 17:36 - Jack G;: What’s the best option? Obviously 2
12/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: So you're confident you've already got it?
12/03/2020, 17:45 - Jack G;: Well I definitely had mild cold type symptoms for the last 2-3 days. So it’s 50/50 I guess whether it’s a standard cold or corona?
12/03/2020, 17:46 - Paul;: Yeah same here since returning from USA. But just feels like standard cold
12/03/2020, 17:46 - David;: Same
12/03/2020, 17:46 - Paul;: Anticipating standard cold
12/03/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: Ah
12/03/2020, 17:46 - David;: Very mild cold
12/03/2020, 17:47 - David;: I don't think I have corona
12/03/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: But jack definitely does
12/03/2020, 17:47 - David;: If it is then it's shit, I want my money back
12/03/2020, 17:47 - Jack G;: Exponential growth in the thread
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Yeah Just an annoying cold
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Can’t be it
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Surely not
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: But suspiciously timed
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Damian Rumble: I had a pretty bad fever after coming back from Norway. And I did sit next a Chinese girl in a bus for 8 hours while I was there
12/03/2020, 17:48 - David;: Everyone is going to get psychosomatic illnesses from self-trolling
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Damian Rumble: Patient zero
12/03/2020, 17:48 - David;: Well you're fucked
12/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Damo definitely had it
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: But I'm fine now
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Coronavirus 101 is fever
12/03/2020, 17:49 - David;: It gets hard to know whether you're ill or not
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Plus Chinese
12/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: And only my two of my housemates and thier boyfriends caught it
12/03/2020, 17:50 - Stefan;: I've got the absolute classic cold symptoms - blocked nose and sore throat, feeling generally shit
12/03/2020, 17:50 - Stefan;: But no cough or fever
12/03/2020, 17:50 - Jack G;: The reverse placebo
12/03/2020, 17:51 - David;: So everyone already has corona
12/03/2020, 17:51 - Stefan;: So I'm good to go anywhere
12/03/2020, 17:51 - Paul;: Got this but doesn’t fit the fever, cough or shortness of breath
12/03/2020, 17:51 - David;: Same. No fever.
12/03/2020, 17:51 - David;: I do have a somewhat dry throat
12/03/2020, 17:52 - Jack G;: Yeah I also skipped fever but have everything else
12/03/2020, 17:52 - Paul;: Lol
12/03/2020, 17:52 - David;: You can't skip the fever
12/03/2020, 17:52 - David;: Fever is the main symptom
12/03/2020, 17:52 - David;: I think I don't have coronavirus.
12/03/2020, 17:52 - Paul;: Odds are you do
12/03/2020, 17:53 - David;: Nah
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Jack G;: I did wake up with a cold sweat though the other night
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: Hah
12/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: The fever
12/03/2020, 17:53 - David;: If there are 10,000. 1 in 600 people. Fancy my odds.
12/03/2020, 17:54 - David;: Ah here we go. Kept that rather quiet Jack.
12/03/2020, 17:55 - Jack G;: Well I wouldn’t class it as a fever. No shivering or raised temperature for more than a night
12/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Just a standard night waking up bolt upright in a cold sweat.
12/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Screaming
12/03/2020, 17:56 - Jack G;: But have you heard of a one night fever? Surely you can’t recover than quickly. Must have been in the mind
12/03/2020, 18:13 - Paul;: Jack you got ravaged by the virus
12/03/2020, 18:14 - Sam;: I’m tip top. Drawing strength from the panic.
12/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: Chaos is a ladder
12/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: You were born in the darkness. Moulded by it.
12/03/2020, 18:45 - Jack G;: You didn’t see coronavirus until you were already immune
12/03/2020, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: SEAGULLFORWARD
12/03/2020, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 19:17 - / James Ball: I also have recent cold like symptoms
12/03/2020, 19:18 - / James Ball: Slight cough, stuffy nose. No fever, generally feel fine
12/03/2020, 19:19 - Rob;: I've heard Corona doesn't do snot. Hamish is that true?
12/03/2020, 19:24 - Paul;: I’ve had snot
12/03/2020, 19:24 - Paul;: But odd all to have hit a cold at the same time. Haven’t had a cold or anything in 3 years or so
12/03/2020, 19:25 - Phill: Yeah I've felt grotty. No snot. Slight cough.
12/03/2020, 19:25 - Phill: Plus my arse is in bits so the toilet paper has come in handy
12/03/2020, 19:26 - / James Ball: Most likely corvid candidate so far
12/03/2020, 19:29 - Phill: No explanation for the arse
12/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: Arse not a typical symptom?
12/03/2020, 19:51 - Phill: Don't think so

12/03/2020, 20:03 - Stefan;: Great chat on radio 6 just now from Mark Riley:
"We are all mindful of the fact that we're hearing on the news and we're just living in this world where there are coronaviruses. And it's a horrible and scary time, particularly for bands who are on the knife edge of making it work and making it pay."

Guest: "Um, well yeah, it's even more scary for people with respiratory problems"
12/03/2020, 20:21 - Paul;: Herd immunity is GOAT
12/03/2020, 21:25 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
12/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Thoughts on the glasto line up for you going?
12/03/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: None of us have tickets
12/03/2020, 21:27 - Jack G;: Watched this too many times already!

12/03/2020, 22:14 - Damian Rumble: Just got a text from my boss. Apparently the CEO of BT has been tested positive for Coronavirus. No doubt shit will be hitting the fan tomorrow
12/03/2020, 22:50 - David;: Arteta
12/03/2020, 22:50 - David;: Corona
12/03/2020, 23:06 - Paul;: Maybe we have got it then. Seemingly everyone who feels a bit ill has it
12/03/2020, 23:06 - Paul;: Next
12/03/2020, 23:07 - David;: Nah this is fuck all
12/03/2020, 23:07 - David;: Just a sniffle
12/03/2020, 23:07 - David;: Everyone has made themselves ill psychologically
12/03/2020, 23:08 - Paul;: There is no virus
12/03/2020, 23:08 - David;: Yeah self-reinforcing cycle until everyone kills each other
12/03/2020, 23:09 - Paul;: Until everyone shits themselves to death through repeated hoarding of bog roll
12/03/2020, 23:12 - David;: Sell Arsenal players.
12/03/2020, 23:13 - David;: No chance that game will be played

12/03/2020, 23:36 - David;: Steve Barclay MP is very Derek

13/03/2020, 07:43 - Paul;: Never sneezing. They’re sure on that
13/03/2020, 07:46 - Rob;: Where does that asterisk go?
13/03/2020, 07:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Every cloud...

https://apple.news/AaSWp4D2zQiSPsPMr9k41vw
13/03/2020, 07:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Bog roll explained
13/03/2020, 07:56 - Damian Rumble: Lol
13/03/2020, 07:58 - Damian Rumble: Can someone explain how the premier League can continue? Four clubs and multiple players infected
13/03/2020, 07:58 - Jack G;: It won’t, they’re having an emergency meeting today
13/03/2020, 08:02 - Paul;: Liverpool unable to win
13/03/2020, 08:02 - Paul;: Void the season
13/03/2020, 08:03 - Rob;: Such a huge troll
13/03/2020, 08:04 - Paul;: It’s what’s going to happen
13/03/2020, 08:05 - Jack G;: Reset everything, start next season with the same teams across the board as if we were back in August 2019
13/03/2020, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah there would be something beautifully tragic about that
13/03/2020, 08:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Would reaffirm what it is to be a liverpool fan
13/03/2020, 08:12 - Rob;: I think we'd hear more about it than if you were just allowed to win it
13/03/2020, 08:33 - Damian Rumble: Just sneezed. What a relief.
13/03/2020, 10:08 - Sam;: Well if the season is called off I just want to say thanks to klopp and the Liverpool team for granting the little Irish boys wish in his letter to klopp by loosing games and crashing out of the fa cup and Europe.
13/03/2020, 10:09 - Paul;: Liverpool can’t win the league
13/03/2020, 10:09 - Phill: Already won it. Next.
13/03/2020, 10:11 - Phill: If anything, winning it whilst having to adapt to both VAR and Covid is a bigger achievement than anything scrubchester United have done. They had the game on easy mode.
13/03/2020, 10:12 - Phill: We've had to do it with all of these content packs that the FA have purchased
13/03/2020, 10:12 - Rob;: Errrr. I see a _West_ Germany on the list, but I don't see a Germany
13/03/2020, 10:13 - Paul;: Scrubchester
13/03/2020, 10:21 - David;: Champions league ded
13/03/2020, 10:22 - Sam;: This logic.. 😂 PEADOPOOL LOGIC
13/03/2020, 10:23 - Phill: Please explain what is illogical about it being more difficult to win the league whilst 1) adapting to a big change in the rules 2) unpredictable programme and suspension due a pandemic?
13/03/2020, 10:24 - Phill: Compared to DURRgerson just bribing the refs and not having any competition?
13/03/2020, 10:24 - Phill: Your argument is flawed.
13/03/2020, 10:26 - Sam;: Lol. Every team is adapting so PEADOPOOL not disadvantaged.

Then the virus disruption is only hitting the prem in the last two weeks. And again, every team is affected, not just PEADOPOOL
13/03/2020, 10:28 - Phill: And we also had to deal with the winter breaks. So many momentum disruptors. More difficult.
13/03/2020, 10:28 - David;: Sam. We're 25 points clear. Just hush now.
13/03/2020, 10:28 - Rob;: Ferguson did win 13 league titles
13/03/2020, 10:29 - Phill: He bribed the officials to buy extra time in games until they won.
13/03/2020, 10:29 - Sam;: So did every team
13/03/2020, 10:29 - Phill: What's your point? If you have a positive momentum and it is disrupted, it makes things harder.
13/03/2020, 10:30 - Phill: In the same way that it might stop any negative momentum for struggling teams. Making things easier.
13/03/2020, 10:32 - Phill: DURRgy time.
13/03/2020, 10:32 - Sam;: Firstly it was two weeks, after a gruelling festive period. All the teams were glad of it, especially klopp. You’re the first person to argue that the break was actually a negative. Classic PEADOPOOL nonsense
13/03/2020, 10:33 - Jack G;: I’m just sat here hoping not to get relegated
13/03/2020, 10:36 - Rob;: They might just have to start next season with the teams in the same leagues as they started in this season
13/03/2020, 10:37 - Paul;: Wouldn’t count as a win though
13/03/2020, 10:38 - Sam;: I think they’re hoping that they can’t postpone for a month. Euros is cancelled, then we can just have a June season end not May.
13/03/2020, 10:38 - Sam;: *can postpone
13/03/2020, 10:43 - Jack G;: So Europe slots just stay the same as for this season too?
13/03/2020, 10:44 - Rob;: Mindfield, but how else would you do it?
13/03/2020, 10:44 - Rob;: Minefield
13/03/2020, 10:46 - Jack G;: True. Let’s say it’s postponed 2-3 months, can you play the rest of the matches before next season starts? Probably not
13/03/2020, 10:47 - Jack G;: And how would transfer window work
13/03/2020, 10:51 - Sam;: I could only work if the postponement was only a month/ 6 weeks. So if everything could restart in May
13/03/2020, 10:56 - Sam;: But if the season can’t be finished it’s null and void. Nothing won, play off for relegation and Europe.
13/03/2020, 10:58 - Rob;: Liverpool Vs Norwich. Winner wins the title, loser relegated
13/03/2020, 10:58 - Jack G;: If someone gets relegated through playoffs when they’re not currently in the relegation zone they’ll definitely be taking legal action against the league
13/03/2020, 11:00 - Hamish Sinclair: Liverpool not winning the league from Corona will only make them more talked about
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: In 50 years they'll be the kloppsby babes
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: The greatest team of all time to not win the league
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd actually prefer that to being handed the league before the end
13/03/2020, 11:01 - Sam;: A channel 5 documentary and everything
13/03/2020, 11:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Yea yeah, divock origi presenting
13/03/2020, 11:02 - Paul;: A dvd release available at garages across Merseyside
13/03/2020, 11:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Their legend will be so exaggerated, no one will remember that they actually were quite average in 75% of the games
13/03/2020, 11:03 - Sam;: I’m getting this post framed as Phil’s wedding present
13/03/2020, 11:04 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 11:36 - David;: Yeah just push Euros back a year, month suspension, then end season in late June
13/03/2020, 11:37 - David;: Would actually be better for all the players to pass it to each other deliberately now, so the squads work through it quickly and are immune for the April re-start
13/03/2020, 11:38 - Sam;: Yeah everyone is struggling to accept that we actually do need some level of infections to combat it
13/03/2020, 11:40 - David;: Well in the population as a whole it makes sense to smoothe it out but for a football squad with incredibly low risk elite athletes and world class medical facilities you want to spike that fucker up as quickly as possible
13/03/2020, 11:40 - Rob;: I want to get it. Get it over with
13/03/2020, 11:40 - Paul;: Everyone sniffling at work
13/03/2020, 11:40 - Paul;: Are they sure this isn’t it
13/03/2020, 11:41 - Paul;: I’m sure everyone’s got it and it’s mild
13/03/2020, 11:41 - Rob;: Please disease me
13/03/2020, 11:41 - David;: Sniffling not listed
13/03/2020, 11:41 - David;: I also have a sniffle.
13/03/2020, 11:42 - Jack G;: COVID party
13/03/2020, 11:42 - David;: I think this is the placebo sniffle
13/03/2020, 11:44 - David;: placebo sniffle - mid-90s grunge band
13/03/2020, 11:47 - Rob;: 100,000 people thought to have it in Ohio
13/03/2020, 11:49 - Rob;: Almost doubling the worldwide cases
13/03/2020, 11:50 - Jack G;: Any trump says Europe are doing a bad job of containing it
13/03/2020, 11:50 - Jack G;: And*

13/03/2020, 12:03 - Sam;: Even in a pandemic he can’t resist bullshitting and attacking people
13/03/2020, 12:05 - David;: Wearing the cap to the lab trip was my favourite
13/03/2020, 12:05 - David;: And then saying 'they couldn't believe how well I understood this' - with the experts standing next to him
13/03/2020, 12:10 - Rob;: Lol
13/03/2020, 12:10 - Rob;: That's got me

13/03/2020, 12:18 - David;: Better version
13/03/2020, 12:19 - David;: While literally in the same press conference saying he had no idea anyone died of seasonal flu
13/03/2020, 13:16 - Paul;: Impossible to tell what’s placebo and what’s not anymore
13/03/2020, 13:19 - David;: I'm eating lots of vitamin C. Done.
13/03/2020, 13:24 - Paul;: Muscles starting to feel weaker
13/03/2020, 13:25 - Jack G;: Have you recently sneezed though?
13/03/2020, 13:25 - Paul;: Well that’s the issue. Sneezed earlier
13/03/2020, 13:27 - / James Ball: I'm continually wondering if I'm out of breath or just exhaling
13/03/2020, 13:28 - Paul;: Lol
13/03/2020, 13:28 - Paul;: That’s a great predicament
13/03/2020, 13:29 - / James Ball: No longer possible to discern regular breathing from coronavirus
13/03/2020, 13:30 - Paul;: Any fever yet?
13/03/2020, 13:32 - / James Ball: No longer possible to tell if it's cold outside or I'm cold
13/03/2020, 13:33 - / James Ball: Too much coronavirus in the air
13/03/2020, 13:33 - / James Ball: There's nothing for it, I'm going to have to start bottling my piss
13/03/2020, 13:36 - Paul;: I am starting to feel more flu like I think. But could just be a trick
13/03/2020, 13:36 - Paul;: What is real anymore
13/03/2020, 13:37 - Paul;: Better to stay at work and help build up the herd immunity
13/03/2020, 13:54 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-51870445
13/03/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: Feel fine now
13/03/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: Virus done
13/03/2020, 14:16 - David;: Yeah. Belt and braces.
13/03/2020, 14:19 - David;: Ah. We're up to 798 cases
13/03/2020, 14:20 - David;: 300 more in a day. Really got away from us
13/03/2020, 14:21 - Jack G;: Still fewer cases than Italy had deaths
13/03/2020, 14:21 - Jack G;: Everything is fine

13/03/2020, 15:10 - Rob;: You can have that
13/03/2020, 15:11 - Rob;: My best ever idea
13/03/2020, 15:21 - Damian Rumble: Shameless dropping promo for fox news into a serious discussion about what we should do to help prevent a Pandemic. Classic
13/03/2020, 16:47 - Paul;: Got a sore throat now
13/03/2020, 17:14 - Phill: Fine.
13/03/2020, 17:14 - Phill: Whoever topples it has to gump all the fingers
13/03/2020, 17:18 - Phill: Hamish, why is it that children are largely unaffected? Is there something about their immune system that differs from the adult population that doesnt make it spaz out? Would damping down people's immune response to the virus reduce the fatalities? Just give everyone low dose steroids?
13/03/2020, 17:33 - / James Ball: Cooked or frozen?
13/03/2020, 17:35 - Paul;: Full of virus. Spreading to the herd
13/03/2020, 17:55 - Rob;: That's the fun of it. You can play either way
13/03/2020, 17:58 - Hamish Sinclair: The people getting tested are:
1. Those travelling back from danger areas (less children)
2. People admitted in respiratory distress (affects old infirm people/immunosupressed)
3. Those who can pay for a private test
13/03/2020, 17:59 - Hamish Sinclair: There will be a huge number of people with the disease (including children) who may even develop mild symptoms, but wont be tested
13/03/2020, 18:00 - Hamish Sinclair: So children get it, but they are less likely to be put into respiratory failure, and therefore less likely to be tested
13/03/2020, 18:01 - Phill: What sort of immunosuppression we talking? Beccas immune system got blitzed 3 years ago. Would it repopulate to efficient levels in this time?
13/03/2020, 18:02 - Phill: Or is it continued immunosuppression - organ transplants, arthritis, cancer etc
13/03/2020, 18:03 - Phill: It just seems odd to me that that cause of the respiratory issues is an immune response, but seems to impact most on people with weak immune systems?
13/03/2020, 18:05 - Paul;: Agreed, joker is shit
13/03/2020, 18:05 - Paul;: But you can tell when it’s set
13/03/2020, 18:06 - Phill: Paul is your phone sending older messages again?
13/03/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: No, got round to watching to it. Replying to Sam from a few months back
13/03/2020, 18:08 - Sam;: Lol.
13/03/2020, 18:18 - Paul;: Time for nausica

13/03/2020, 18:18 - David;: Strong choice
13/03/2020, 18:19 - David;: Are you ready for it though?
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: I remember you and Phil saying you got high watching it
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Phill: Watched Laputa high as fuck a few weeks ago and it triggered a mental loop for a few days
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: Lol
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: What mental loop?!
13/03/2020, 18:19 - Rob;: I watched Castle in the sky the other week. Low on magic
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: Just repeated mental imagery of the robot blooting the army base
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Rob;: It's quite intense that one
13/03/2020, 18:20 - Rob;: Less wacky, more army
13/03/2020, 18:21 - Phill: Intrusive thoughts in meetings of podsu riding the bug planes
13/03/2020, 18:21 - Paul;: Haha
13/03/2020, 18:22 - Phill: And PODSU PODSU PODSU echoing round my head
13/03/2020, 18:22 - Rob;: Haha
13/03/2020, 18:22 - Paul;: Whilst trying to focus on a meeting
13/03/2020, 18:22 - David;: Lol
13/03/2020, 18:22 - Rob;: Would have been good if they'd turned to you and you just cried out PODSU PODSU PODSU
13/03/2020, 18:22 - David;: Wait Rob laputa is Castle in the sky?
13/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Then it's Hal's moving castle
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Paul;: Howl
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Rob;: Yeah it's called castle in the sky
13/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Yeah yeah
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Phill: >hal
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Phill: >Debora
13/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Same film
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Rob;: Moving castle is different
13/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Yes.
13/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: But Phil was watching castle in the sky
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Paul;: Hal’s moving castle
13/03/2020, 18:23 - Rob;: Castle in the sky is the robot one with Laputa
13/03/2020, 18:24 - Paul;: Larry’s moving castle
13/03/2020, 18:24 - Phill: Bob's moving garage
13/03/2020, 18:25 - Rob;: Hal Robson-Kanu's floating canoe
13/03/2020, 18:25 - David;: Princess mononoke was fucking ridiculous. Watched that high had no idea what was going on at any point. Completely abstract
13/03/2020, 18:25 - Phill: GOAT
13/03/2020, 18:25 - Paul;: Have you watched porco rosso?
13/03/2020, 18:25 - Phill: Not yet
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: Need to watch it
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Paul;: It’s huge
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: >Netflix not having Grave of the Fireflies
13/03/2020, 18:26 - Paul;: Fighter ace pig in the 20’s. Couldn’t be bigger
13/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: The red turtle also worth watching while heavily blooted
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Rob;: Can't penetrate this sentence
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Paul;: That’s porco rosso
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Rob;: Is he a pig that's good at fighting?
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Paul;: Yeah
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Paul;: Flies a sopwith camel
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Phill: A fighter pilot who is a pig.
13/03/2020, 18:27 - Paul;: Yeah
13/03/2020, 18:28 - Paul;: Fights against sky pirates
13/03/2020, 18:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Not sure what she had but presumably shes not still immune suppressed?
13/03/2020, 18:28 - Paul;: A real crooner. Loves fags, red wine and dinner
13/03/2020, 18:28 - Phill: Alemtuzumab
13/03/2020, 18:28 - Hamish Sinclair: We are about to stop giving chemo for several weeks as the risks are probably too high
13/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: Shit show
13/03/2020, 18:30 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
13/03/2020, 18:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Up to 48months I think?
13/03/2020, 18:32 - Phill: Dose for MS is lower for leukemia. 12mg/day for 3 days.
13/03/2020, 18:34 - Phill: Also, thoughts on government response to virus?
13/03/2020, 18:38 - Paul;: Just see what happens
13/03/2020, 18:38 - Hamish Sinclair: She probably still has a good case to be working from home, presumably shes still under follow up?
13/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: Yeah her boss has said she can work from home, but guidance on this from an immune reconstitution pov seems to be difficult to find.
13/03/2020, 18:40 - Hamish Sinclair: I think in most cases the answer is "noone actually knows"
13/03/2020, 18:40 - Hamish Sinclair: She is proabbly at lower risk now than she was at the time, but still I think if you're at risk then best to just be at home
13/03/2020, 18:41 - Hamish Sinclair: As in not go to work, still leave the house
13/03/2020, 18:42 - David;: But that leaves you in December 2022 with your cock hanging out
13/03/2020, 18:44 - Phill: She says thanks for the advice. Decided to wfh indefinitely.
13/03/2020, 18:44 - Damian Rumble: Nah. Got little Oscar didn't it
13/03/2020, 18:44 - Paul;: It’s fucking shit and boring
13/03/2020, 18:45 - Phill: >liking GP. >Liking Joker.>living in London.
13/03/2020, 18:46 - Rob;: Joker was terrible
13/03/2020, 18:47 - Rob;: Phoenix was the only good thing about it
13/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Edinburgh airport ded
13/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Didn't see it. Won't see it. Next.
13/03/2020, 18:55 - Damian Rumble: I'm just a big fan of slow burn psychological thrillers
13/03/2020, 18:57 - Paul;: >incel
13/03/2020, 19:00 - Paul;: You’ve all seen spirited away I presume?
13/03/2020, 19:00 - Rob;: Of course
13/03/2020, 19:03 - / James Ball: Naturally
13/03/2020, 19:15 - Damian Rumble: I haven't actually but eagerly waiting it's arrival on Netflix

13/03/2020, 19:26 - Damian Rumble: What is this?
13/03/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: Looks like David Bowie mate
13/03/2020, 19:31 - Damian Rumble: But why?
13/03/2020, 19:31 - Damian Rumble: Have I missed out on a vital part of meme culture?
13/03/2020, 19:32 - Damian Rumble: Has once again my total lack of knowledge about popular culture let me down?
13/03/2020, 19:46 - Paul;: Have any of you seen annihilation or mother?
13/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: I didn't really like Annihilation
13/03/2020, 19:48 - Paul;: The shimmer though. A lovely holiday to the shimmer
13/03/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: The atmosphere was godo
13/03/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: Just seemed fairly silly
13/03/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: It's directed by Alex Garland who wrote the Beach isn't it?
13/03/2020, 19:50 - Rob;: I really like Ex Machina, he did that too
13/03/2020, 19:59 - Stefan;: Yeah Ex Machina was superb
13/03/2020, 20:00 - Jack G;: Has a great soundtrack too, really puts you on edge

13/03/2020, 20:06 - Phill: Might bed into the castlevania anime on Netflix
13/03/2020, 20:06 - Paul;: Yeah that’s good. Well first season was
13/03/2020, 20:12 - / James Ball: I've got no internet on the new house yet. Would love to get grotty to Netflix but not net to flix
13/03/2020, 20:15 - Damian Rumble: Annihilation was awful. Mother was decent but it was classic case of Netflix stealing concepts from more successful films
13/03/2020, 21:42 - Phill: Pedo Rosso
14/03/2020, 09:29 - Damian Rumble: One of the upsides of the pandemic is that it is now super easy to get gig tickets. Sarah and I are going to see orbital at printworks tonight and we got second hand tickets online for a 1/3 of the price.
14/03/2020, 09:30 - Paul;: Leverage the pandemic
14/03/2020, 09:30 - Paul;: What else can we get on the cheap apart from bog roll
14/03/2020, 09:36 - Jack G;: Flights are pretty cheap atm
14/03/2020, 09:36 - Jack G;: Also corona beer appears to be half price in my local Asda
14/03/2020, 09:40 - Paul;: Got to buy that
14/03/2020, 09:42 - Phill: Classic liberal elite not giving a fuck about anyone else and ignoring advice.
14/03/2020, 09:42 - Damian Rumble: What advice was that?
14/03/2020, 09:53 - Phill: I presume printworks is inside and you'll be in close quarters with lots of other people.
14/03/2020, 09:53 - Phill: The reason they've not banned large public events outdoors is to avoid people reverting to small indoor gatherings.
14/03/2020, 09:54 - Phill: Pubs etc
14/03/2020, 09:55 - / James Ball: The advice to minimise non essential contact with other people
14/03/2020, 09:57 - Damian Rumble: Try enforcing that in literally any city haha
14/03/2020, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Think the whole thing relies on people being responsible
14/03/2020, 10:00 - Rob;: It is on the government to ban events like that if they want absolutely no one to go though
14/03/2020, 10:01 - Paul;: Need to spread to the herd as well
14/03/2020, 10:01 - Rob;: Not saying it's a great idea to go, but if it's been allowed to go ahead some people are going to go
14/03/2020, 10:18 - / James Ball: My coronavirus has died down a lot today. Big sneezing, almost no cough, breathing normal
14/03/2020, 10:19 - Rob;: Sneezing is the kiss of life
14/03/2020, 10:19 - Rob;: The jpeg told us so
14/03/2020, 10:19 - / James Ball: The sweet kiss of sneeze

14/03/2020, 10:30 - Rob;: Apparently that's what all the kids at my housemates school have been saying
14/03/2020, 10:30 - Rob;: Accepted knowledge among teenagers

14/03/2020, 10:58 - Paul;: Soon we’ll be crying out for our quarantine. Playing a psychological game delaying it
14/03/2020, 10:59 - / James Ball: A lovely bit of quarantine would do us good. Reconnect with nature
14/03/2020, 11:00 - Paul;: Rather than being reluctantly forced into it
14/03/2020, 11:19 - Phill: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 12:26 - Damian Rumble: So I take it you will be quarantining yourself and not going to the pub for the next month?
14/03/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: Will be enforced quarantine coming in soon
14/03/2020, 12:27 - Phill: Yes?
14/03/2020, 12:58 - Paul;: Lol woman irate at Waitrose help desk that there was no bog roll
14/03/2020, 13:15 - / James Ball: My work has nearly all been cancelled up to April currently. I'll be bedding in at home and not going out
14/03/2020, 13:15 - / James Ball: Storing my piss in bottles as previously discussed
14/03/2020, 13:16 - Paul;: Yeah best to keep the piss well stocked
14/03/2020, 13:30 - / James Ball: Already quite gouty today with steak and two bottles of red last night

14/03/2020, 16:18 - Paul;: All sold out?
14/03/2020, 16:19 - Paul;: How much supply on average were people buying?
14/03/2020, 16:21 - Rob;: Yeah I haven't seen loo role in the shops since Tuesday
14/03/2020, 16:21 - Paul;: Lol mythical bog roll
14/03/2020, 16:22 - Paul;: Can’t wait to get home and use an entire roll in one shit out of decadence
14/03/2020, 16:22 - Hamish Sinclair: It's the only way
14/03/2020, 16:22 - Hamish Sinclair: You never know when you may need it again
14/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: And it saves you buying bottle water
14/03/2020, 16:24 - David;: Plus an analytic/diagnostic function. Essential monitoring data
14/03/2020, 16:30 - / James Ball: Vital must maintain a full piss log
14/03/2020, 16:31 - / James Ball: Also lemons. No lemons anywhere
14/03/2020, 16:32 - Paul;: What measurement you taking?
14/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
14/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: Temperature, viscosity, specific gravity
14/03/2020, 16:39 - Paul;: How many you getting?
14/03/2020, 16:42 - / James Ball: I'm already stocked
14/03/2020, 16:44 - / James Ball: I saw my neighbours get an Amazon delivery of probably 64 rolls earlier
14/03/2020, 16:44 - Paul;: No taste test?
14/03/2020, 17:01 - / James Ball: Maybe a little sip. Whet my whistle with a quick piss test

14/03/2020, 17:49 - Phill: >his trolley full of bog roll
14/03/2020, 17:50 - Paul;: Yeah the panic
14/03/2020, 17:50 - Paul;: Of course the USA can’t handle it
14/03/2020, 20:34 - David;: Wouldn't predict that
14/03/2020, 20:35 - David;: Completely non-essential. Even a g and t is viable without them. Always a nice to have.
14/03/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: People making honey lemon?
14/03/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: Their vitamin c after tablets ran out?
14/03/2020, 20:55 - Rob;: Could just be an unrelated shortage. A thing I've learned doing stuff for Tesco is that at any one time there are two or three extremely common items that are out of stock nationally
14/03/2020, 20:55 - Rob;: Probably more noticeable at a time like this
14/03/2020, 21:31 - / James Ball: I just wanted to make a lemon chicken roast tomorrow.

14/03/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: We need to chart it. The trends

14/03/2020, 21:40 - Paul;: >not taking your own daily stool sample for investigation
14/03/2020, 21:40 - Rob;: First question on an exam paper once. Where is the mode accurate place to take body temperature and what temperature should it read
14/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: - anus
- 37.7°C
14/03/2020, 21:42 - Phill: >not storing it for a calendar year

14/03/2020, 22:06 - Paul;: Aspirational
14/03/2020, 22:13 - / James Ball: Ex girlfriend used to share a house with a neckbeard. His room just smelt of shit and cigs. He only drank red bull and basically only ate ready meals or takeaway. Worked at an estate agent, ginger, fat. Bed had brown stain in it where he slept and never changed the sheets
14/03/2020, 22:13 - / James Ball: No bed covers, just raw duvet
14/03/2020, 22:14 - Paul;: On raw mattress?
14/03/2020, 22:15 - / James Ball: Nah, a white sheet that was grey from sweat
14/03/2020, 22:16 - / James Ball: Russ was his name. I stole a ps3 controller from his filth pile

15/03/2020, 07:55 - Paul;: I’ll check how busy scumdon is
15/03/2020, 07:56 - / James Ball: Going to Paddington or Marylebone?
15/03/2020, 07:56 - Paul;: Marylebone
15/03/2020, 07:57 - / James Ball: Bicester village also hit hard by lack of chinese
15/03/2020, 07:57 - Paul;: No Chinese round these parts no more
15/03/2020, 07:57 - / James Ball: Tory gov, reducing immigration ✔

15/03/2020, 09:05 - Jack G;: Virus done
15/03/2020, 09:10 - Paul;: Lol that was just the warmup jack
15/03/2020, 09:10 - Paul;: Real virus on its way
15/03/2020, 09:11 - Rob;: So I've developed a tight chest and slight shortness of breath. No cough. No fever.
15/03/2020, 09:11 - Rob;: But that's not a usual think, shortness of breath, is it? Not for me anyway
15/03/2020, 09:13 - / James Ball: Nearly dead Rob., game over

15/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: Why are you coming into the most populated bit of the country Paul?
15/03/2020, 09:17 - / James Ball: Apparently if you deeply inhale and can hold your breath for 10 seconds without pain you don't have pneumonia
15/03/2020, 09:18 - Rob;: Yeah no pain there, just the same mild discomfort
15/03/2020, 09:19 - Paul;: Study weekend for CIPS

15/03/2020, 09:43 - Paul;: You’re in the 14% leading to death
15/03/2020, 09:43 - Sam;: I’m still tip top. Drawing further strength from the panic
15/03/2020, 09:44 - Rob;: I'm annoyed at my very left field symptoms. Just get me the cough and I can stay at home
15/03/2020, 09:45 - Paul;: Maybe start coughing to spur it on
15/03/2020, 09:46 - Phill: Yeah just aggravate your airways by pissing on some bleach and inhaling the fumes
15/03/2020, 09:47 - Phill: Death rate under 60 something like 0.2%
15/03/2020, 09:47 - David;: Best to self isolate. Bed down
15/03/2020, 09:47 - / James Ball: One is 500

15/03/2020, 10:48 - / James Ball: Fever quite high up the list

15/03/2020, 10:57 - Jack G;: Majority of evidence of symptoms gathered presumably from people more seriously affected
15/03/2020, 10:58 - Paul;: Good point
15/03/2020, 10:58 - / James Ball: False conclusions drawn from biased datasets

15/03/2020, 11:19 - Rob;: Starting to look like a sewing machine accident more than a brush with a threshing machine
15/03/2020, 11:24 - / James Ball: Yeah, although my GP surgery may soon stop doing non urgent appointments so I'm facing potentially taking out my own stitches next weekend
15/03/2020, 11:26 - Rob;: Just assimilate them instead
15/03/2020, 11:43 - Rob;: Excellent visualisations and simulations in this

15/03/2020, 13:06 - Rob;: Think I'm going to wfh as far as that's possible as a precaution. They've asked us to stay home if you get anything even slightly related

15/03/2020, 13:25 - / James Ball: This
15/03/2020, 13:27 - / James Ball: Special or slightly unusual pasta easily found still.

15/03/2020, 15:36 - Stefan;: Got some chest tightness, but feels like it's general anxiety
15/03/2020, 15:37 - Stefan;: A massive self-troll

15/03/2020, 18:18 - Paul;: Any symptom developments yet?
15/03/2020, 19:47 - Paul;: How is Italy getting wrecked so hard. Do they have terrible infrastructure? Always kissing to say hello? Big catholic’s so lots of old people in church?
15/03/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: Their healthcare has been rated quite highly
15/03/2020, 20:29 - Sam;: Shit response. They fucked up the containment phase so had to go to full lock down to try and manage the peak.
15/03/2020, 22:23 - David;: Everyone full lock down now. France and Spain as well

16/03/2020, 08:45 - Rob;: It's not persistent at all. Doesn't fit with descriptions
16/03/2020, 08:45 - Paul;: Where’s your fever?
16/03/2020, 08:45 - Paul;: Definitely just a case of breathing out
16/03/2020, 08:46 - Rob;: Maybe that's all this epidemic is. Just a few thousand people breathing out
16/03/2020, 08:49 - Stefan;: No fever though?
16/03/2020, 08:50 - / James Ball: just one big communal sigh

16/03/2020, 09:25 - David;: Yes
16/03/2020, 09:26 - David;: Lol the work email fallout is brutal.

16/03/2020, 09:27 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 09:27 - David;: Mostly old people with retarded grasp of basic IT
16/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: they're destined for death anyway
16/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: wouldn't worry about it
16/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: extrapolating the chinese death rate to the whole uk we would only lose 2.8m people
16/03/2020, 09:32 - Rob;: Only just over five times the yearly number of deaths
16/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: a very minor quintupling of the death rate. nothing to worry about. go back to bed.
16/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: But if we match their infection rate/million to our population it's fuck all
16/03/2020, 09:33 - Damian Rumble: Most of them brexit voters anyway
16/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: Only 80,000 people infected in a 1.4bn population
16/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: yeah but the chinese contained it much better
16/03/2020, 09:34 - / James Ball: death rate seems a better metric
16/03/2020, 09:34 - / James Ball: assume everyone in the uk gets infected
16/03/2020, 09:35 - David;: Plus older population do death rate will be higher here

16/03/2020, 11:07 - Rob;: Does that make them the most affected country per 1000 people
16/03/2020, 11:08 - Sam;: San Marino is having a bit of a shocker. Iceland doing very well.
16/03/2020, 11:09 - Damian Rumble: 0.3% of the entire San Marino population have had Coronavirus
16/03/2020, 11:09 - Sam;: Brazil loving
16/03/2020, 11:10 - Sam;: it
16/03/2020, 11:10 - Damian Rumble: Compared to 0.002% of the UK
16/03/2020, 11:15 - / James Ball: would love a quick holiday to Greenland now. just wait it all out in Nuuk
16/03/2020, 11:18 - Damian Rumble: Or more likely bring the virus over to them and wipe out their civilization. Just like the good old days
16/03/2020, 11:19 - / James Ball: nah nah, no virus here
16/03/2020, 11:47 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 12:04 - Damian Rumble: That's northerners for you
16/03/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: Rob how’s your virus?
16/03/2020, 12:27 - Rob;: Still cough and tight chest, no fever
16/03/2020, 12:27 - Paul;: What’s your temperature at?
16/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: No thermometer, but feels regular
16/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: My finer in my anus feels no warmer than it normally does in there
16/03/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: *finger
16/03/2020, 12:29 - / James Ball: thermometers sold out in boots yesterday
16/03/2020, 12:29 - / James Ball: everyone desperate to get those anal temps
16/03/2020, 12:30 - Paul;: >not permanently leaving a thermometer in the anus and getting second by second readings via Bluetooth
16/03/2020, 12:32 - Damian Rumble: Question. Is it acceptable to steal big roll from work, given the shortages?
16/03/2020, 12:33 - Stefan;: Damo have you tried literally any corner shop in London?
16/03/2020, 12:33 - Stefan;: Gold mines of bog roll
16/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Yeah, and it's often organic and gluten free too
16/03/2020, 13:05 - Paul;: Are they sure this ongoing runny nose and grot isn’t the virus
16/03/2020, 13:20 - David;: Would be good if bog roll becomes our currency unit
16/03/2020, 13:25 - David;: No. Latest research has brought everything we know into doubt
16/03/2020, 13:25 - David;: My grass suggestion isn't going to look so ridiculous in a bit is it. People can just thank me when it does come in handy
16/03/2020, 13:35 - Damian Rumble: Wanna buy this bitcoin? Nah mate I'm only interested in bogcoin...
16/03/2020, 13:36 - Paul;: Rob fever update?
16/03/2020, 13:41 - Rob;: You've got to stop Paul
16/03/2020, 13:42 - Rob;: Unless the fever dream is just you asking if I have a fever over and over
16/03/2020, 13:52 - David;: I think I may as well start wiping with grass now just to become acclimatised to it
16/03/2020, 13:52 - David;: So it isnt a shock when the inevitable happens
16/03/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: Doc leaves the best leaf
16/03/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: Absorbent, moisturising
16/03/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: I tried with an oak leaf once. Too rough
16/03/2020, 14:33 - Jack G;: Surely just only shit directly before a planned shower, no need for anything
16/03/2020, 14:34 - Rob;: Pampass grass the best grass
16/03/2020, 14:37 - / James Ball: No showers in the woods Jack
16/03/2020, 14:42 - David;: How much co-ordination will this take though. Have you ever drunk coffee Jack? The effects are instantaneous and devestating. Impossible to wait until a shower.
16/03/2020, 14:45 - Jack G;: Lol how much are you shitting? No control over your sphincter?
16/03/2020, 14:46 - / James Ball: I was walking in the woods last year near my house. Sudden urge to shit. No choice but to drop trou behind an oak tree
16/03/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: Remind me not to meet you for a coffee Dave
16/03/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: I had to do one in the woods before the reservoir in Wales
16/03/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: Luckily I had tissues on me
16/03/2020, 14:51 - David;: You can't tell me you haven't experienced the purge Carnage of coffee?
16/03/2020, 14:51 - David;: *pure
16/03/2020, 14:51 - David;: Unbelievably loud and incredibly close.
16/03/2020, 14:52 - David;: When it hits there's no negotiation
16/03/2020, 14:53 - Jack G;: It’s definitely speeding up the need to shit but I’m not wearing an adult nappy to cafe Nero, easily manageable
16/03/2020, 14:54 - David;: Well yeah they have toilets. So you're always safe. But you have 5-10 minutes maximum to evacuate your anus after a morning coffee
16/03/2020, 14:56 - Rob;: So if I brought a flask of very strong coffee on a hike through completely barren wildneress with Fay and all our partners there and put you under huge social pressure to drink it, you'd be completely fucked?
16/03/2020, 14:57 - Hamish Sinclair: No
16/03/2020, 14:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Self isolation for symptoms only, not contacts
16/03/2020, 15:03 - Paul;: Guy at work just messaged in to say he has fever and cough
16/03/2020, 15:08 - / James Ball: I've had a whole cafetiere this morning. Diarrhoea no where to be found
16/03/2020, 15:08 - / James Ball: Ah. That's it. Death imminent
16/03/2020, 15:10 - Paul;: Everywhere else we’d be quarantining but have to wait for symptoms
16/03/2020, 15:12 - Jack G;: We’ll have the strongest herd though
16/03/2020, 15:13 - Paul;: Could go touch stuff on his desk
16/03/2020, 15:14 - / James Ball: Give it a lick
16/03/2020, 15:21 - David;: Could go either way. But there's huge risk there. Especially if it was a morning hike.
16/03/2020, 15:23 - David;: If it was in the morning and I'd just had breakfast then there's just no chance of weathering that.
16/03/2020, 15:30 - Jack G;: Are you not just drinking coffee that’s way too strong Dave? Try something milder
16/03/2020, 15:34 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 15:46 - David;: Paul can tell you about coffee
16/03/2020, 15:47 - David;: This is well established
16/03/2020, 15:47 - David;: Even Derek knows
16/03/2020, 15:51 - Paul;: Yeah yeah. Fires up the bowels to produce slurry
16/03/2020, 15:51 - Paul;: Was telling Sam on Saturday how a guy evacuated the cubicle next to me as I had to deal with the coffee effects
16/03/2020, 15:52 - David;: It was so catastrophic that you forced him out?
16/03/2020, 15:52 - Paul;: Yeah it was awful
16/03/2020, 15:52 - David;: I like the story of the phantom desperate shitter in your office
16/03/2020, 15:53 - David;: Always leaving it right down to the wire
16/03/2020, 15:53 - Paul;: Lol he’s disappeared since the cleaners outed the shitter
16/03/2020, 16:04 - Paul;: Now the paranoia creeps in. 2 people out with symptoms
16/03/2020, 16:06 - David;: Ah you're definitely fucked then
16/03/2020, 16:07 - Paul;: But the herd will save me r...right...
16/03/2020, 16:07 - David;: When public health England are saying it will last till next spring what's that based on? There will just be a few grotty cases clinging on still
16/03/2020, 16:08 - Paul;: How’s your arsehole how’s your fever
16/03/2020, 16:08 - David;: Or full blown rim failure still
16/03/2020, 16:10 - David;: I'm a little covid short and stout. How's your arsehole how's your gout?
16/03/2020, 16:18 - Rob;: I think it's based on the idea that the measures we take and the affects of summer will give us some respite in the summer, without having particularly conferred immunity on enough of the worldwide population
16/03/2020, 16:19 - Rob;: Spanish flu did a similar thing, got itself in in three waves of varying severity
16/03/2020, 16:19 - Rob;: Apparently resistance isn't always long lasting with corona viruses
16/03/2020, 16:25 - Jack G;: But hopefully when it mutates it will become weaker though right? Easier to fight off
16/03/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: I don't think you want it to mutate at all
16/03/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: That would wipe out any immunity we have built up
16/03/2020, 16:27 - Jack G;: But isn’t a little mutation just standard? Inevitable when it comes up against an organism with immunity. Otherwise we’d never get colds again
16/03/2020, 16:28 - Rob;: And possibly render our vaccines and antivirals useless
16/03/2020, 16:28 - Rob;: Well colds and flu are seasonal because they mutate a lot
16/03/2020, 16:28 - Rob;: Things like small pox were successfully wiped out before they could mutate
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Jack G;: This is the same brand of virus as the cold so surely we can antipasti it will mutate similarly
16/03/2020, 16:29 - Jack G;: >antipasti
16/03/2020, 16:31 - Rob;: Yeah, it's the same class as some strains of cold, not all
16/03/2020, 16:32 - Rob;: It could be a hard one to get rid of, but I don't think that's very easy to predict
16/03/2020, 16:51 - Sam;: Big update in progress
16/03/2020, 16:51 - Sam;: Get bbc news on
16/03/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: The signing lady definitely making much more blow job-like motions than usual
16/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Everyone working from home
16/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Don't go to pubs or restaurants
16/03/2020, 17:02 - Paul;: Rob you’re locked in for 14 days now
16/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: No mass gatherings
16/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: And that's crufts
16/03/2020, 17:03 - Jack G;: How many is classed as a mass gathering though?
16/03/2020, 17:03 - Jack G;: No one ever says
16/03/2020, 17:03 - David;: Anything that needs emergency services
16/03/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: So not schools
16/03/2020, 17:04 - Damian Rumble: Going to see book of Mormon this evening. Just managed to squeeze it in in time

16/03/2020, 17:09 - Jack G;: Saw river dance at the theatre on Saturday. Last time there for a while I expect
16/03/2020, 17:13 - David;: That's the biggest problem here
16/03/2020, 17:13 - David;: No river dancw
16/03/2020, 17:14 - Rob;: This is such a wonderful comment
16/03/2020, 17:14 - Rob;: I hope this is what get preserved for the museums in centuries timw
16/03/2020, 17:27 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: See the switch there ready and waiting
16/03/2020, 17:33 - Rob;: Yeah, begging for me
16/03/2020, 17:33 - Rob;: Asking after me
16/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: Gris
16/03/2020, 17:34 - David;: It's the video game experience of the century
16/03/2020, 17:36 - Sam;: Toothpaste, Vaseline and bog roll at the desk. Suspect in combination
16/03/2020, 17:36 - Rob;: Yeah that looks bad
16/03/2020, 17:37 - Jack G;: Vaseline. No explanation
16/03/2020, 17:37 - Sam;: Sore lips? (Or nob)
16/03/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: Thanks to the vaseline, neither is sore
16/03/2020, 17:48 - Rob;: Quite weasily to 'not support' mass gatherings and to 'reccomend against' going to pubs etc without closing them
16/03/2020, 17:48 - Rob;: Advice but not action
16/03/2020, 17:49 - Rob;: Quite a lot of room for people to flout that
16/03/2020, 17:49 - Rob;: And for companies to try keep people coming so not to go under
16/03/2020, 17:51 - Hamish Sinclair: In the space of today the answer to this has changed to a yes if she has symptoms
16/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Yeah. Think this is because if they formally close then they have to compensate
16/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: This way they can say 'well you were still open. We'd just told all your customers not to go'
16/03/2020, 19:01 - / James Ball: Ah. Time to bed in for 14 days then
16/03/2020, 19:18 - Damian Rumble: Ah... Book of Mormon cancelled due to virus.
16/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Oh no Damian. Looks like you’re being forced into isolation
16/03/2020, 19:24 - Damian Rumble: Well... We are currently isolating in an Irish pub so could be in worse places
16/03/2020, 19:28 - Rob;: Ok superspreader
16/03/2020, 19:37 - / James Ball: Damian taking no responsibility for his actions
16/03/2020, 19:38 - Damian Rumble: We are basically the only people in here
16/03/2020, 19:38 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 19:38 - Rob;: That would be ironic if the density of flat shares became higher than in pubs
16/03/2020, 19:39 - Phill: Damo, I'm glad you find this funny and don't seem to give a fuck about anyone else.
16/03/2020, 19:44 - Damian Rumble: I'm also going into work tomorrow. Though that is mainly to cycle in and pick up my laptop to go home afterwards
16/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Big theatres should look to sell livestreaming  to Netflix etc. Small theatres fucked, but I'd like to watch starlight express without trousers on without fear of persecution for once in my life
16/03/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Pubs could also livestream the grot in case anyone's interested
16/03/2020, 19:45 - Rob;: I would watch a stream of the people still frequenting the King's arms
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Paul;: Stream of the kebab van
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: Would pay
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: Imagine if it had been broadcasting the moment I hit it
16/03/2020, 19:46 - Rob;: Super bowel level audiences for that
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Paul;: I missed that
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Jack G;: Coming in hot
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Rob;: Ah lol. Bowel
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Paul;: Bowel
16/03/2020, 19:47 - Rob;: Not just any bowel. The Super Bowel.

16/03/2020, 19:55 - / James Ball: what's the sit rep then. need hourly symptom recaps. Rob, Phil and I self isolating
16/03/2020, 20:02 - Phill: No symptoms. Been running. 10k. Lungs fine. Working from home indefinitely.
16/03/2020, 20:03 - Rob;: Still the same. Shortness of breath, mild cough and no fever. Doesn't really fit the symptoms so I reckon I'm fine. But working from home for the foreseeable
16/03/2020, 20:04 - / James Ball: No symptoms, isolating as a household. no work
16/03/2020, 20:27 - David;: So everything's a bit fucked
16/03/2020, 20:27 - Paul;: Lol please elaborate
16/03/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: Interesting time to experience
16/03/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: Couldn’t have predicted this
16/03/2020, 20:29 - / James Ball: certainly the biggest societal thing to happen in our lifetimes so far
16/03/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: Since ww2?
16/03/2020, 20:30 - / James Ball: likely yes in terms of social upheaval
16/03/2020, 20:35 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
16/03/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: The corner shop gold mine
16/03/2020, 20:36 - Phill: Corner shop GOAT

16/03/2020, 20:37 - Paul;: Huge day
16/03/2020, 20:37 - David;: Yeah just in general. A general take on the situation
16/03/2020, 20:38 - David;: Ironic that we had the blitz moment the brexiteers were craving but had nothing to do with brexit.
16/03/2020, 20:47 - David;: I have a feeling the whole thing will be viewed as a massive over-reaction in retrospect
16/03/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: Yeah a bit of cold
16/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: I'd like to dig up some of the early reports back in January
16/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: How minor it seemed.
16/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: Less important than Megxit
16/03/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: Lol yeah no one was paying attention to it. I was following it but didn’t expect it to blow up this much
16/03/2020, 20:54 - / James Ball: we're deep in the corona hole now
16/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: It’s just big news. A big event
16/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: A bumper news event
16/03/2020, 20:57 - / James Ball: how much toilet paper are people stocking
16/03/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: I've got 14 rolls
16/03/2020, 20:58 - Phill: This is the kind of shit I thirst for. It directly impacts me but I still love the suspense.
16/03/2020, 20:58 - Phill: The chaos.
16/03/2020, 20:58 - Paul;: Yeah it makes it interesting
16/03/2020, 20:58 - Phill: Just tuning in from home now
16/03/2020, 20:59 - Paul;: The paradigm shift
16/03/2020, 20:59 - / James Ball: it is good to observe the chaos. I actually have time to watch it and engage for once
16/03/2020, 21:00 - / James Ball: tee
16/03/2020, 21:01 - / James Ball: lol typo

16/03/2020, 21:06 - Rob;: I feel most sorry for Penguin and other publishers
16/03/2020, 21:06 - Rob;: Think about all the fucking terrible virus novel first drafts they'll have to read when they get back to work
16/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: >reading books
16/03/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Lol
16/03/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Surely this is a good time
16/03/2020, 21:09 - / James Ball: just opened my account with the milk man. I'm just going to sit back and have him bring me all the crisis supplies I need
16/03/2020, 21:09 - Phill: Milk AND bottles to piss in
16/03/2020, 21:10 - / James Ball: win win. just converting the milk straight to piss whilst sapping it of its vital calcium
16/03/2020, 21:10 - Phill: Cloudy to clear
16/03/2020, 21:10 - Paul;: Maintain a constant stream
16/03/2020, 21:11 - Phill: <Media omitted>

16/03/2020, 21:12 - Rob;: Our benevolent milk givers
16/03/2020, 21:13 - Jack G;: I’m down to 29 rolls currently, living on the edge

16/03/2020, 21:15 - Paul;: Jack you fell for the great panic
16/03/2020, 21:15 - Paul;: You ruined our supply chains
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Jack G;: Not really. Just bought one pack of 24. Pretty normal
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: Fair enough for the man who's been eating fibre to try and bing himself up
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: I've never seen a 24 pack
16/03/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: Jack, that's bigger than you
16/03/2020, 21:16 - / James Ball: jack's 29 is extreme
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: No one buys a regular 24 pack of bog roll
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: >normal
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: >24
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Phill: Only ever buy a small 4 pack every week/fortnight
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Had 7, bought 24 more
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: No. Maths
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Ah
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Jack G;: Well I heard rumours of the bog roll massacre a week ago so bought a 24 pack instead of a 9 pack. Not like I took every roll of toilet paper in the shop
16/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Had 5
16/03/2020, 21:18 - Jack G;: Just sensible

16/03/2020, 21:20 - David;: Borderline wholesale
16/03/2020, 21:20 - Phill: In all honesty my anus will probably thank me for not brutalising it twice a day with a vigorous wiping
16/03/2020, 21:21 - Phill: Just a gentle rinse rather than dry threshing
16/03/2020, 21:21 - / James Ball: the dry thresh
16/03/2020, 21:21 - / James Ball: can't have that
16/03/2020, 21:21 - / James Ball: we also have some moist wipes. not a fan myself. but good as an anal salve

16/03/2020, 21:25 - Paul;: The full froust

16/03/2020, 21:25 - Phill: Cases will rise. Deaths will spike. Markets will continue to crumble. A child will die.
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Do you think they’ll put us in for the big 12 weeker
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Already getting us prepped
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: They'd never announce 12 weeks from the off
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: Bad for markets
16/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Over 70s they were readying for 12 weeks
16/03/2020, 21:27 - Rob;: Fine. Contribute nothing anyway
16/03/2020, 21:27 - David;: I can't get over the 24 pack. Do they even make those? Meant for large scale events surely
16/03/2020, 21:27 - Paul;: Like a shit party?
16/03/2020, 21:27 - Phill: MS is a 12 week condition so Becca is completely isolated now.
16/03/2020, 21:28 - David;: The mega froust
16/03/2020, 21:28 - Phill: Yeah yeah.
16/03/2020, 21:28 - David;: So that's mandated 12 week lock down?

17/03/2020, 09:01 - / James Ball: the quiet before the storm?
17/03/2020, 09:05 - / James Ball: on the plus side my thumb is no longer quite as swollen and I'm starting to get normal feeling back in it. Ideal for measuring anal temps

17/03/2020, 10:35 - Phill: Hamish is churning guts and a feeling of imminent diarrhea symptomatic of Covid?
17/03/2020, 10:46 - Hamish Sinclair: That's just your arse
17/03/2020, 10:46 - Phill: I blame the higher caffeine coffee at home
17/03/2020, 10:46 - Hamish Sinclair: I think people do get some associated diarrhoea but its less common
17/03/2020, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: I probably dont have the best experience of low level covid, cos all we are seeing is the fucked up lungs
17/03/2020, 10:48 - Phill: How many cases are you seeing?
17/03/2020, 10:48 - Phill: Is ICU full?
17/03/2020, 10:49 - Hamish Sinclair: It's always full but now it's more full
17/03/2020, 10:56 - / James Ball: As bad or worse than flu? Is pneumonia just far more likely with covid-19?
17/03/2020, 11:44 - Rob;: How are all the famous people with no symptoms getting tested for corona virus?
17/03/2020, 11:44 - Rob;: Are private healthcare firms testing?
17/03/2020, 11:44 - Paul;: Think so
17/03/2020, 11:45 - Rob;: Surely that reveals it's much more widespread than official figures
17/03/2020, 11:45 - Jack G;: Best to just assume everyone has it at this point
17/03/2020, 11:49 - David;: My guts are a mess this morning as well
17/03/2020, 11:49 - David;: Nothing that stores left. Fresh stuff fine

17/03/2020, 11:53 - David;: Things not desperate yet
17/03/2020, 11:54 - Paul;: Shops will be full and not sell anything in a week or so time?
17/03/2020, 11:58 - / James Ball: Yeah temporary shortage at best
17/03/2020, 11:58 - Rob;: Yeah, as long as we don't go total lock down food will keep getting grown and manufactured
17/03/2020, 11:59 - Rob;: I guess the European lock downs could potentially disrupt supply chains unless that's been specifically legislated against?
17/03/2020, 12:00 - Paul;: Yeah they’re keeping goods moving
17/03/2020, 12:00 - Rob;: Maybe this is just life now
17/03/2020, 12:00 - Paul;: Otherwise we’d be fucked
17/03/2020, 12:01 - Paul;: I’m CEO of Paul inc at home. Good little gig
17/03/2020, 12:01 - Rob;: Like in the future we'll be regarded as weird and old fashioned for having made friends face to face, going to school etc
17/03/2020, 12:02 - Rob;: Hi, I'm Acting Junior Intern at ROB PLC
17/03/2020, 12:03 - Paul;: Paul industries

17/03/2020, 12:33 - Phill: Sambo what are your thoughts on the covid-19 bioweapon conspiracy?
17/03/2020, 12:57 - Damian Rumble: Euros ded
17/03/2020, 13:00 - Sam;: nah. covid has happened because the chinese are detty pigs.
17/03/2020, 13:01 - Rob;: This is a very good argument for veganism
17/03/2020, 13:01 - Rob;: Most epidemics or pandemics have origins in animal farming
17/03/2020, 13:02 - Paul;: Farming the pangolin
17/03/2020, 13:02 - Phill: Or top secret government labs
17/03/2020, 13:04 - Rob;: Sold in markets with farmed and wild animals in hugely close quarters
17/03/2020, 13:06 - Paul;: Don’t see many pangolins round these parts
17/03/2020, 13:28 - David;: Never eaten a pangolin

17/03/2020, 13:47 - Paul;: Lol
17/03/2020, 13:55 - Phill: Lol that the Big Brother contestants in Germany have no idea
17/03/2020, 14:03 - Damian Rumble: The big brother house is actually a pretty decent place to ride this out
17/03/2020, 14:03 - Phill: Yeah
17/03/2020, 14:04 - Phill: They just emerge in a few months and everyone is dead
17/03/2020, 14:04 - Damian Rumble: Completely sealed. Unlimited food/drinks. Lots of very rutable house mates
17/03/2020, 14:10 - David;: The 12 week isolation for serious conditions only kicks in at the weekend apparently Phil
17/03/2020, 14:11 - David;: So Becca can go absolutely mental until then.

17/03/2020, 14:13 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 14:20 - Paul;: Lots of people not leaving (if they stick to it) until end of June. Mad
17/03/2020, 14:20 - Paul;: Just bedding in
17/03/2020, 14:20 - Paul;: The eternal froust
17/03/2020, 14:21 - David;: The grot will get so deep
17/03/2020, 14:25 - Paul;: Should all go to magnetogorsk
17/03/2020, 14:25 - Paul;: The classic froust
17/03/2020, 14:25 - Paul;: Our bodies would rot before the covid got us
17/03/2020, 14:53 - David;: I feel ravaged after 3 days of wales. Far worse than a flu.
17/03/2020, 14:53 - David;: So extrapolate that to 3 months.
17/03/2020, 14:53 - Paul;: Deep deep rot
17/03/2020, 14:54 - Rob;: I don't imagine the vulnerable groups will be caning the nos balloons, Mandy, LSD and ket quite so harf
17/03/2020, 14:54 - Rob;: Can have showers too
17/03/2020, 14:54 - David;: What else are they going to do to pass the time?
17/03/2020, 14:55 - David;: Fortunately the dark web does deliveries
17/03/2020, 15:05 - Stefan;: Warnings going out not to take ibuprofen if you've got the virus
17/03/2020, 15:45 - David;: Almost 2,000 cases now
17/03/2020, 15:58 - Jack G;: 2150 deaths in Italy. That’s mental
17/03/2020, 16:21 - David;: All quite fucked
17/03/2020, 16:22 - David;: But then chief scientific advisor says cases could peak in 2 weeks.
17/03/2020, 16:22 - David;: How does that fit with the 12 month prediction?
17/03/2020, 16:22 - Paul;: 2 week peak would be fine
17/03/2020, 16:22 - David;: Everyone's flailing around essentially.
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: Peaking for now? Before summer camps it down a bit?
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: Lol
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: Damps it down
17/03/2020, 16:23 - David;: Just camp that down
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: I wouldn't say it was an overly camp virus
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Stefan;: Lol, currently the virus is massively camping it up
17/03/2020, 16:23 - Paul;: put a camp on it. i've always said that
17/03/2020, 16:24 - David;: Virus starts making people talk like Graham Norton
17/03/2020, 16:24 - David;: Reduces the intensity
17/03/2020, 16:24 - Stefan;: Billions of tiny Dale Wintons infecting us all
17/03/2020, 16:25 - David;: So it's 2 weeks but 18 months. Wut?
17/03/2020, 16:25 - David;: Think it will blow over in a few days.
17/03/2020, 16:26 - David;: This will all look very embarassing
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Stefan;: I thought he said it'll take 2-3 weeks just to tell how well the current measures are working
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: Seasonal winter 19/20 peak, then a summer trough, then perhaps a winter 20/21 peak
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Paul;: need a good storm to bed into whilst working from home. that would improve the situation
17/03/2020, 16:26 - Stefan;: Because of lag time in infections causing symptoms and then people getting tested
17/03/2020, 16:26 - David;: Nah think that was saying of measures work the cases will start reducing in 2 weeks
17/03/2020, 16:27 - Stefan;: Number of confirmed new daily cases will start reducing, yeah
17/03/2020, 16:27 - Rob;: Lol. Andrex have dropped their coupon in the May issue of the mag. Took them this long to realise they didn't need to discount to sell more
17/03/2020, 16:28 - David;: Yeah. So it's actually fuck all.
17/03/2020, 16:28 - David;: 2 weeks then eases off. Why then is everything shit down for months
17/03/2020, 16:28 - David;: They've johnned it quite hard
17/03/2020, 16:30 - Rob;: But if unquarentine you're just back to where we were the other day, unless there's no one left in the UK who has it and flights remain grounded
17/03/2020, 16:33 - Paul;: Asked if the new coronavirus measures could be in place for 18 months, the government’s chief scientific officer, Sir Patrick Vallance told the Health Select Committee he doesn't know.

However he said they are likely to last for months, “certainly not a couple of weeks”.

He told MPs the UK is "nowhere near ready" to be talking about releasing the measures.

"When we have got to the stage where we can keep the outbreak below NHS capacity and keep it there, that’s the time when can talk about releasing it," he said.

"It is going to be data driven," he added.
17/03/2020, 16:34 - Damian Rumble: I reckon give it a month or two of everyone being on edge working at home and then we'll all get fed up and will be all the more willing to get back to normal and sucking up having to deal with a the mild cold of everyone getting it.
17/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: and all our parents dying
17/03/2020, 16:34 - Sam;: You cretin
17/03/2020, 16:34 - Paul;: damian cannot grasp these kind of things
17/03/2020, 16:39 - Damian Rumble: If Brexit proved anything is that people quickly get tired of endless uncertainty and will swallow just about anything that allows them to get back to thier lives with the minimal inconvenience to themselves, and with little thoughts to everyone else.
17/03/2020, 16:40 - Paul;: lol this is a virus damian
17/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: “Together you should expect those to have a very significant effect on the peak and we should start to see the rates come down in two or three weeks’ time,” he told the committee.
17/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Next.
17/03/2020, 16:40 - / James Ball: let's just get on with our lives and buy shares in funeral businesses
17/03/2020, 16:42 - David;: 20,000 deaths predicted, vs 8,000 from normal seasonal flu every year. So it's basically a bad case of seasonal flu
17/03/2020, 16:43 - / James Ball: just massively overwhelming capacity
17/03/2020, 16:44 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 16:44 - David;: Ordered in some light reading
17/03/2020, 16:44 - / James Ball: > #1 Best Seller
17/03/2020, 17:01 - Stefan;: #1 best selling of the philosophical tracts on plague
17/03/2020, 17:08 - / James Ball: my first job in May has now cancelled
17/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: currently facing a £6000 loss now in what was shaping up to be a bumper year
17/03/2020, 17:10 - Rob;: The gov have to compensate at some point. There will be so many points this affects
17/03/2020, 17:10 - Rob;: And long-term this will fuck a lot of full-time employees too
17/03/2020, 17:17 - Rob;: 10k cash grants for small businesses
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: No mention of sole traders
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Damian Rumble: Going to be a mean recession after all this forsure
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: 15% of GDP stimulus package
17/03/2020, 17:18 - Paul;: backing everything
17/03/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: Would be funny if the idiots get their blitz spirit moment but all it brings us is far left socialism level of spending and rendering Brexit irrelevant
17/03/2020, 17:25 - Stefan;: All these idiots who didn't live through the blitz and think it means carrying on exactly as normal
17/03/2020, 17:26 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 17:29 - Paul;: https://youtu.be/nc8uqDnl4wc
17/03/2020, 17:29 - Paul;: these types of people
17/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: cash grants don't have to be repaid
17/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: £10k to tide you over there James
17/03/2020, 17:36 - / James Ball: 10K is realistically what I'll be looking at as a shortfall soon
17/03/2020, 17:39 - Sam;: Was rishi referring to the self employed as well or just ‘business’
17/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: technically once you are self employed you are a business
17/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: ltd company would be the next step up
17/03/2020, 17:41 - Sam;: 👍🏻
17/03/2020, 17:41 - Jack G;: Ball Ball & Ball Ltd
17/03/2020, 17:55 - Rob;: How many rolls left now Jack?
17/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: might end up with money directly in our accounts from the gov
17/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: a cheeky £1k. bunce
17/03/2020, 17:59 - Jack G;: Is this mortgage holiday excluding interest as well? No point not paying if interest will just rack up
17/03/2020, 18:01 - Rob;: Just 1k for everyone?
17/03/2020, 18:01 - Paul;: something like that. What they're going to do in USA and already did in Hong Kong
17/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: direct payments to get people through
17/03/2020, 18:02 - Rob;: So £67 billion?
17/03/2020, 18:02 - / James Ball: pocket change
17/03/2020, 18:02 - Rob;: Some idiots will really waste that
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Jack G;: How is it paid out though? Seems like a logistical nightmare
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Rob;: Hi many loo rolls is £1000?
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Phill: They don't find it that hard when they want your tax
17/03/2020, 18:03 - Paul;: NI #? Electoral roll and cheques sent out or something
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: this is only me theorising
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Jack G;: Still at 31, used less than a quarter of a roll today
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: just your normal everyday 24 roll purchase
17/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: i hope you're happy that you're responsible for the panic
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Phill: Alex Salmond must be loving the Covid smokescreen
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: You said 29 yesterday. You didn't go out even more did you?
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Jack G;: I must have miscounted
17/03/2020, 18:05 - Paul;: so much roll can't even count it properly
17/03/2020, 18:06 - Rob;: Keeping it in a huge vault like scrooge mcduck
17/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: A quarter of a roll in a single day? This is absurd
17/03/2020, 18:07 - Jack G;: Less than a quarter Dave. And that’s two people
17/03/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: so you have at least 4 months supply
17/03/2020, 18:08 - Rob;: Jack don't spend your thousand on more roll
17/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: But the fact you can even say you're approaching a quarter per day
17/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: We use maybe a roll every week or two
17/03/2020, 18:10 - David;: Lot of paper in a roll
17/03/2020, 18:10 - Jack G;: How though if you’re shitting every 30 minutes from drinking coffee? Are you one wipe and done every time?
17/03/2020, 18:10 - Sam;: What’s the usual sheets per roll?
17/03/2020, 18:10 - Rob;: I think we use 2 a week between 3. Used to be 1 roll a week when it was only men
17/03/2020, 18:11 - Paul;: lol
17/03/2020, 18:11 - Rob;: Yeah Dave, anecdotally you shit a lot more than you seem to wipe
17/03/2020, 18:11 - Rob;: Old Cyril Smear
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Phill: Wheres this grotty grand come from?
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Phill: Complete bollocks
17/03/2020, 18:12 - David;: a) my office bears the brunt of the coffee shots; b) that's one short sharp shit per day, then shit once more per day at most on average
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: Yeah, the presence of women will throw out your consumption rates
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Paul;: that was my prediction of what could come next
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Jack G;: But that office bog roll will need to be transferred to your house once quarantine sets in
17/03/2020, 18:12 - Rob;: You just can't shake a pair of flaps
17/03/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Would be better to pump £68bn into SME cash flow so they can keep paying their staff than to just give every fucker a grand
17/03/2020, 18:14 - David;: Isn't that just a much less direct way of achieving the same thing?
17/03/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: yeah, it might pay to be more direct in this situation
17/03/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: calm panic etc
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Phill: No, what 5 year olds need a grand? And also, a grand won't cover my expenses. So I'd rather have my salary.
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Paul;: you still get your salary
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Paul;: everyone in hong kong got $10k HK dollars
17/03/2020, 18:15 - Phill: Not if I lose my job because my company doesn't have cash to pay people
17/03/2020, 18:16 - / James Ball: this sounds pretty much like my experience
17/03/2020, 18:17 - Jack G;: New hearthstone expansion then, might have to re-download for quarantine
17/03/2020, 18:17 - Paul;: https://finance.yahoo.com/news/its-time-for-free-money-from-washington-190321406.html
17/03/2020, 18:18 - David;: Lol they obviously wo t give it to 5 year olds. How many 5 year olds have an NI number and bank account?
17/03/2020, 18:19 - Damian Rumble: Loving how after literally a decade of saying can't borrow our way out of a difficult situation, the Tories have just borrowed 15% of GDP in a single day to do exactly that. 

Not saying that I am critical of the move, but you have to admire the incredible hipocracy on show
17/03/2020, 18:19 - David;: Plus yeah you still get your salary. A supplement not a replacement otherwise that would be a pay cut for most people
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: My point is people have different financial needs. Take two people who lose their jobs because their companies have no cash flow. One has monthly outgoings of £1k the other lives in Kent and has a £2k mortgage.
17/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: The point of this measure would be to catch people not on standard pay rolls like James.
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Paul;: too difficult to identify the needy - just give to everyone
17/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: There are additional measures to support business cash flow
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: Fine, give it to them, and then keep the other business afloat
17/03/2020, 18:20 - Phill: Like what.
17/03/2020, 18:21 - David;: All the loans and tax relief they just announced?
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Jack G;: So is this 1k for all actually happening or is it fake news?
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Phill: Our payroll is £120k per month, and we are already talking about laying people off.
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Paul;: fake but just a hypothesis
17/03/2020, 18:21 - Phill: Not enough in reality. Tax relief does not equal liquidity.
17/03/2020, 18:23 - Rob;: I love how seriously we're debating Paul invented measure
17/03/2020, 18:23 - / James Ball: this. I'm in a different industry but cash flow is vital in my sector too
17/03/2020, 18:24 - David;: But there are also grants and loans
17/03/2020, 18:24 - Phill: 10k - 25k
17/03/2020, 18:24 - Phill: Enough for a week
17/03/2020, 18:24 - David;: The US may do this, and it's been suggested by a lot of people here. Not just DePaul uk
17/03/2020, 18:25 - Paul;: £5m loans for SME companies with no interest for at least 6months
17/03/2020, 18:25 - David;: Yeah lol. Very much not 25k
17/03/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: still crippling though. needs to be grants if you want companies to survive
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-guidance-on-social-distancing-and-for-vulnerable-people/guidance-on-social-distancing-for-everyone-in-the-uk-and-protecting-older-people-and-vulnerable-adults
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: Oops
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 18:26 - Jack G;: It makes no sense. I agree with a Phil it’s a pointless solution that most people will just spend on rubbish. Need to pump money into the system to keep businesses paying staff and out severe penalties in place for any bollocks where businesses are avoiding paying staff etc
17/03/2020, 18:27 - Phill: A £5m loan is bollocks as it will cripple low margin industries for years
17/03/2020, 18:27 - David;: They are doing that as well Jack.
17/03/2020, 18:28 - David;: Also why do you assume people would spend a 1000k grant on rubbish bit not their wage packet?
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51932403
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Paul;: 5 minutes ago!
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Jack G;: >cheques
17/03/2020, 18:28 - Phill: Because I know most of my staff in London run out of money every month because they spend it on coke?
17/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: So pay them less wages. They're just spending it on rubbish.
17/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: Unecessary
17/03/2020, 18:29 - Phill: But give them a grand. Ok Karl.
17/03/2020, 18:30 - David;: Lol the illogic. Can't reason with that
17/03/2020, 18:30 - Jack G;: >Tracking people’s spend and giving the a pay cut because they spend money on anything leisurely
17/03/2020, 18:31 - Paul;: jack are you on both sides of the argument?!
17/03/2020, 18:32 - Jack G;: No I’m just pointing out how ridiculous it is to pay people less money based on what they spend it on
17/03/2020, 18:32 - David;: Lol but you are using that exact logic to oppose the 1k
17/03/2020, 18:32 - Paul;: but that was your entire point against the £1k
17/03/2020, 18:33 - Jack G;: No I’m against the £1k because people will spend it on crap. But you’re saying if that’s the case then they shouldn’t be paid that money in the first place. Very draconian
17/03/2020, 18:35 - David;: No I'm pointing out there is no difference between 1k in wage support or 1k in grant in terms of the demand it generates and the liquidity it creates
17/03/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: wages = spend on coke (supported by grant) - £1k from government = spend it on coke
17/03/2020, 18:37 - Paul;: peoples behaviour will be the same
17/03/2020, 18:37 - Phill: A 1k grant to individuals creates no liquidity for businesses.
17/03/2020, 18:37 - Phill: Nor does tax relief
17/03/2020, 18:38 - Phill: Nor does a huge loan at an unspecified interest rate after 6 months foster any sort of sustainability
17/03/2020, 18:38 - David;: We need people to spend money on 'crap' because that crap is generally businesses, that employ people and pay other businesses.
17/03/2020, 18:38 - Paul;: if you witheld cash now it would be much worse
17/03/2020, 18:38 - David;: The second 2 do exactly that. The first does so indirectly
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: How does tax relief create cash?
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: It just means you pay less cash.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: You're not given cash.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: It's cash that is not leaving your bank account.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Paul;: keeps cash on the balance sheet
17/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: Hence you have more cash
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: Lol so deluded.
17/03/2020, 18:39 - David;: Lol
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Phill: So many companies have cashflow issues at the moment
17/03/2020, 18:39 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 18:40 - David;: So Phil somebody says you dont have to pay any bills or mortgage this months. That leaves with no more cash at the end of the month?
17/03/2020, 18:41 - David;: Hence the loans and grants. You seem unable to grasp that there are multiple different measures to do different things.
17/03/2020, 18:41 - Phill: Again, grants are up to 25k and a loan is a loan. Repayable.
17/03/2020, 18:41 - / James Ball: I would rather not take anything than take a loan
17/03/2020, 18:42 - Phill: You seem to live in some sort of fantasy land
17/03/2020, 18:42 - / James Ball: I'd just have to take some other work instead
17/03/2020, 18:42 - / James Ball: loan would be too destructive
17/03/2020, 18:43 - Phill: Tax relief is a reduction in outgoings, not a sustaining of income.
17/03/2020, 18:45 - David;: Paying no tax helps you cover other costs, including your wage bill.
17/03/2020, 18:45 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 18:47 - David;: Yeah, hence a grant would be more appropriate for you. OR, direct income support to get you through the next couple of months. That's why you have different measures. A sole trader has different requirements to an SME, that has different requirements to a ftse 250 company etc. etc.
17/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: What's illogical is saying 'im a full time employee of a medium sized company, hence all government support should be given in a form that most directly benefits me'
17/03/2020, 18:49 - Rob;: This has been fucking brilliant btw
17/03/2020, 18:49 - Sam;: Yeah, STFU Phil. 🖕🏻
17/03/2020, 18:50 - Sam;: Everyone happy to have an update from southcombe garage yeah?
17/03/2020, 18:50 - Rob;: Yeah thank Christ
17/03/2020, 18:51 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: Ok, I agree that needs are different, but tax burden is also different, yet they are applying a one size fits all tax relief programme?
17/03/2020, 19:21 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Lol in other news just received this. Killed me
17/03/2020, 19:22 - Phill: As an example - construction company with turnover of £10m and pre tax profit of £3m. Said company also factors into their cash flow a tax rebate for r&d. The company has very high costs, staff, vehicles, materials, suppliers to pay. The tax relief is not likely to sustain said company for any length of time. Whereas pumping bunce into it, based on employee number, rather than "chucking everyone a grand" will do much more
17/03/2020, 19:23 - Phill: £3m should read £0.3m
17/03/2020, 19:24 - Phill: Said company also takes out a loan of £1m. Company pays back 100k for 10years plus interest. It's not a good position for low margin industries. Construction, retail, hospitality.
17/03/2020, 19:26 - Phill: A large insurance company, with high profit margin and low costs, with a high tax burden - sure
17/03/2020, 19:31 - David;: Yeah I see the point. But what they are facing is a very severe but temporary loss of revenue. So there it would seem logical to have enforced unpaid leave or temporary staff layoffs - as being done by airlines - rather than indiscriminately wanging all companies cash. The problem that creates is for the workers, which the income support would offset. Alternatively you keep them in work doing nothing and potentially having to work from home. But that's much less direct, and it has uneven effects on competition - e.g. some companies in a better cash position might use it to start a price war and gain market share or something. And as an additional benefit to the cash grant you would get a general demand stimulus across the entire economy, which also helps businesses
17/03/2020, 19:32 - David;: Thanks SgtDavid
17/03/2020, 19:54 - Phill: Agreed, but the collapse of a supply chain would not be a temporary loss of revenue. It would be long term and many contracts in an order book, which has been used to plan, goes out the window. We will see how this plays out but I would bet on loads of the big construction companies completely collapsing, and with them their supply chains.
17/03/2020, 20:04 - David;: Yeah. I doubt it, for big companies like that I imagine the government  will negotiate specific deals or restructure loans to have such a long repayment window to be essentially free money.
17/03/2020, 20:05 - David;: But yeah I mean it's a shit show companies will go bust. A few companies going busy would not be a bad thing as they are likely the shitest run and others will mop up their market share and expand.
17/03/2020, 20:05 - David;: *bust
17/03/2020, 20:06 - Rob;: Thanks SgtDavid
17/03/2020, 20:06 - David;: Part of the problem with QE after the financial crisis was it kept shit companies going to ease unemployment. The long term consequence was shite productivity which were still living with
17/03/2020, 20:06 - Damian Rumble: Jesus how is this conversation about Paul's claim that everyone is getting a grand still going on lol
17/03/2020, 20:06 - Paul;: You wait till we get that grand
17/03/2020, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: Yes. Great. Then James will be 9k short of what he could have earnt rather than 10k
17/03/2020, 20:09 - David;: You down the pub then Damo?
17/03/2020, 20:09 - David;: Licking the door handles
17/03/2020, 20:09 - Rob;: Playing spin the bottle down an old people's home
17/03/2020, 20:15 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: How many football clubs could go under from this?
17/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: Could be mental
17/03/2020, 20:21 - David;: Wreck the league pyramid potentially
17/03/2020, 20:22 - David;: Would be good if it led to mad promotions - forest green up to the prem
17/03/2020, 20:22 - / James Ball: Charlbury Town FC gone
17/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: Oh Nick don't go
17/03/2020, 20:23 - Paul;: Ducklington going under
17/03/2020, 20:24 - David;: Burst the 20 year football bubble. Maybe they'll all go back to being plumbers. Born and raised in the town
17/03/2020, 20:24 - Rob;: While Messi and Ronaldo are getting 80K a day to do keepie uppies from home
17/03/2020, 20:25 - Paul;: Billionaire owners might sell up
17/03/2020, 20:25 - David;: They'll have to retire. No one left to pay their wages
17/03/2020, 20:25 - Paul;: City back to grotting about
17/03/2020, 20:26 - Rob;: I'll buy a club with my grand
17/03/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: Pitch together
17/03/2020, 20:30 - / James Ball: do a real life fantasy football
17/03/2020, 20:30 - / James Ball: football much more interesting when it's held in bloodthirsty underground arenas
17/03/2020, 20:32 - Paul;: According to that imperial report we will only get restrictions 2/3 of the time then get the rest of the time to go mental before putting restrictions back on
17/03/2020, 20:33 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 20:38 - / James Ball: they're the wild weeks
17/03/2020, 20:38 - / James Ball: full anarchy for a few weeks then back to lock down
17/03/2020, 20:40 - Stefan;: Isn't the problem that everyone will have a fucking mad one, thereby spreading the virus twice as fast compared to a regular Friday night out
17/03/2020, 20:40 - Paul;: Nah. Get dat herd immunity
17/03/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: Plus majority will already have had it
17/03/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: Dat initial peak
17/03/2020, 20:42 - David;: Lol, from famine to feast. Gorging on transmission while we get the chance
17/03/2020, 20:42 - Phill: Herd immunity is supposed to generated via vaccine, not infection lol
17/03/2020, 20:43 - Stefan;: Yeah and if it's kept at a rate that's sustainable for NHS to cope with, it'll take years before enough of the population is immune
17/03/2020, 20:43 - Stefan;: And that's assuming infection does confer long lasting immunity
17/03/2020, 20:44 - Phill: Why does it take so long to get a fucking vaccine?
17/03/2020, 20:44 - Phill: Surely we can just print vaccines now we can sequester DNA?
17/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: Increase NHS alongside though so shortens the time
17/03/2020, 20:46 - Rob;: Safety and efficacy trials mostly
17/03/2020, 20:47 - Rob;: A lot of that can be sped up surely
17/03/2020, 20:48 - Rob;: Standard testing for all medicine involves multiple trials starting with small trials of uncomplex organisms, then working up through bigger groups of more complex things before arriving at human trials
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: They already started human trials yesterday
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: But vaccines are in principle relatively simple compared to a drug
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: Skipped all those stages
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: Yeah, I imagine they don't give much of a shit at this point
17/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: Also probably the worst outcome is you give someone corona
17/03/2020, 20:50 - David;: Would be good if they stumble on a great vaccine really quickly but comes with terrible side effects.
17/03/2020, 20:50 - David;: It also acts as an intense and instant laxative
17/03/2020, 20:50 - Paul;: That’s coffee
17/03/2020, 20:50 - Paul;: Already exists
17/03/2020, 20:51 - David;: But coffee doesn't vaccinate against covid-19 as far as I'm aware
17/03/2020, 20:51 - David;: If it does I'm fine
17/03/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: Hard to see why a vaccine would do that, should just be a key protein from the virus's surface
17/03/2020, 20:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Has to be given on the toilet
17/03/2020, 20:51 - Hamish Sinclair: Perhaps the delivery mechanism
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Covid free or long term laxative. That’s your options
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Rob;: 'they accidentally isolated the SHIT protein'
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Ruins your guts for a year
17/03/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Forced to isolate anyway due to explosive shitting
17/03/2020, 20:52 - David;: Has complex higher level emergent effects that no one could model. But makes you shit yourself
17/03/2020, 20:54 - David;: Yeah so we get herd immunity but accompanied by herd incontinence
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Our ward today ran out of masks
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Rob;: Fuck
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: The bog roll now seems petty
17/03/2020, 20:54 - David;: Ah. You'd think masks would be a minimum
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Hamish Sinclair: The rules in the hospital change daily but normally because of supply issues rather than evidence based practice
17/03/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: Lol the herd incontinence
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Everyone got fit tested for these big one use only hazmat suits, and then the hospital instantly ran out of them
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: Are you seeing a lot more admissions to icu?
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Yesterday we had 56 people with suspected covid
17/03/2020, 20:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Today 90
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: All pneumonia?
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Lots of negative tests aswell though
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: Ah
17/03/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: So regular seasonal stuff intermingled
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Stefan;: Are you testing everyone with pneumonia symtoms? And what's the turnaround time?
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Could catch covid in the meantime
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Turn around for testing was up to a week last week
17/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: Are there enough tests even?
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: A double hit
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Which is why they stopped testing I the community
17/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Have flu already then catch covid
17/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Sp now you only get tested if you need admission
17/03/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: by which time you could be symptomless or dead I suppose
17/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: What's the demographic spread that you see in the hospitals with it?
17/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: If you go to a&e with the symptoms but dont need admitting then you are told to self isolate but not tested
17/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: All older?
17/03/2020, 20:58 - Hamish Sinclair: We havnt seen alot of positive yet so hard to judge
17/03/2020, 21:00 - Hamish Sinclair: On an average day you would still expect a fair few admission with pneumonia, it's just now they are all concentrated in one place
17/03/2020, 21:01 - Stefan;: 1,950 positive tests out of more than 50,000 nationally
17/03/2020, 21:02 - Hamish Sinclair: I've not seen alot of young people, but I dont work on intensive care
17/03/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: Are you having to work much longer shifts?
17/03/2020, 21:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Not yet
17/03/2020, 21:03 - Stefan;: Do you think they should shift some of the testing capacity to frontline staff, rather than patients? Or does that just require way more capacity than we have
17/03/2020, 21:04 - Hamish Sinclair: But they anticipate that 50% of the work force will have to isolate in the next 4 weeks
17/03/2020, 21:04 - Hamish Sinclair: So that will likely change
17/03/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: The working from home and social distancing will surely have a positive effect
17/03/2020, 21:06 - Rob;: I've probably had a few hundred fewer interactions already, at population level that's huge
17/03/2020, 21:06 - Paul;: Yeah massive
17/03/2020, 21:06 - / James Ball: problem is the relatively long incubation though?
17/03/2020, 21:06 - / James Ball: people already infected waiting for it to burst out of the chest
17/03/2020, 21:06 - Paul;: Lol
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: That’s why they’ll do a mandatory quarantine
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Rob;: Yeah, so we'll suffer for a week or two with the outcome of the last couple of weeks of unfettered mixing
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: I feel better now than I have done in a week and a half
17/03/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: Like the grot is ebbing away
17/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: The persistent cold disappearing
17/03/2020, 21:08 - / James Ball: yeah I'm feeling good apart from the threshing accident on the thumb
17/03/2020, 21:08 - / James Ball: even that's pretty good now
17/03/2020, 21:08 - / James Ball: the grot skin has been shed
17/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Need that test to see if you’ve already had covid
17/03/2020, 21:10 - Hamish Sinclair: At present the biggest obstruction to fflow through the hospital is people awaiting results for "suspected" covid
17/03/2020, 21:11 - Hamish Sinclair: So the priority is to spend up in hospital testing to move people along
17/03/2020, 21:11 - / James Ball: could they be told to go home and act as if they are infected until they get results
17/03/2020, 21:11 - / James Ball: or are we talking people in need of immediate care
17/03/2020, 21:11 - Hamish Sinclair: The policy of not testing is  actually fucking us over massively as it's very easy to just tell someone to self isolate, but potentially dangerous If they then have to miss radiotherapy/chemo
17/03/2020, 21:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Only people unwell enough to need admission are tested
17/03/2020, 21:12 - Hamish Sinclair: This is what's happening
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Hamish Sinclair: New kitchen knives?
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Rob;: Exactly
17/03/2020, 21:13 - Phill: Stoned and I blew on the picture to try and clot it
17/03/2020, 21:14 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Your gif folder must be so well indexed
17/03/2020, 21:15 - / James Ball: Phil's gif game is always on point
17/03/2020, 21:16 - / James Ball: yeah, looks gnarly enough though. at least yours was a clean cut. One of the reasons I needed 7 stitches was because it was such a jagged cut
17/03/2020, 21:16 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:17 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:18 - Rob;: It got very wobbly. I just showed it to a doctor in the pub rather than going in. They said it might be fine, and they were right. Did seem to be dying for maybe 48 hrs
17/03/2020, 21:21 - David;: Ah. That's fucked. Sliced a good quarter through there.
17/03/2020, 21:22 - David;: I can report my toenail has just now returned to normal. So a good 7 month re-growth period
17/03/2020, 21:22 - / James Ball: ah, we needed weekly updates
17/03/2020, 21:22 - / James Ball: the full 7 month regrowth as a gif
17/03/2020, 21:23 - / James Ball: I don't have any pictures of mine unsewn up but it was basically half way through my thumb - palm side to knuckle side
17/03/2020, 21:24 - / James Ball: I held it up immediately after it happened and could see through my thumb
17/03/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: Ah
17/03/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: No
17/03/2020, 21:25 - David;: Hit bone?
17/03/2020, 21:25 - David;: Bone saves all
17/03/2020, 21:25 - David;: The classic backstop
17/03/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: plausible. I think it didn't quite as it missed the tendon
17/03/2020, 21:28 - Rob;: The tendon saved me
17/03/2020, 21:28 - / James Ball: essentially it went in at the thumbtip and then runs down the palm side to the first knuckle
17/03/2020, 21:29 - Rob;: Tendon Rodgers
17/03/2020, 21:29 - / James Ball: about 20mm along the thumb and about 10mm into it
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: Burglars will be fucked
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: I hope the gov has thought about them
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Phill: No
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: Everyone in
17/03/2020, 21:36 - Phill: Because we're all getting a grand
17/03/2020, 21:37 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:38 - David;: Dem gifs
17/03/2020, 21:39 - Paul;: Everyone gets a grand
17/03/2020, 21:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Paul's fucking grand. The theory that launched a thousand arguments
17/03/2020, 21:41 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:42 - Sam;: Mnuchin says they’ll give a grand out on a means tested basis
17/03/2020, 21:43 - Phill: Hamish are you/NHS doing any weird experimental shit in ICU? Like fiddling around with pressures and tidal volumes on the ventilator to see if anything works?
17/03/2020, 21:43 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:44 - Phill: Like now they seem to have discovered don't take ibuprofen (fake news probably plugged by the paracetamol market)
17/03/2020, 21:44 - Sam;: My old chin broke. Here’s Mnuchin.
17/03/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: Very good
17/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:45 - Sam;: Dave, all of those are funny for the audio not the visual. You goon
17/03/2020, 21:45 - Paul;: Yeah get no audio from them
17/03/2020, 21:46 - David;: They are audio-visual clips. I get the full audio
17/03/2020, 21:46 - Sam;: Anyone else?
17/03/2020, 21:47 - Phill: Yeah full audio here
17/03/2020, 21:47 - Phill: You two probably own iPhones
17/03/2020, 21:47 - David;: There you go. Get a proper device.
17/03/2020, 21:48 - David;: You are staring down the barrell of an mp4 file. Nothing more elaborate than that
17/03/2020, 21:49 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/03/2020, 21:49 - David;: Lol that particular reaction
17/03/2020, 21:50 - Sam;: The gulp
17/03/2020, 21:53 - Rob;: This will always be in my heart
17/03/2020, 21:56 - Sam;: Gin and tonic is so fucking good
17/03/2020, 21:56 - David;: Yeah
17/03/2020, 21:57 - David;: It really takes an edge off
17/03/2020, 21:57 - Sam;: I can really feel why they thought it had restorative properties. Just tastes like it cutting through the issue. Some issue.
17/03/2020, 21:58 - David;: An unspecified issue is really being dealt with
17/03/2020, 21:58 - David;: That'll be the quinine there boi
17/03/2020, 21:58 - Sam;: Yeah yeah. Just don’t question anything. Dat quinine
17/03/2020, 21:59 - Phill: Maybe quinine has anti Covid as well as anti malarial properties
17/03/2020, 22:01 - / James Ball: back on the red tonight. french. beaujolais
17/03/2020, 22:01 - Phill: Really need to panic buy some wine
17/03/2020, 22:02 - / James Ball: my dad has panic bought flour for his bread making. 28Kgs
17/03/2020, 22:02 - / James Ball: wine always good, drinking through my stash of nice gift wine
17/03/2020, 22:02 - Sam;: Lol. Laura was in Tesco yesterday. Most people panic buying the usual. One woman just had 12 bottles of wine. Nothing else
17/03/2020, 22:03 - Paul;: Flours all sold out
17/03/2020, 22:03 - / James Ball: direct from the mill
17/03/2020, 22:03 - Paul;: Derek’s been stocking up as well
17/03/2020, 22:04 - David;: Judith says in chippy there is fresh stuff but nothing dry in Aldi but no fresh stuff and loads of staples in co-op
17/03/2020, 22:04 - David;: Not sure how that's happened
17/03/2020, 22:05 - David;: Sold out of exactly opposite categories of food
17/03/2020, 22:06 - Sam;: No one likes the fresh stuff in also. Closer to end of life, that’s why it’s cheaper.
17/03/2020, 22:06 - Sam;: Goes off quicker
17/03/2020, 22:06 - / James Ball: my dad said no meat but fish in co-op today
17/03/2020, 22:07 - David;: Fake news. Their avocados take fucking forever to ripen
17/03/2020, 22:07 - / James Ball: Lidl best of both worlds. superior to aldi
17/03/2020, 22:07 - Paul;: That’s the opposite of what you want from an avacado. They do opposite foods
17/03/2020, 22:08 - David;: Ah well yeah I shop at Lidl.
17/03/2020, 22:08 - David;: Maybe it's completely different
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Sam;: Lol. Apart from the avocados. Their ripening works in reverse
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: Or you put your thumb through them as you try to pick them up. Either or
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Sam;: Better to be more ripe
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Better to be a mushy paste
17/03/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: >eating avocados
17/03/2020, 22:09 - David;: No - want to plan meals later in the week. Don't want an avocado shooting it's load on Monday when I'm having fajitas on Thursday do I?
17/03/2020, 22:14 - Rob;: This is why they sell ready to eat and ripen at home ones
17/03/2020, 22:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah this is based on very weak evidence in influenza, but ultimately paracetamol generally safer than ibuprofen anyway
17/03/2020, 22:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Not working in ITU but to be honest the entire speciality seems to be based on people fiddling about with ventilators
17/03/2020, 22:38 - / James Ball: had a ready to eat lidl avocado today. was perfect. no thumb holes
17/03/2020, 23:11 - Sam;: Quavers are great as well
18/03/2020, 01:13 - David;: This is the kind of analysis we'll need to get through this
18/03/2020, 08:20 - Damian Rumble: Madness. Everyone knows the fresh stuff from Aldi/Lidl is shit. Most of the time it's rotten before you've even got home.
18/03/2020, 09:20 - David;: You don't even eat fresh things damian how would you know about this. I don't believe they sell turkey twizlers
18/03/2020, 09:26 - Rob;: But he's right
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: It is more frequent that their stuff has a mouldy potato maybe
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: But I'm a lidl concert
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: Lol
18/03/2020, 09:30 - / James Ball: Convert
18/03/2020, 09:31 - / James Ball: Can't do a full shop there. Need Waitrose or sainsburys for middle class essentials
18/03/2020, 09:33 - Damian Rumble: I don't think I've eaten a turkey twizzler in over 20years
18/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: In other news the milk man delivered today. He was out of stock of croissants so left me two packs of pain of chocolate and inexplicably a 4 pinter of milk along with my glass bottle of organic
18/03/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: Eating them subconsciously eh? No memory of them twizzling in
18/03/2020, 10:00 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 10:52 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 10:52 - Rob;: Last night's argument over Paul's fictional grand reminded me a lot of this
18/03/2020, 10:54 - Paul;: Lol that’s a great argument
18/03/2020, 10:54 - Paul;: That’s a fact
18/03/2020, 10:54 - Rob;: You don't even understand what a fact is
18/03/2020, 11:02 - Stefan;: The day after his birthday, he is no longer 28
18/03/2020, 11:02 - Stefan;: Pretty sure that happens on your birthday
18/03/2020, 11:32 - David;: Lol you're saying £1.75 is a pound
18/03/2020, 11:32 - David;: Like that argument in the thick of it - 'the events leading up to the first world war do not include the first world war'
18/03/2020, 11:44 - Damian Rumble: Glastonbury ded
18/03/2020, 11:46 - David;: So it's peaking in 2 weeks. Yet everything is now cancelled until the autumn.
18/03/2020, 11:55 - Jack G;: Had work from a friend who works in the civil contingencies secretariat, apparently London will be going into full lockdown similar to Paris on Thursday
18/03/2020, 11:56 - Paul;: Just London?
18/03/2020, 11:57 - Jack G;: Yeah, apparently London is 4 weeks ahead of the rest of the UK
18/03/2020, 11:58 - Rob;: I had heard the same about Thursday from a police officer. Looking forward to moving house during that
18/03/2020, 12:11 - Damian Rumble: I should probably go and buy some food
18/03/2020, 12:13 - / James Ball: don't go to Aldi/Lidl
18/03/2020, 12:13 - Jack G;: More importantly, bog roll
18/03/2020, 12:13 - / James Ball: they don't have turkey twizzlers
18/03/2020, 12:14 - Damian Rumble: Big roll is all gone. Will buy twizzlers though to wipe my arse with
18/03/2020, 12:22 - David;: You've abandoned your roots. The classic Damian meal was turkey twizlers with cheesy chips and a ring doughnut
18/03/2020, 12:23 - David;: What would be your average go-to dinner these days?
18/03/2020, 12:29 - Damian Rumble: For lunch I quite like to whip up a baguette stuffed with rocket, brie, chicken and pesto. Or occasionally hammcoch Ham, extra mature cheddar, Caesar dressing over mixed salad leaves with some English mustard thrown in for good mixed
18/03/2020, 12:30 - Damian Rumble: There was great dive bar that sold mixed jerk chicken and mutton curry with rice, peas and plantain but I don't work near that place any more sadly
18/03/2020, 12:31 - Sam;: Hammcoch Ham
18/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Hammcoch Ham
18/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: >7
18/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Thanks SgtDavid
18/03/2020, 12:34 - / James Ball: Hammcoch Ham, thrown in for good mixed
18/03/2020, 12:35 - Jack G;: Sounds pretty good to be fair
18/03/2020, 12:35 - Jack G;: But I’m more interested in dinner
18/03/2020, 13:31 - Paul;: School closures incoming
18/03/2020, 13:36 - / James Ball: No way they can stay open
18/03/2020, 13:36 - / James Ball: I just had my last job cancel
18/03/2020, 13:36 - / James Ball: I'm now essentially unemployed
18/03/2020, 13:40 - Paul;: What do you do now in terms of claiming for things?
18/03/2020, 13:43 - / James Ball: No idea, nothing more than vague promises from the government, no actual action as yet
18/03/2020, 13:46 - Phill: It's ok, just take out a loan and don't pay any tax. Problem solved.
18/03/2020, 13:46 - Rob;: Sorry this is fucking you first James
18/03/2020, 13:47 - Sam;: from the FSB James
18/03/2020, 13:47 - Sam;: https://www.fsb.org.uk/campaign/covid19.html
18/03/2020, 13:47 - Rob;: I'm sure the new, robust Universal Credit system will be up to supporting you quickly. Have only heard good things
18/03/2020, 13:48 - Rob;: My company is pretty fucked. More than half the clients are airlines. I'm in the safer side of the business on Tesco, who are getting the loo roll millions, but it looks like 'voluntarily' paycuts are coming for us all.
18/03/2020, 13:49 - Rob;: Great time to have bought a house. Buy high sell low. Always said that
18/03/2020, 13:52 - Stefan;: Shit, sorry to hear it James
18/03/2020, 13:56 - / James Ball: I'm fortunate in that the job I've just been doing has paid well and I've got a lot in reserve. I'm sure I'll pick up more work later in the year as things progress but as it stands I have no income until possibly August/September now
18/03/2020, 14:18 - Sam;: are you looking into getting a cash grant?
18/03/2020, 14:24 - / James Ball: It's been announced but no information on how to claim yet
18/03/2020, 14:34 - David;: They've got to relax the benefit claim rules now. 'Tried looking for work again. Still none - virus sweeping the globe'
18/03/2020, 14:35 - David;: >the loo roll millions
18/03/2020, 14:38 - David;: I am also about to be unemployed. Contract ends in early April. They were just going through the process of extending it to September but now have no money due to the Asian students all fucking off and not applying to study for next year. Going to rinse higher education. Then all the other job and funding applications I have in I imagine no one is looking at as they are too busy writing coronavirus response guidance.
18/03/2020, 14:40 - / James Ball: that's shit as well.
18/03/2020, 14:41 - / James Ball: I'm worried for Will Ball's girlfriend. She is flying in from Serbia today to start a new job at Greenwich University, full time lecturer position. If that goes, so does her visa.
18/03/2020, 14:49 - Rob;: This is such a dry hump of a crisis
18/03/2020, 14:49 - Rob;: Over it
18/03/2020, 14:54 - Paul;: My mums moping around now
18/03/2020, 14:58 - David;: Yeah. I don't imagine they would cancel a position they have already appointed. It's more that they will not advertise for some positions for September they may otherwise have done.
18/03/2020, 14:59 - Rob;: The job market generally will be fucked for the foreseeable, won't it
18/03/2020, 14:59 - David;: Yep
18/03/2020, 14:59 - Rob;: We've suspended freelance bookings and new hires
18/03/2020, 14:59 - Rob;: People will accept wage reductions in those conditions
18/03/2020, 15:00 - David;: Plus if this happens and then student numbers actually hold up she may be fucked with higher teaching loads.
18/03/2020, 15:17 - David;: This does sound more like human-grade food. But what are you doing in the evenings?
18/03/2020, 15:23 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 15:26 - David;: How shit is the area of houses they've developed behind where the water tower is?
18/03/2020, 15:27 - David;: The encroaching metropolis
18/03/2020, 15:27 - Paul;: That’s been there for ages but fucking shit
18/03/2020, 15:27 - Paul;: Building new ones behind them as well. The soulless suburb
18/03/2020, 15:27 - Paul;: They look like houses that should only be built in the West Midlands outside of Birmingham
18/03/2020, 15:28 - Phill: Bet Christine is fuming but too scared to touch it incase contaminated
18/03/2020, 15:30 - David;: Yeah, hate that style of houses where it nods towards cotswold villiage but actually identical new build grot
18/03/2020, 15:30 - Paul;: Thin walls as well
18/03/2020, 15:30 - David;: Pretends to be twee
18/03/2020, 15:30 - David;: May as well paint a fake thatch texture onto the slates.
18/03/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: Prices will come right down. Mark and Karen have now lost their middle management jobs
18/03/2020, 15:31 - David;: Plus they never build any new infrastructure just houses.
18/03/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: Who will buy these places now
18/03/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: Yeah no infrastructure
18/03/2020, 15:32 - David;: Will become a dormitory town
18/03/2020, 15:32 - David;: have they not all been sold yet?
18/03/2020, 15:32 - Paul;: No still under construction
18/03/2020, 15:33 - David;: Weeeel
18/03/2020, 15:36 - Paul;: Wonder how much house prices will drop by
18/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: I don't want to think about that
18/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: To close
18/03/2020, 15:37 - Rob;: Too*
18/03/2020, 15:38 - Paul;: I’m buying at the moment. Locked in. Kicked off the process 2 weeks ago
18/03/2020, 15:38 - David;: If you're planning to live there for a few years it should recover by then
18/03/2020, 15:38 - Rob;: We've fixed for 5 years, so fingers crossed
18/03/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: Have exchanged, so legally it all has to go ahead. Wonder how that will work if they do enforced lockdown
18/03/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: Where?
18/03/2020, 15:40 - David;: Selling the shart?
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: Chippy. Hitchmans mews
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: Shart is sold
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Rob;: Get us a link Paul
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: It’s not on the market
18/03/2020, 15:40 - Paul;: Bought it off market
18/03/2020, 15:41 - Paul;: But it’s a Victorian mews house that will be refurbished by some architects
18/03/2020, 15:41 - Paul;: Assuming the virus doesn’t put a stop to it all
18/03/2020, 15:42 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 15:43 - David;: Where in Chippy?
18/03/2020, 15:44 - Paul;: Hitchmans mews. Pretty much opposite where the shart is
18/03/2020, 15:45 - David;: Sorry don't have the Chippy A-Z memorised in my head
18/03/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: The Lane next to winebear / where betfair is. Opposite old mill cafe
18/03/2020, 15:46 - David;: Ah so you'll be even closer to winebear
18/03/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: It’s closed down
18/03/2020, 15:46 - David;: Was going to happen. But has the pizzeria he tried to replace it with also gone?
18/03/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: Yep
18/03/2020, 15:47 - David;: Decline and Fall. What's richard going to do with himself now? Where can you go from there?
18/03/2020, 15:48 - Paul;: I’m not actually sure where he is
18/03/2020, 15:48 - David;: Very Icarus
18/03/2020, 15:48 - Paul;: He was in France working in a ski resort bar I think
18/03/2020, 15:49 - David;: Can't imagine him holding down a 9-5 now
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: So far today I have been to two co-ops. Iceland. Waitrose. And a bunch of small corner shops. None of which have had a big roll.
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Rob;: Sure that will be going just fine right now
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: Big*
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: Bog*
18/03/2020, 16:04 - Damian Rumble: 7
18/03/2020, 16:08 - David;: How many rolls are you down to?
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: 5
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: In a house of 4
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: Two women
18/03/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: Do the math
18/03/2020, 16:12 - Rob;: Ah you're fucked
18/03/2020, 16:18 - Paul;: That would be 0 days
18/03/2020, 16:20 - Damian Rumble: At lunch I saw a news clip on BBC one that effectively went like this...

[Anchor] - super markets have been opening thier doors early to allow elderly people a chance to visit the stores safely. 

Cuts to interview with some old women carrying two massive 24 packs of bog roll and a shopping trolley filled with more 

[Boomer, to interviewer] - well it's really nice to allow us to pop in early and get myself some loo roll. ... And this one is for my friend...
18/03/2020, 16:27 - Paul;: >boomer
18/03/2020, 16:30 - Jack G;: You’re finished, no chance. Might as well call it a day
18/03/2020, 16:31 - Jack G;: Sitting pretty at 31 rolls still
18/03/2020, 16:33 - / James Ball: jack the hoarder.
18/03/2020, 16:33 - / James Ball: normal 24 jack
18/03/2020, 16:34 - Paul;: Just your normal 24
18/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: we have 13 plus 2 on the go
18/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: >2 toilets
18/03/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: >can both simultaneously shit
18/03/2020, 16:35 - Rob;: Greater than two toilets but less than 3?
18/03/2020, 16:36 - / James Ball: yeah yeah. full toiler
18/03/2020, 16:53 - David;: Have 5 left. I'm not even remotely worried
18/03/2020, 16:54 - David;: Will start to think about it when there is half a roll left on the reel
18/03/2020, 16:55 - Jack G;: Literal squeaky bum time
18/03/2020, 16:56 - David;: That's still 5 shits or so. Couple of days. So I'll just start to bear it in mind at that point.
18/03/2020, 16:58 - David;: 31 rolls is complete madness. You've lost your senses
18/03/2020, 16:59 - Sam;: Don’t forget Dave that all your shit are happening at home now... work toilet can’t take the brunt off your shit for you now.
18/03/2020, 16:59 - / James Ball: I also think the coffee shits is fake news
18/03/2020, 16:59 - / James Ball: I'm on my fourth mug now and yet to shit
18/03/2020, 17:00 - David;: Yeah but I maybe shit twice a day. Now one of those is at home rather than work.
18/03/2020, 17:00 - David;: What kind of coffee?
18/03/2020, 17:00 - / James Ball: 3x fresh cafetiere mugs and 1x instant
18/03/2020, 17:00 - Sam;: Doubled the demand you were previously placing on your rolls
18/03/2020, 17:01 - David;: True but doubling from a very low base
18/03/2020, 17:01 - David;: I'm not overly concerned
18/03/2020, 17:01 - Rob;: What's Fay's consumption like?
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Jack G;: You’re way too confident here Dave
18/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Don't feel the need to get a years supply in
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Damian Rumble: Hoping this rumor of shutting down London is just a rumour. I won't last 3 months with such dire loo roll supplies
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Rob;: I can't get over how much more women use
18/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Jack you're part of the problem.
18/03/2020, 17:02 - Rob;: I lived with women at uni, but I'd forgotten what the loo roll demand was like
18/03/2020, 17:03 - Jack G;: Not really. I bought one pack of 24. Regular (apparently) people like you wouldn’t go anywhere near that so you’re not missing anything
18/03/2020, 17:03 - David;: Haven't noticed it - to be fair she often buys the loo roll that's partly where this complacency stems from. I just assume theres always bog roll there.
18/03/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: But you already had 7 rolls when you bought it
18/03/2020, 17:04 - Jack G;: And who’s laughing now?
18/03/2020, 17:04 - David;: My feeling is this is an artificial temporary problem caused by people needlessly clearing out the stock currently on the shelves. Everyone will now have loads so as it is restocked demand will be less. That's when I enter the market
18/03/2020, 17:05 - David;: There will likely be an oversupply crisis as they adjust to higher demand but everyone is in fact shitting at just the same rate as always. I can clean up on the lower prices that may bring.
18/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Who's laughing then Jack? As you work through your 31 rolls bought at the peak of the bubble
18/03/2020, 17:08 - Jack G;: I think I’ll be alright. An extra £1 now is worth having no stress about whether I can afford to shit or not
18/03/2020, 17:20 - Jack G;: All schools shut from Friday then
18/03/2020, 17:23 - David;: Schools ded
18/03/2020, 17:23 - Jack G;: Exams over?
18/03/2020, 17:24 - David;: So that's all sectors also ded. Everyone having to stay at home to look after children.
18/03/2020, 17:25 - Phill: Man I fucking wish I was still at school. Year 10. Would just fucking slam hours and hours into wow .
18/03/2020, 17:26 - Jack G;: Exams cancelled too. Epic for year 10’s
18/03/2020, 17:27 - Sam;: Children of key workers like NHS staff and delivery drivers will have special provisions so they can still work
18/03/2020, 17:28 - Rob;: Yeah, that GCSE summer was long as it was
18/03/2020, 17:29 - Rob;: Now it starts in March. So much football manager
18/03/2020, 17:30 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 17:31 - Rob;: 18!
18/03/2020, 17:31 - Damian Rumble: Notice I have gone for a socially acceptable 18 rather than hording over 30
18/03/2020, 17:31 - David;: Yeah. Hundreds of seasons. Could start a real project. League 2 to European champions
18/03/2020, 17:31 - Sam;: Fake news then
18/03/2020, 17:32 - / James Ball: 2 packs
18/03/2020, 17:32 - / James Ball: hoarding
18/03/2020, 17:32 - Phill: Big fan of the kebab van sauce selection in the background
18/03/2020, 17:32 - Phill: Garlic. Burger. Brown.
18/03/2020, 17:32 - David;: Thing is they will just have to do it next year? So sort of shit
18/03/2020, 17:33 - David;: Hanging over you longer
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: So everyone kind of misses a year
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Phill: And gets a grand woop
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Phill: Woop whoop
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Jack G;: Not this again
18/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: The grands coming
18/03/2020, 17:34 - Phill: #granddesigns #grabagrand #prosecco #livelovegrand
18/03/2020, 17:34 - David;: Ariana grand
18/03/2020, 17:36 - Rob;: Will we just get a thick generation now? Generation dumb
18/03/2020, 17:36 - David;: Lel would be so shit to be a child of a key worker. The only ones in school while everyone else gets pissed and plays football manager
18/03/2020, 17:37 - Jack G;: Can’t be having a Bloody Sunday though with social distancing in place
18/03/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: There were only 54 kids at Great Tew primary, might just be one kid with a parent key worker
18/03/2020, 17:38 - / James Ball: no exams means no a-levels means no university enrolments?
18/03/2020, 17:38 - David;: Yeah that's potentially fucked up everything
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: Just write off this year
18/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: a gap of one year at both year 7 and higher education next year
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Jack G;: Probably go off predicted grades
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Jack G;: And any coursework
18/03/2020, 17:39 - David;: Nah, you can't do that
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: If only we had cryogenic freezing. This would be easy to fix
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: That’s like letting Liverpool win the league
18/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: not convinced
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: You can’t count the coursework
18/03/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: Yeah. Impossible
18/03/2020, 17:40 - Jack G;: It’s either that or everyone redoes the year
18/03/2020, 17:40 - Rob;: What if Man City get your A-levels instead? Can't rule it out
18/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: gap year and just do your exams in the summer
18/03/2020, 17:40 - David;: No, just have the exams in the autumn and start year 1 uni in January possibly. But that's fucked as well
18/03/2020, 17:40 - / James Ball: *autumn
18/03/2020, 17:40 - Jack G;: It’s the premier league conundrum amplified
18/03/2020, 17:41 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 17:42 - / James Ball: If 2020 is so fucked now can we just roll the new year forward.
18/03/2020, 17:43 - / James Ball: New year in August, new year, new start. Just wipe the slate
18/03/2020, 17:43 - Paul;: Wipe the arse
18/03/2020, 17:43 - David;: They only allowed us 2 months of fucking normality between Brexit and Corona
18/03/2020, 17:44 - David;: Thought that was the crisis over? Nah mate, we're shoving a global pandemic up your national sphincter
18/03/2020, 17:45 - / James Ball: almost 3000 dead in Italy now
18/03/2020, 17:46 - Damian Rumble: And in those two months all of Australia was burnt to the ground and most of the UK flooded
18/03/2020, 17:47 - Jack G;: Lol Boris completely ignoring the question about brexit transition period and extending it due to pandemic taking up all government time
18/03/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: That’s schools shut all the way through till September then?
18/03/2020, 17:48 - / James Ball: quite likely
18/03/2020, 17:48 - Damian Rumble: Love that. It's Jan 202. We're about to told we are going into quarentine for a second time, only this time it's straight off the back of a no deal brexit
18/03/2020, 17:48 - Phill: Just your average afternoon in storm wind jack
18/03/2020, 17:48 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: How to being a nation to its knees in under 5 years
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Damian Rumble: Bring*
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Jack G;: Irresponsible wow players. Auction house and bank should be avoided according to quarantine measures
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Phill: I'm a big fan of quarantine. My productivity is through the roof.
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Phill: I've got relatives bringing me shopping which I don't have to pay for.
18/03/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: Quarantine might extend beyond 3 months as well do you think?
18/03/2020, 17:49 - / James Ball: grants not loans
18/03/2020, 17:51 - Jack G;: Unlikely. Think it will end in May but then a second smaller quarantine over winter when the virus makes a cone back
18/03/2020, 17:52 - Phill: I don't have to get out of bed until 8:25
18/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: I think we’re fucked. Year in isolation
18/03/2020, 17:53 - David;: Can we just go back to the strategy where we let everything run loose and hope for the best. That seemed much nicer.
18/03/2020, 17:54 - Rob;: Yeah, was a fan
18/03/2020, 17:54 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah, and a nice cafetière as well rather than crappy office coffee
18/03/2020, 17:54 - Rob;: Back when we were a herd
18/03/2020, 17:55 - David;: Yeah, pining our hopes vaguely on herd immunity. Everyone gets the flu and then gets on with it.
18/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: So they will give qualifications somehow. But not specified how.
18/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Excellent
18/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Everyone gets straight Cs? Leveling up
18/03/2020, 17:58 - Phill: >not buying a cafetiere on your first day, people taking the piss, now everyone has one.
18/03/2020, 18:01 - David;: Johnson looking quite ropey in this one. Should probably have PM shift working.
18/03/2020, 18:02 - Phill: Yeah thought he was looking very clammy
18/03/2020, 18:03 - David;: Vallance as well. Looks knackered. Less assured than the first few
18/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: So teachers still have to work just to look after key worker children? How's that going to work?
18/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Reckon that is probably a very good idea
18/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: I think all key workers children will be in school doing remote learning
18/03/2020, 18:11 - Hamish Sinclair: But the child care is key
18/03/2020, 18:12 - David;: Yeah agree they need to go somewhere. But weird to make secondary School teachers cover that
18/03/2020, 18:12 - Phill: They're not exactly going to be doing anything else
18/03/2020, 18:13 - David;: True but so every teacher - English, maths, science etc. to teach a handful of children? Or one goes in per day and they get straight maths, straight english? Classes covering all age groups or still split by year group? Just don't get practically how that would function
18/03/2020, 18:14 - David;: Also ironically they will be getting taught content while no one else is - puts them at an unfair advantage?
18/03/2020, 18:15 - David;: Unless its like end of term days at chippy where they stick Blackadder on and pretend it teaches us about WW1
18/03/2020, 18:16 - Jack G;: It’s an unprecedented situation. No one has ideal solutions and honestly there probably aren’t any
18/03/2020, 18:16 - Paul;: One solution is to always buy your normal everyday 24 pack of bog roll though
18/03/2020, 18:16 - Jack G;: 👍
18/03/2020, 18:18 - Hamish Sinclair: I dont think they will have classes
18/03/2020, 18:18 - Hamish Sinclair: They will have remote learning/online learning
18/03/2020, 18:18 - Hamish Sinclair: So will all essentially be babysat at school
18/03/2020, 18:18 - David;: So going school to be taught by teachers who are at home?
18/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: Italy put 10k student doctors into service 9 months ahead of schedule. Same here do you think?
18/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: I dont think anyone is being taight
18/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: I suspect all schools will use online resources
18/03/2020, 18:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Possibly
18/03/2020, 18:20 - Jack G;: >Mr Wooldridge trying to teach his class physics over google hangouts
18/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: Lol
18/03/2020, 18:20 - David;: Woodridge
18/03/2020, 18:20 - / James Ball: thought this too. cumpled suit, crooked tie, very coronavirus about the face
18/03/2020, 18:20 - / James Ball: They'll have to have staff in though for H&S reasons at least
18/03/2020, 18:21 - / James Ball: the final few months of physics were just Look Around You on the projector
18/03/2020, 18:21 - David;: Yeah that's what I was thinking. Once you have anyone there you need security, catering staff, cleaners
18/03/2020, 18:21 - / James Ball: his literal countdown to retirement on the top corner of the board
18/03/2020, 18:22 - David;: Mental with the exams. You can't go on grades predicted a year before the exams to determine university entry
18/03/2020, 18:22 - Jack G;: Should have done better at AS level Dave. Next
18/03/2020, 18:23 - / James Ball: very ropey. Harriet pointed out there will be a number of students already accepted but deferred start ie gap yahh
18/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Would be ridiculous. Especially as they sometimes deflate predicted grades to impact their metrics on how many student over-perform predictions. So an incentive to under-predict
18/03/2020, 18:24 - / James Ball: can't let students attend (and take on the financial responsibilities) to have them take exams in autumn and fail
18/03/2020, 18:24 - / James Ball: January start? Most universities already do a September and January intake?
18/03/2020, 18:25 - David;: We don't do January intake. It's possible but they would be butt hurt if they paid full tuition fees for 1/2 year of teaching. Plus, they would miss a lot of content. That's 1/6th of a standard BA course.
18/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Government could refund tuition fees I guess.
18/03/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: Yeah, January intake but then Universities have to do an additional summer term?
18/03/2020, 18:27 - David;: That's possible. People would hate that as that's the only part of the year we get any research done usually.
18/03/2020, 18:28 - / James Ball: That's true, I've got friends in research units who would hate it. It's just going to fuck everything for a whole cycle
18/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: Yeah it's all pretty fucked
18/03/2020, 18:32 - / James Ball: https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html
18/03/2020, 18:32 - / James Ball: good to have the live stats readout
18/03/2020, 18:33 - David;: Wonder if this will usher in a new welfare state as happened following WW2. Johnson/Churchill - Starmer/Attlee?
18/03/2020, 18:34 - David;: https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ this is also decent.
18/03/2020, 18:54 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 18:55 - / James Ball: only a 12A?
18/03/2020, 19:06 - / James Ball: Just on the Saint Etienne group chat - one of the band and family have nearly all the symptoms
18/03/2020, 19:06 - / James Ball: not confirmed virus but very likely
18/03/2020, 19:07 - Paul;: There was a 3rd from work as well
18/03/2020, 19:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Did wonder this, not sure how the arguments against big government stack up now
18/03/2020, 19:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Turns out we cant just all govern ourselves without state intervention
18/03/2020, 19:09 - Paul;: Actually really shit
18/03/2020, 19:21 - Paul;: Can’t believe people give a shit about the Eurovision being cancelled
18/03/2020, 19:22 - / James Ball: Largest TV broadcast in the world?
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Who the hell is even watching it. Never known someone to announce it as a big event coming up for them
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: Must make that night free. Eurovision is on
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: “Can’t wait for Eurovision this year”
18/03/2020, 19:23 - Paul;: You never hear it
18/03/2020, 19:23 - / James Ball: I have watched but always by chance rather than choice
18/03/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: From my older brother. Tescos in Amersham
18/03/2020, 19:27 - Paul;: Ah
18/03/2020, 19:29 - / James Ball: People better not drink all the wine. Production times too long for continual production
18/03/2020, 19:30 - / James Ball: I just remembered I have a home brewing kit ready to go from my birthday
18/03/2020, 19:30 - / James Ball: 48 pints of ale
18/03/2020, 19:30 - Paul;: Get that going immediately
18/03/2020, 19:31 - / James Ball: I actually might start it tomorrow
18/03/2020, 19:31 - Phill: Me too actually
18/03/2020, 19:31 - Paul;: The brewer
18/03/2020, 19:32 - Paul;: Annoyingly you’ve used all your bottles for piss storage
18/03/2020, 19:32 - / James Ball: the baker, the shit paper taker
18/03/2020, 19:32 - / James Ball: yeah yeah. will need to acquire more bottles. I also just have a big 48 pint barrel but that requires more immediate drinking before it all goes off

18/03/2020, 19:44 - Damian Rumble: We should totally each produce a brew and bring a barrel to the next Wales. What could possibly go wrong...
18/03/2020, 19:44 - David;: Whitty
18/03/2020, 19:44 - David;: Not a charismatic figure
18/03/2020, 19:45 - David;: Lol I like the idea that have to give you tips on how alcohol might be used
18/03/2020, 19:46 - David;: I think if you've bought a home brewing kit you might have the general gist already
18/03/2020, 19:47 - David;: Should organise a Wales for one of the mad corona-free weeks
18/03/2020, 19:47 - / James Ball: Just relaxed home drinking in wales
18/03/2020, 19:47 - David;: Drink ourselves to a stupour. These will become the equivalent of the medieval peasant festivals.
18/03/2020, 19:48 - David;: When we're let out by the government for the week. Each given a ration of 1 flagon of mead
18/03/2020, 19:48 - / James Ball: Just don't drink any of the hedgerow wine at Phil's house. Last time we had that a full 2 day hangover ensued, definite methanol content
18/03/2020, 19:49 - Paul;: The hedgerow wine?
18/03/2020, 19:50 - / James Ball: a swarthy, sharp little number. Phil, Becca, Harriet and I had a bottle. Complete blackout
18/03/2020, 19:50 - Stefan;: It's the greatest cultural event of the year for me and my friends. This is devastating, equivalent to all the football tournaments being cancelled for you
18/03/2020, 19:50 - David;: Lol
18/03/2020, 19:50 - Stefan;: Gay Christmas is cancelled
18/03/2020, 19:50 - David;: Paul do you remember that wine my dad brewed that kept getting stronger and stronger
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: Yeah fortified wine it tastes like
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: Very close
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: *tasted
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: Pictures of army trucks being moved into London circulating
18/03/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: Had bits floating in it
18/03/2020, 19:51 - David;: Yeah had a real sulphur edge to it
18/03/2020, 19:52 - / James Ball: @447540496004 have you still got hedgerow left?
18/03/2020, 19:52 - David;: But would get you pissed in a couple of glasses

18/03/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: Was on my housemates phone
18/03/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: She's just gone upstairs to use all the bog roll
18/03/2020, 19:54 - Rob;: I just looked it up. At least one of the images she showed me is bollocks
18/03/2020, 19:54 - Rob;: Taken near a permanent cadet base in london
18/03/2020, 19:55 - David;: Lol
18/03/2020, 19:56 - David;: >the hedgerow wine
18/03/2020, 19:56 - David;: What were the ingredients?
18/03/2020, 19:56 - / James Ball: it was brutal
18/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: A legendary possibly mythic concoction
18/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: So a 3 day hangover?
18/03/2020, 19:58 - David;: How much was brewed and how much still remains?
18/03/2020, 19:58 - / James Ball: Becca was gone. Phil woke up and had a dominos immediately I seem to remember
18/03/2020, 19:58 - / James Ball: I could barely see
18/03/2020, 19:59 - / James Ball: I think there were a few bottles left
18/03/2020, 20:00 - / James Ball: I would guess about 20% ABV but probably some methanol content
18/03/2020, 20:01 - Phill: I drove to dominos in my pyjamas at 10AM and ate it in the car
18/03/2020, 20:01 - Phill: James was out in the garden looking at the lawn at 8am and was sick
18/03/2020, 20:02 - / James Ball: ah yeah. lol. forgot about lawn time
18/03/2020, 20:02 - Phill: We were speaking Swahili
18/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: Can’t just drop that in
18/03/2020, 20:03 - / James Ball: happened
18/03/2020, 20:03 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 20:03 - David;: Nah
18/03/2020, 20:03 - David;: Lol lawn time
18/03/2020, 20:04 - / James Ball: Just needed a good inspection at 8 before a little chunder and uncontrollable sweating
18/03/2020, 20:04 - Phill: A mad night.
18/03/2020, 20:04 - Paul;: Drinking methanol
18/03/2020, 20:06 - / James Ball: I still felt rough on the Monday, drinking was on Saturday
18/03/2020, 20:08 - David;: Reminds me of Sambos hangover in air froust one. Never left the floor of the flat. His body rejected water and all solids.
18/03/2020, 20:11 - Paul;: I do like that story
18/03/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: Sambo how was that day for you?
18/03/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Worst hangover of life. Stomach muscles in pain for a week after due to number and ferocity of vomiting sessions
18/03/2020, 21:02 - David;: I'd estimate the second day would have been the equivalent of a bad first day hangover? So the first day was a completely new level
18/03/2020, 21:11 - Sam;: Yeah. Dealing with tube was hard. I imagined it’s what it’s like to be old and infirm.
18/03/2020, 21:11 - Paul;: So you couldn’t have handled a dose of corona that morning?
18/03/2020, 21:12 - Sam;: No way.
18/03/2020, 21:14 - Paul;: Took over a week for full recovery?
18/03/2020, 21:15 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:15 - Sam;: Yeah a week
18/03/2020, 21:21 - David;: May need this
18/03/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: You'll probably end up wearing it more than any Liverpool player
18/03/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: How do they manage to take such shit quality photos of these things
18/03/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: Every time some new product leaks it’s always the worst quality
18/03/2020, 21:23 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, always getting leaked by yer nan with her Nokia 3310
18/03/2020, 21:24 - Paul;: Everyone leaking pictures inexplicably still owns the original Motorola razr
18/03/2020, 21:24 - Paul;: An Olympus 1MP digital camera
18/03/2020, 21:30 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:30 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:31 - David;: Yeah. Dem ratios
18/03/2020, 21:32 - Rob;: Although numbers of confirmed cases is basically bollocks at this point isn't it?
18/03/2020, 21:32 - David;: Could be that they are testing more
18/03/2020, 21:32 - David;: Also have a good health service.
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Phill: Got my results back today
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Rob;: If anyone was going to handle it well, you'd have said it was them
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Phill: <Media omitted>
18/03/2020, 21:33 - Rob;: Lol
18/03/2020, 21:45 - / James Ball: strong test. dominant
18/03/2020, 21:50 - Phill: Hamish why is Germany death rate so low? Lots of testing of mild cases?
18/03/2020, 22:00 - Damian Rumble: Lol
18/03/2020, 22:00 - Damian Rumble: Also lol
18/03/2020, 22:26 - David;: Everything is quite johnned
18/03/2020, 22:31 - Rob;: The football is over
18/03/2020, 22:31 - Rob;: Can't really get over that even
18/03/2020, 22:32 - Rob;: I'll never see Arsenal play FK Qarabag again
18/03/2020, 22:37 - David;: Yeah. Quite a boring apocalypse
18/03/2020, 22:37 - David;: EastEnders not a huge loss.
18/03/2020, 22:38 - David;: Couldn't have predicted this
18/03/2020, 22:38 - David;: They're forecasting US unemployment levels going close to the great depression
18/03/2020, 23:03 - Damian Rumble: That would really ruin trump. Delicious
19/03/2020, 00:16 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 07:01 - Phill: There's your vaccine just make that
19/03/2020, 07:03 - Paul;: What percentage is that?
19/03/2020, 07:16 - Rob;: Why go to the trouble of turning something invisible into something useful and intelligle, then in convert that into colourful useless noise
19/03/2020, 07:16 - Rob;: All genomes would look the same
19/03/2020, 07:17 - Paul;: Bog roll update. Garage no stock

19/03/2020, 08:19 - Phill: Lol looking back at some of these Brexit memes
19/03/2020, 08:19 - Phill: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 09:13 - David;: Why is coronavirus a 16-bit SNES game?
19/03/2020, 09:16 - Paul;: Can you even do anything with this?
19/03/2020, 09:16 - Rob;: No it's pointless
19/03/2020, 09:16 - Rob;: They've taken the information and scrambled it
19/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: The full genome in AUGC neclotides is amazingly useful. This isn't
19/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: Bit like converting all the letters in the Hamlet to colours
19/03/2020, 09:17 - Rob;: Cool, but why?
19/03/2020, 09:19 - Paul;: To create a vaccine for hamlet?
19/03/2020, 09:23 - David;: This man's got pork to rent.
19/03/2020, 09:24 - David;: How do you even procrastinate effectively without endless football gossip and fantasy football?
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Football manager 2020 is free for the next week
19/03/2020, 09:24 - David;: Ah.
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Rob;: No
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Rob;: They haven't
19/03/2020, 09:24 - Rob;: Fuck
19/03/2020, 09:25 - David;: Nah
19/03/2020, 09:25 - David;: I could have just one drink. Just this once.
19/03/2020, 09:39 - Rob;: Imagine self-quaretining with your partner, but they're gripped by an intense FM addiction
19/03/2020, 09:39 - Rob;: Your only company can't pull away from Notts County's 2027/28 transfer window
19/03/2020, 09:41 - Rob;: Would a great troll if FM 2020 just simulated the lockdown
19/03/2020, 09:43 - Phill: Lol I'm getting it
19/03/2020, 09:43 - Phill: Is there online? Should we do an online season?
19/03/2020, 09:43 - Phill: Against each other
19/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: Yeah it's just all the nucleotides in order represented as colours. Just interesting that all of this is caused by just under 8Kb of data
19/03/2020, 10:01 - Hamish Sinclair: You will all have bought it within a week
19/03/2020, 11:37 - David;: Hamish how difficult would it be to do wartime-style conscription for the NHS to help manage the pressure. Train civilians to do basic corona-specific procedures or testing.
19/03/2020, 11:38 - David;: Take the pressure off.
19/03/2020, 11:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Reckon your best bet would be maximising everything you can do to keep existing staff at work (help with childcare,  test nhs family member to prevent periods of self isolation etc)
19/03/2020, 11:41 - Hamish Sinclair: While simultaneously training existing medical staff in covid relevant skills
19/03/2020, 11:42 - Rob;: Could nurseries be made to stay open for keyworker children? Most seem to be closing. My sister's one is charging 80% fees even though they're offering no care
19/03/2020, 11:42 - Hamish Sinclair: They're considering letting nhs staff stay I  hotels if they have someone at home unwell to allow them to continue working
19/03/2020, 11:42 - Hamish Sinclair: That's outrageous
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Hamish Sinclair: The difficulty with childcare is you need to also isolate grandparents etc
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Hamish Sinclair: So most people have lost their backup plan
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Rob;: Obviously they can cancel, the threat is that they lose their place and when things return to normal you don't have childcare
19/03/2020, 11:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah sounds like they are being massive pricks about that
19/03/2020, 11:45 - Rob;: Seems like there will be a lot of jobless people soon who could be brought in to do something somewhere
19/03/2020, 11:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah. We have all be warned that there could be a situation where frontline staff are effectively socially excluded as they will have high rates if infection and will be continuing to work/travel
19/03/2020, 11:47 - Hamish Sinclair: A infected undercllass
19/03/2020, 11:47 - / James Ball: You get the jobless swabbing for covid though and surely it devalues the results somewhat? Can be less sure of quality of data
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Stabbing not difficult tbf
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Swabbing
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Rob;: Yet also put greatest hope
19/03/2020, 11:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah lol. Everyone fully reliant yet scared to be around
19/03/2020, 11:49 - / James Ball: I agree but also underclass potentially got able to bash two rocks together
19/03/2020, 11:49 - / James Ball: Not*
19/03/2020, 11:50 - Hamish Sinclair: The underclass are the healthcare workers
19/03/2020, 11:51 - / James Ball: Ah
19/03/2020, 11:52 - / James Ball: Many metaphors going on here
19/03/2020, 11:54 - David;: You'll get the status of national heroes like the RAF though. Could be worse. Milk that for decades
19/03/2020, 11:54 - Rob;: As a generation we can milk the fuck out of this
19/03/2020, 11:55 - Rob;: And all the people born around now can in 60 years pretend they lived through it too and vote for some weird Brexit like thing because of it
19/03/2020, 11:57 - Sam;: we've got loads to harp on about; financial crisis, climate change, brexit. now this.
19/03/2020, 11:58 - Rob;: And crucially we won't be wealthy when old
19/03/2020, 11:59 - Rob;: Although perhaps the younger gens will just be even more fucked so they'll hate us anyway
19/03/2020, 11:59 - Sam;: yeah. they'll think we had it good compared to them and we'll be hated like boomers.
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: Yeah we can now be those cunts
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: In 60 years time
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: We'll ironically be simultaneously snowflakes and a blitz spirit generation.
19/03/2020, 12:02 - David;: You rarely see that combo
19/03/2020, 12:04 - / James Ball: You whippersnappers never had it so tough as the winter of '20. Ocado stopped deliveries and we all had to stay indoors
19/03/2020, 12:07 - David;: Yeah that's the issue. The main practical consequence is sitting on our arse indoors. Harder to milk that.
19/03/2020, 12:08 - David;: Need some good generational PR on this to be full cunts about it
19/03/2020, 12:10 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 12:19 - Damian Rumble: My housemate just got sent home for having a persistent cough. We're fucked
19/03/2020, 12:20 - Paul;: 14 day isolation for you. Make sure you stick to it
19/03/2020, 12:20 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 12:24 - David;: Going to pub tonight then?
19/03/2020, 12:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Why the fuck was he in work?
19/03/2020, 12:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah you've just bought yourself some sweet self isolation
19/03/2020, 12:25 - / James Ball: This. No one allowed in or out Damo
19/03/2020, 12:26 - Paul;: I know you struggle to understand the concept of infecting at risk people but you’ve got to stick to it
19/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: You're likely infected as well, as they will have been asymptomatic for days
19/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: Just bed in
19/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: Could be a good time to drop acid. Could go either way.
19/03/2020, 12:32 - / James Ball: Covid hallucination could be strong
19/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Yeah, watch Channel 4 in-depth news on acid safe in the knowledge you might have it
19/03/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: See no issues there
19/03/2020, 12:34 - David;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 12:34 - David;: These are excellent by the way
19/03/2020, 12:34 - David;: 10/10
19/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: China now has no new domestic cases.
19/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: They really nipped that in the bud
19/03/2020, 12:38 - Rob;: I was thinking about how their enormous size helped them there. Could quarantine an are the size of most countries but keep some economy going during
19/03/2020, 12:38 - Rob;: If the US had quarantined after first cases they might have been able to do the same
19/03/2020, 12:39 - Rob;: Also with it originating there they didn't initially have to deal with it being imported over the whole country from outside, so they could focus
19/03/2020, 12:40 - David;: Shouldn't they make things worse? It all being concentrated in one place overwhelming it vs having it more evenly spread.
19/03/2020, 12:40 - David;: That's why Italy has been so fucked
19/03/2020, 12:41 - Rob;: Yeah, fucks that region, but in terms of a quarantine working and not fucking your economy absolutely it was perhaps an advantage
19/03/2020, 12:42 - Rob;: Italy got all it's cased from people randomly flying into different places, China new almost all of its were in Wuhan
19/03/2020, 12:42 - Rob;: *its, cases, knew, etc
19/03/2020, 13:05 - / James Ball: @447854020575 do you have pneumonia yet?
19/03/2020, 13:05 - / James Ball: Need temp chart to track your fever
19/03/2020, 13:06 - Paul;: Oh yeah chart your temperature for us
19/03/2020, 13:06 - Paul;: At least 3 readings a day
19/03/2020, 13:06 - Paul;: See the trends
19/03/2020, 13:08 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 13:08 - Damian Rumble: She is a mental health support worker so she has had to spend her time out in the community visiting sick people. It was inevitable she would get ill
19/03/2020, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: Though tbh I have only spent 5 mins of time with her with the last 5 or 6 days
19/03/2020, 13:09 - Damian Rumble: @447526575752  what is the come up time? From infection to showing symptoms
19/03/2020, 13:10 - Paul;: You still have to isolate for 14 days
19/03/2020, 13:10 - Damian Rumble: To make matters work I changed internet provider and the new box was supposed to come today, only the pick couldn't be fucked to ring the doorbell and just left us a red letter. So now I have to go out and pick it up tomorrow or face two weeks with no internet
19/03/2020, 13:11 - Paul;: I know you’re trying to weasel your way out of it
19/03/2020, 13:11 - Paul;: Get someone to get it for you
19/03/2020, 13:12 - / James Ball: No you don't. You are not allowed to leave Damo!
19/03/2020, 13:12 - / James Ball: I have no internet
19/03/2020, 13:12 - / James Ball: You can arrange a redeliver if it's royal mail
19/03/2020, 13:13 - / James Ball: Redeliver. Can't risk key royal mail workers for Damo's new router
19/03/2020, 13:28 - Paul;: <Media omitted>

19/03/2020, 13:45 - Rob;: Thank you SgtDavid
19/03/2020, 13:45 - Jack G;: The best part was the really small trolly reply after I’d asked you to stop
19/03/2020, 13:45 - Jack G;: Somehow that happened
19/03/2020, 13:46 - David;: Could have chosen much worse threads for that to happen in
19/03/2020, 13:46 - Stefan;: Yeah a very pleasing regular pattern

19/03/2020, 14:08 - / James Ball: > only paying attention when you are at risk
19/03/2020, 14:08 - / James Ball: various studies on incubation time
19/03/2020, 14:09 - / James Ball: as low as 2 days as high as 29 days in one isolated case. I think median time is 6.2 days or something
19/03/2020, 14:48 - David;: I find the BBC coverage quite shit
19/03/2020, 14:49 - David;: Just vox pops of how Deidre in Hampshire is coping.
19/03/2020, 14:49 - David;: Doesn't give the global picture well at all
19/03/2020, 14:49 - Paul;: Yeah hate that shit
19/03/2020, 14:56 - / James Ball: BBC coverage is shit for most things now, CNN a bit more shouty but quite balanced for an American platform
19/03/2020, 14:56 - / James Ball: writing is better, they use full sentences and everything is not in quotes
19/03/2020, 16:37 - Paul;: Toilet roll just stocked in coop. Can only buy one pack (Jack)
19/03/2020, 16:41 - Jack G;: I’ve never bought more than one pack of toilet paper in my life
19/03/2020, 16:42 - Paul;: Lol
19/03/2020, 16:44 - Jack G;: Buying one pack of 24 perfectly legal as far as I can tell
19/03/2020, 16:53 - David;: Will be good to watch some Chinese super league when that gets going again. Now they're corona free
19/03/2020, 16:53 - David;: They might get huge ratings
19/03/2020, 16:53 - Paul;: All top players transfer to China?
19/03/2020, 16:53 - Paul;: Messi playing for Wuhan FC
19/03/2020, 16:54 - David;: Better playing at Wuhan than quarantined in Barceona
19/03/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: British clubs could just buy stadiums over there
19/03/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: Have a two week quarantine training camp then away they go
19/03/2020, 16:58 - Rob;: Wuhan Wanderers
19/03/2020, 16:59 - Rob;: Hebei Hotspurs
19/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Paulinho now plays for Hebei
19/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: former spurs player no less

19/03/2020, 17:29 - Paul;: Next.
19/03/2020, 17:41 - David;: The little gnome they have doing the signing on this one
19/03/2020, 17:43 - Paul;: Rate whitty
19/03/2020, 17:43 - Damian Rumble: I really wish I had photographic evidence from the two years we lived together to challenge this...
19/03/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: Ah jack
19/03/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: Toilet roll hoarding and multiple pack buying
19/03/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: Your PR campaign against the bog roll comes unstuck again
19/03/2020, 17:52 - / James Ball: can we get an antibody test to determine if someone has hoarded bog roll before
19/03/2020, 17:53 - Rob;: Oh yes, that's being fast-tracked as we speak
19/03/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: Jack is full of bog roll lies. Lie after lie
19/03/2020, 17:54 - David;: So Jack you in fact buy multiple packs
19/03/2020, 17:54 - David;: and of huge size
19/03/2020, 17:54 - Paul;: The damning lies always exposed
19/03/2020, 17:55 - Jack G;: Everyone just instantly believing Damian? He’s full of shit. This is the first time I’ve ever bought a 24 pack
19/03/2020, 17:56 - Rob;: 'I bought multiple packs but I didn't inhale'
19/03/2020, 17:57 - Paul;: Stories changed to now only ever 1 x 24 pack. All the times you were out buying 6 x 4 packs. Shameful
19/03/2020, 17:58 - Jack G;: Not listening to this anymore. Not accepting anymore questions about bog roll, sorry
19/03/2020, 18:11 - Damian Rumble: I'm pretty sure I say here that I don't have evidence of jack's hording so he's probably right on that one
19/03/2020, 18:11 - / James Ball: you have no evidence *of the hoarding*
19/03/2020, 18:12 - / James Ball: hoarding confirmed
19/03/2020, 18:12 - Paul;: That’s the way you would read that
19/03/2020, 18:20 - / James Ball: I see no other way to read it
19/03/2020, 18:26 - David;: Yeah, there was hoarding that you didn't record
19/03/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: really been thrown under the bus there jack.
19/03/2020, 18:27 - / James Ball: have you got an evidence to contrary?
19/03/2020, 18:27 - Jack G;: What is this, a witch hunt? What happened to innocent until proven guilty
19/03/2020, 18:27 - David;: Like saying 'I wish I had evidence of that time you shat yourself.' 'No, no, of course I wasn't saying that you did shit yourself, just that I wish I had evidence of a hypothetical time when you had'
19/03/2020, 18:28 - Jack G;: As if I would have enough cash to stockpile bog roll as a stupid. More interested in crates of Stella
19/03/2020, 18:28 - Jack G;: Student*
19/03/2020, 18:29 - David;: 'I wish I had kept the blood stained clothes from the day I murdered that woman'; 'What I meant by that was, if I had commited the murder, then I would have kept evidence of it, your honour'
19/03/2020, 18:30 - / James Ball: pretty much, yeah
19/03/2020, 18:30 - / James Ball: important to root out the hoarders among us and then test them to see if they are hoarders any more or if they have repented
19/03/2020, 18:31 - David;: Bog roll restocked now anyway. So you're sitting on 31 rolls for no reason
19/03/2020, 18:31 - Jack G;: Yeah because I’m not planning on ever taking a shit again
19/03/2020, 18:32 - David;: You panicked
19/03/2020, 18:32 - / James Ball: maybe in July you'll need a restock
19/03/2020, 18:33 - Damian Rumble: This is largely the assumption I was operating under. I would have loved to have thrown jack under a bus by providing photos of him clutching at bog roll as it falls from inside his room.... But alas I am unable to (because it didn't happen)
19/03/2020, 18:37 - David;: How many rolls have you used since you stocked up?
19/03/2020, 18:38 - Paul;: Lol hypothetically wishing for evidence
19/03/2020, 18:39 - Jack G;: 1
19/03/2020, 18:39 - Paul;: How many did you think you’d have got through?
19/03/2020, 18:40 - Jack G;: 1 or 2
19/03/2020, 18:45 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 18:46 - Rob;: Less than a pound per person though
19/03/2020, 18:46 - / James Ball: a whole cupboard of children's medicine I bet
19/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Because jack has it all
19/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Hence hoarders
19/03/2020, 18:47 - / James Ball: yes a very non sensational sensational headline
19/03/2020, 18:47 - Paul;: >what is hoarding
19/03/2020, 18:51 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 18:54 - / James Ball: rinse nob
19/03/2020, 18:56 - Rob;: I'm partly so jealous of the type of quarantine where you don't have to work. All that wanking I'm missing out on
19/03/2020, 18:56 - Rob;: But also grateful for this ever more perilous employment
19/03/2020, 18:59 - / James Ball: why not  both?
19/03/2020, 19:18 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
19/03/2020, 19:20 - Paul;: Lol she’s done well there
19/03/2020, 19:21 - / James Ball: this is you Damo
19/03/2020, 19:21 - Damian Rumble: Well if you infect a whole plane of people what's another 500 going to hurt
19/03/2020, 19:21 - Paul;: 100%
19/03/2020, 19:22 - / James Ball: how's the quarantine going damo? is Boris going to have to enforce lock down because of people flouting the rules?
19/03/2020, 19:23 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure you could refer to me as a socialite
19/03/2020, 19:23 - Damian Rumble: No one is buying that
19/03/2020, 19:54 - / James Ball: So Italy dead then. Worse outbreak than China by some metrics and people still not in total lockdown
19/03/2020, 19:56 - Paul;: Anyone watched tales from earthsea?
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: I read ally he earthsea books as a kid
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: Assuming it's the same
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: Ursula le Guin is a great writer
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: Her adult books are great
19/03/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: What's Tales from... on?
19/03/2020, 20:03 - Paul;: Shitflix. Studio ghibli one
19/03/2020, 20:03 - Paul;: Could be huge
19/03/2020, 20:15 - Rob;: Ah. Well. Combining two awesome things.

19/03/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: So perhaps it will slack off
19/03/2020, 22:26 - Paul;: Good point

20/03/2020, 00:12 - Damian Rumble: Surely that's reflective on the time it took to move from China (who quarantined an entire city to stop in spreading) to densely populated Europe (where Boris advised us not to go to the pub)
20/03/2020, 06:32 - Phill: And everyone went anyway. Can't blame everything on a Tory.
20/03/2020, 07:08 - Phill: Could we farm and harvest antibodies from people who have recovered and pump them into everyone?

20/03/2020, 09:21 - Damian Rumble: I thought 'critical' workforce's children could keep going to school?
20/03/2020, 09:23 - Rob;: And schools are meant to still be running today. So I guess it's schools that have shut on their own terms
20/03/2020, 09:23 - Rob;: Which anecdotally is most of them. Every teacher I know has been off since at least weds
20/03/2020, 09:25 - Damian Rumble: So my flatmate who probably has the virus. Her boyfriend came over last night and he left to go to work this morning (he's a sound technician at a uni). I did point out that he should be quarantine but he went anyway
20/03/2020, 09:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Hes an idiot
20/03/2020, 09:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Nursaries
20/03/2020, 09:25 - Damian Rumble: He was like "there's basically no one at work or on the tube"

20/03/2020, 12:39 - David;: This is what you've done Jack.
20/03/2020, 12:47 - Jack G;: Complete bs how people are buying multiple kgs of food, honestly they need to start putting restrictions in place formally where you can’t buy more than x amount of anything
20/03/2020, 12:48 - David;: What would the bog roll limit be?
20/03/2020, 12:48 - Paul;: Otherwise you’re unable to control yourself without imposed restrictions?
20/03/2020, 12:48 - Jack G;: I hardly think I’m anywhere near the worst offender, I buy one fucking pack of bog roll and now I’m Satan?
20/03/2020, 12:50 - / James Ball: 🧻👺🧻
20/03/2020, 12:50 - David;: So you'd set a bog roll restriction higher than 24 rolls presumably

20/03/2020, 13:24 - Damian Rumble: I've had the chat muted for the last 4 years and can confirm it does notify you when you are tagged
20/03/2020, 13:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
20/03/2020, 13:42 - David;: Question for James. I managed to stand on the left side of this jack while it was plugged in, with I believe the outside of the broke jack now lodged inside the 'A' input. Any thoughts on how one might resolve such a situation?
20/03/2020, 13:43 - David;: *broken
20/03/2020, 13:53 - Phill: Super glue a stick to the bit stuck in there and pull it out. Buy new cable.
20/03/2020, 13:59 - David;: Got a replacement cable. Yeah - do I want to be lobbing super glue into an electrical socket?
20/03/2020, 14:04 - Sam;: SAGE documents out
20/03/2020, 14:04 - Sam;: Social distancing for rest of year advised
20/03/2020, 14:09 - / James Ball: Yes, this does happen quite regularly. The superglue trick might work but you'd need to use a very small amount to avoid splooging it all over the inside and ending up super gluing the broken end in there.
20/03/2020, 14:11 - / James Ball: The only real surefire way of fixing it is to poke it out from the other side or use a very long thin pair of pliers to try and grab the broken jack
20/03/2020, 14:13 - David;: The outside of the socket seems like it would unscrew
20/03/2020, 14:13 - David;: But do I want to be doing that?
20/03/2020, 14:14 - Rob;: But with some alternating of strict measures (like now) and less so (like last week). So we still get our mega benders
20/03/2020, 14:14 - Paul;: The mega benders
20/03/2020, 14:15 - Sam;: Alternating frousts
20/03/2020, 14:15 - Rob;: Like being Demob happy during the war
20/03/2020, 14:16 - Rob;: Get pissed and catch syphilis off an underage French prozzer
20/03/2020, 14:19 - David;: So the 12 weeks was a load of bollocks
20/03/2020, 14:20 - Rob;: Probably 12 weeks for strict measures before alternating?
20/03/2020, 14:20 - Rob;: No one fucking knows anyway, all prediction
20/03/2020, 14:21 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
20/03/2020, 14:23 - David;: How does the poking technique work?
20/03/2020, 14:32 - / James Ball: Usually they aren't covered inside and you can just poke the jack out with something
20/03/2020, 15:18 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
20/03/2020, 15:18 - Rob;: So 1800s
20/03/2020, 15:18 - / James Ball: thumb update. one of my stitches came undone when washing my hands. Just had an early extraction
20/03/2020, 15:25 - David;: Bonus content
20/03/2020, 15:32 - Sam;: We’re about to do our final bit of panic buying; gin and tonic
20/03/2020, 15:37 - / James Ball: two cases worth, yeah?
20/03/2020, 15:49 - Damian Rumble: Eagerly awaiting the thumb review...
20/03/2020, 16:06 - Sam;: Everything limited to four items. Was allowed 4 1litre gins but only 4 750ml tonics.
20/03/2020, 16:07 - / James Ball: actually hoarding
20/03/2020, 16:08 - Rob;: They're actually suggesting you mix less there
20/03/2020, 16:18 - Paul;: So teachers will just be awarding grades for this year
20/03/2020, 16:22 - Sam;: They want me more pissed
20/03/2020, 16:35 - David;: Lol incentivising incredibly short strong drinking
20/03/2020, 16:36 - David;: Would be great if they took that to extremes. 4 grains of rice or 4 pineapples.
20/03/2020, 16:50 - Damian Rumble: That sounds excessive but then one report I read today suggested we might have to keep these measures for the rest of the year so it case you'll struggle
20/03/2020, 16:55 - Sam;: I’m going back tomorrow.
20/03/2020, 16:56 - Rob;: But get it in the same ratio again
20/03/2020, 17:15 - Damian Rumble: Government paying 80% of salaries of people who would overwise lose their jobs
20/03/2020, 17:15 - Damian Rumble: Not sure if that covers freelance like @447508112753
20/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: doubt it as I don't have a salary
20/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: no way to prove lost earnings
20/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: although they are very happy to tax me based on previous years earnings and then correct it at the end
20/03/2020, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: No VAT for the next quarter
20/03/2020, 17:17 - Damian Rumble: Paul did you write this economic policy
20/03/2020, 17:19 - Damian Rumble: Universal credit goes up by £1000 per year.
20/03/2020, 17:19 - Damian Rumble: There you go
20/03/2020, 17:21 - / James Ball: must be able to claim UC to get it though
20/03/2020, 17:23 - / James Ball: Economy basically dead after this then
20/03/2020, 17:25 - Damian Rumble: They said something about opening up universal credit to all, but I don't know enough about that system to judge whether it would help or not
20/03/2020, 17:25 - Sam;: You can get SSP. £100 a week
20/03/2020, 17:26 - Sam;: It’s something I guess
20/03/2020, 17:26 - Damian Rumble: But yeah... Given this could be the case for the rest of the year there is going to be some hefty debt after this
20/03/2020, 17:31 - / James Ball: 50% of GDP extra?
20/03/2020, 17:38 - Paul;: Think we still need that £1k direct
20/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: That would add much more confidence
20/03/2020, 17:41 - / James Ball: £1 available now though
20/03/2020, 17:41 - / James Ball: just not as a cheque
20/03/2020, 17:41 - / James Ball: £1k*
20/03/2020, 17:42 - Phill: Tfw we all get knighted

20/03/2020, 18:19 - Phill: Everyone just sitting at home now taking 80% of their salary? What's there to riot about?

20/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: The big shut down of everything
20/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Will be wfh for months
20/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Which might actually be quite good
20/03/2020, 18:55 - / James Ball: there will never be full lockdown as they need to keep deliveries, food, manufacturing, healthcare etc going
20/03/2020, 19:00 - Paul;: Apart from those essentials but like in Spain / Italy where you’re not allowed out
20/03/2020, 19:06 - David;: Don't think so they ruled that out yesterday
20/03/2020, 19:07 - David;: Think it will stay like this
20/03/2020, 19:07 - Paul;: Ah ok. This could be manageable
20/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: Just went for a wander in Edinburgh. People still in some pubs.
20/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: Not great enforcement
20/03/2020, 19:08 - / James Ball: yeah, they'll keep it like this until they need to enforce it
20/03/2020, 19:09 - / James Ball: last drink of the apocalypse
20/03/2020, 19:09 - / James Ball: lots of beer going to waste over this
20/03/2020, 19:10 - David;: Should flog it by the barrell. We could all get huge kegs in to tide us through
20/03/2020, 19:10 - / James Ball: having worked in pubs it will literally just go down the drain if it's not drunk
20/03/2020, 19:11 - David;: Or just serve it takeaway in plastic cups
20/03/2020, 19:11 - David;: Festival style
20/03/2020, 19:11 - / James Ball: this would be the best
20/03/2020, 19:12 - David;: Knock down prices to shift it. Could be great

20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: 15mins to go
20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: Consuming every track.
20/03/2020, 22:27 - Phill: This is the first significant resistance.
20/03/2020, 22:28 - David;: Nice. Shuffle or original order?
20/03/2020, 22:28 - Phill: Original order
20/03/2020, 22:28 - David;: This is a huge idea.
20/03/2020, 22:28 - Phill: Analysing the composition
20/03/2020, 22:28 - David;: How can that be the track she dislikes in all that? A classic
20/03/2020, 22:29 - David;: There are some much more obscure c.2014 indie b sides on honkington she could legit oppose
20/03/2020, 22:29 - David;: E.e. Peng pong by Erlend Oye
20/03/2020, 22:31 - Phill: But that's the kind of indie/hipster shit that she loves
20/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: She's already noted a paradigm shift from the guitar to the synth.
20/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: Over the years.
20/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: I feel this exercise will bring that sharply into focus.
20/03/2020, 22:33 - David;: Yeah, that's the central drift

21/03/2020, 01:41 - Damian Rumble: BBC News - Coronavirus: Dow erases Trump presidency gains
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51980671
21/03/2020, 08:32 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 08:37 - Rob;: But also not factoring in how many extra people would die of non-corona causes due to less care if corona completely overwhelms the nhs
21/03/2020, 08:38 - Rob;: And it's quite a cold way of looking at it too. When a relative has a year to live, their family don't just go 'well, fuck it then, kill em now'
21/03/2020, 08:57 - Damian Rumble: I think the do nothing model had 500k deaths but I highly doubt that number is purely Coronavirus deaths. @447526575752 of the cases you see. What percentage of victims have serious health conditions that may have resulted in them dying within the year any way?
21/03/2020, 09:00 - Hamish Sinclair: I think alot of non Corona virus deaths will be accelerated. We are stopping giving most people chemotherapy for non curable conditions so you would expect cancer survival statistics to be much higher in the next 6months
21/03/2020, 09:19 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I guess the problem is that all those yearly deaths are coming at the same time rather than spread throughout the year.
21/03/2020, 09:34 - David;: That's quite an oversight
21/03/2020, 09:38 - Paul;: You’d have thought you’d want that mapped in
21/03/2020, 09:39 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm not sure the biggest concern about Coronavirus is necessarily the mortality rate of the virus itself. We are already resigned to the fact that 80% will get it
21/03/2020, 09:40 - Hamish Sinclair: The biggest concern is is overwhelms health  systems and then the mortality rate of Coronavirus and other conditions will rise exponentially
21/03/2020, 09:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Your chance of surviving a major car accident for example is much lower if all the operating theatres are full of covid patients on ventilators and the surgeon is at home I'll with symptoms
21/03/2020, 09:42 - Hamish Sinclair: Possibly yes, front loading your normal annual deaths, but by doing so increase the mortality of every other condition
21/03/2020, 09:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Also current mortality rate of inpatient covid admissions over 70years of age is 100% (albeit small numbers at this time)
21/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: But then I was thinking you need to map all the deaths directly or indirectly caused by the interventions. Suicides, obesity from no one doing excercise etc.
21/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: Ah. What? Everyone over 70 admitted to hospital has died?
21/03/2020, 09:46 - David;: People probably drinking a lot more booze. Hence liver problems down the line
21/03/2020, 09:51 - David;: And, the deaths in the years to come from the economic effect of the interventions. Directly: less funding for the NHS next decade as we have a smaller tax base. Indirectly: people poorer and/or unemployed so eat less healthily, excercise less, mental health problems etc.
21/03/2020, 09:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Who has tested positive with covid. Small numbers n<20 from frimley park
21/03/2020, 10:22 - Phill: Thanks for the card samboo
21/03/2020, 10:28 - David;: Wait but I thought almost all of the c150 deaths from it have been over 70?
21/03/2020, 10:28 - Phill: I think he means at his specific hospital
21/03/2020, 10:29 - David;: Right. Yeah
21/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: Fuck. c.1,500 people died yesterday worldwide
21/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: From 10,000 to 11,509 in a day
21/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: *11,500
21/03/2020, 10:39 - / James Ball: but we are seeing the death wave from everyone who got sick 5 days ago
21/03/2020, 10:40 - / James Ball: with luck cases should level off in a few days once the impact of the social distancing is felt, however deaths will continue to climb in the interim
21/03/2020, 10:42 - Rob;: When did Italy lock down? Was it 2 weeks ago? Deaths per day still increasing
21/03/2020, 10:43 - / James Ball: 12th March?
21/03/2020, 10:43 - Phill: Yeah but they've all been slobbering over each other. Kissing to greet, not respecting personal space etc. Classic Italians. British are more socially distant by nature.
21/03/2020, 10:44 - Paul;: Think this does have a lot to do with it
21/03/2020, 10:44 - Paul;: More than people are appreciating
21/03/2020, 10:45 - / James Ball: Yeah it has a lot to do with it, Italians not sticking to their quarantine and a generally older population
21/03/2020, 10:46 - / James Ball: we shouldn't be complacent though as there've been plenty of people going into work for a long time that carrying it
21/03/2020, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Hospitals are preparing for surge in cases nationally within 2 weeks
21/03/2020, 10:47 - Hamish Sinclair: London disproportionately affected at the moment
21/03/2020, 10:55 - Stefan;: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-18/99-of-those-who-died-from-virus-had-other-illness-italy-says
The average age of deaths in Italy is 80, and virtually all had underlying conditions
21/03/2020, 10:56 - Stefan;: Seems they're particularly fucked with a very old population and multi-generational households the norm, so young people catch it and then pass it to grandparents
21/03/2020, 10:58 - David;: Yes, that social structure with extended family homes is fucking them
21/03/2020, 11:00 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 11:00 - David;: Not really squashing the sombrero
21/03/2020, 11:01 - Hamish Sinclair: Would be interesting to see that curve by region. My understanding is that london is outstripping the rest of the country, partly due to population density but also through lack of adherence to social distencing
21/03/2020, 11:03 - David;: Yeah - well that graph is globally as well not even UK
21/03/2020, 11:03 - David;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 11:03 - David;: This is UK
21/03/2020, 11:08 - Damian Rumble: This issue very useful
21/03/2020, 11:11 - Damian Rumble: Is*
21/03/2020, 11:12 - Damian Rumble: So basically the answer here is 99%
21/03/2020, 11:16 - Hamish Sinclair: No not neccesarily
21/03/2020, 11:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Alot of the people who have died had underlying diabetes, heart disease etc, but would not neccesarily a year from death
21/03/2020, 11:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah, just found out someone I saw yesterday has tested positive, it's only a matter of time now
21/03/2020, 11:20 - / James Ball: Shit, self isolation now?
21/03/2020, 11:22 - Hamish Sinclair: No, carry on until develop symptoms
21/03/2020, 11:22 - Paul;: Then 7 or 14 days isolation?
21/03/2020, 11:23 - Hamish Sinclair: I'll need to see what the up to date guidance is
21/03/2020, 11:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Changes daily it seems
21/03/2020, 11:23 - David;: That seems fucked. Won't you just be transmitting to other NHS workers in the meantime?
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Possibly
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: If I'm infected
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: But I might not be
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: And if you tested me now and it was negative then it might be false
21/03/2020, 11:24 - David;: How quickly can you get tested now?
21/03/2020, 11:24 - Hamish Sinclair: As all virus have an incubation period
21/03/2020, 11:25 - Hamish Sinclair: I wont be able to get tested unless I need hospital admission
21/03/2020, 11:25 - David;: Ah.
21/03/2020, 11:25 - Hamish Sinclair: But trusts are arguing with the government that we need to
21/03/2020, 11:25 - David;: So you have to develop symptoms to be isolated now
21/03/2020, 11:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, or live with someone with symptoms
21/03/2020, 11:25 - David;: Yeah this seems like a not great situation.
21/03/2020, 11:26 - David;: It will be going around the NHS quickly with people who haven't been tested and currently asymptomatic
21/03/2020, 11:26 - David;: I suppose if the NHS can develop its own mini herd immunity before the rest of the country that could be okay?
21/03/2020, 11:27 - Paul;: The nhs herd
21/03/2020, 11:28 - / James Ball: The segregation of health and state
21/03/2020, 11:29 - Hamish Sinclair: The social pariahs
21/03/2020, 11:30 - / James Ball: we probably owe Hamish a pint after this
21/03/2020, 11:31 - Hamish Sinclair: I believe phil has a surplus currently
21/03/2020, 11:33 - David;: Is work noticeably busier already or is it just the sense of a shit storm coming
21/03/2020, 11:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Weirdly emptied out a bit as all consultation have moved to telephone a d people are staying away
21/03/2020, 11:35 - Hamish Sinclair: And then within the designated covid isolated areas its carnage
21/03/2020, 11:35 - David;: Are you away from that?
21/03/2020, 11:35 - Hamish Sinclair: But majority of the cases within that are suspected, bot confirmed
21/03/2020, 11:36 - Hamish Sinclair: So dont think we have actually had the proper surge in cases yet, we are just putting everyone who would have otherwise come I  with a pneumonia in one place
21/03/2020, 11:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes but have to see cancer patients admitted to those areas
21/03/2020, 11:56 - / James Ball: gumped a lot of stilton last night. paying for it now
21/03/2020, 11:56 - Paul;: The gout
21/03/2020, 11:56 - / James Ball: large amount of stilton gas emerging
21/03/2020, 11:57 - / James Ball: beef stew with dumplings, spring greens, wine, beer, stilton. Gout inevitable
21/03/2020, 12:06 - David;: Ah yeah. The cut load on that is weighty
21/03/2020, 12:06 - David;: *gut
21/03/2020, 12:06 - David;: Lot of bowel admin there
21/03/2020, 12:07 - David;: Have we thought about all the extra gout deaths from self-isolation frousts?
21/03/2020, 12:27 - David;: I feel like deliveroo drivers have suddenly become key workers
21/03/2020, 12:33 - Paul;: New movie releases now available on Amazon by the looks of it
21/03/2020, 12:34 - Paul;: Seeing as can’t watch in the cinema
21/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: Yeah saw that they are doing streaming releases of new films
21/03/2020, 12:49 - / James Ball: I wonder if that will stick after the current apocalypse

21/03/2020, 15:52 - David;: So actually being used as hard currency now. Bog rolls for beer exchange rate
21/03/2020, 15:52 - Phill: >selling scarce items
21/03/2020, 15:53 - David;: I also loled at that. 'its about keeping our staff busy'. Bet they fucking love that. This makes us no money we're just so spiteful that we can't bear to simply give you the time off.
21/03/2020, 15:54 - David;: I'd rather you sold our dwindling shitty stock at no profit to us than give you some extra leisure time.
21/03/2020, 15:57 - Phill: @jack how many pints of roll you got left now?
21/03/2020, 15:58 - Jack G;: 29 pints going by this exchange rate?
21/03/2020, 16:40 - David;: Was thinking we could synchronise re-watch withnail and I at some point. Start at the same time. Drink when withnail drinks.
21/03/2020, 16:41 - Phill: Yeah yeah yeah

21/03/2020, 17:07 - Paul;: 800 more dead in Italy past 24 hrs
21/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: Yep. Ivan only smell malt now
21/03/2020, 17:11 - David;: Old Malty
21/03/2020, 17:20 - / James Ball: I can*
21/03/2020, 17:20 - / James Ball: Woodfordes Wherry is the beer
21/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: What do you have to do
21/03/2020, 17:35 - David;: Is it just a yeast/hop mix you add water to?
21/03/2020, 17:37 - / James Ball: I wasn't sure but essentially it came with two massive cans of molasses type malt
21/03/2020, 17:37 - / James Ball: mixed it all into the water after sterilising and added yeast
21/03/2020, 17:38 - David;: Will it get stronger the longer you leave it?
21/03/2020, 17:38 - / James Ball: nah it will run out of energy
21/03/2020, 17:39 - David;: How long till you can drink?
21/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: theoretically two weeks but will probably leave for a bit to mature in the big cask
21/03/2020, 17:42 - / James Ball: should end up being a malty dark ale
21/03/2020, 17:44 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 17:44 - / James Ball: Just squatting in the bathroom stirring my beer bucket
21/03/2020, 17:45 - David;: Have you considered taking up pipe smoking?
21/03/2020, 17:54 - Rob;: I walked to my office to pick up some stuff before it closes indefinitely today. Zone 2 London is really lively, no one in pubs but lot of people out on walks keeping their distance. Changes dramatically as soon as you get into zone 1. Absolute ghost town there, except for the homeless people, who are getting really desperate
21/03/2020, 17:55 - Rob;: They've basically had their support network of workers and tourists cut off completely
21/03/2020, 17:56 - David;: Yeah. They will have to migrate out to residential districts? Rely on walkers.
21/03/2020, 17:57 - Stefan;: We cycled through Hackney/Walthamstow marshes and it was full of people
21/03/2020, 17:57 - Stefan;: Possibly counterproductive if everyone goes outside to the same place at once
21/03/2020, 17:58 - Rob;: Yeah I expect they will. They are quite distributed throughout London generally any way, but particularly congregate around whee I work on the strand as there are a lot of shelters and charity initiatives around there as well as tourists
21/03/2020, 17:58 - David;: Edinburgh was buzzing yesterday. In the parks, nice weather and all the children starting a 6 month holiday. End of term atmosphere. No social distancing
21/03/2020, 17:58 - Rob;: Surely it's a much reduced risk congregating in the open air though? In an unstructured way with small groups too
21/03/2020, 18:00 - David;: Less surfaces to transmit I guess and people not touching things.
21/03/2020, 18:00 - Rob;: Yeah, and you're not cramming in. Naturally more distanced
21/03/2020, 18:00 - David;: Our death rate is extremely high. Almost as many deaths as US with far less cases.
21/03/2020, 18:01 - Rob;: So perhaps we have far more cases?
21/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: We’re not doing much testing
21/03/2020, 18:02 - David;: Yeah I think our testing is much worse
21/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: Italy just getting destroyed
21/03/2020, 18:02 - David;: Deaths is a better metric. You don't miss any deaths but you miss lots of cases
21/03/2020, 18:03 - Stefan;: It does suggest the virus is far more widespread already than we thought
21/03/2020, 18:04 - Phill: Maybe this virus been around for months and no one knew? 🤔
21/03/2020, 18:04 - David;: At least the private hospitals are chipping in now. Ridiculous that hadn't happened already
21/03/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: I was reading about how Italy got most of its early cases from countries no one new had it yet, like Germany, while it was focusing exclusively on people coming in from China
21/03/2020, 18:33 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 18:33 - Hamish Sinclair: This is quite  a good discussion about the virus
21/03/2020, 18:33 - Hamish Sinclair: Albeit with annoying American accents
21/03/2020, 18:44 - Paul;: Now saying shitting yourself could be a sign of Coronavirus
21/03/2020, 18:46 - David;: So we've had it for years?
21/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
21/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Making it up as they go along
21/03/2020, 18:47 - David;: Wasn't there a chart saying shitting definitely nothing to do with it?
21/03/2020, 18:48 - Paul;: Yep now it turns out everyone was shitting themselves
21/03/2020, 18:48 - Paul;: Very coy and anal
21/03/2020, 18:51 - Phill: Welllll my guts have been in bits
21/03/2020, 18:52 - David;: My guts are a mess but pretty sure that's mostly to do with the chilli and wine.
21/03/2020, 19:06 - Paul;: But it could be the vid
21/03/2020, 19:14 - David;: Only if produces ring burn exactly identical to chilli slops
21/03/2020, 19:21 - Rob;: Maybe they realised everyone is constantly shitting awfully. Like warning that walking is a symptom, won't narrow it down at all.
21/03/2020, 19:26 - David;: Would lead to a lot of false positives yes. If we all have to get tested whenever we have sloppy shit. I'd tested every time I had a coffee.
21/03/2020, 19:26 - Paul;: Lol how much is coffee ruining you? I get struck 1 in 5 times I think
21/03/2020, 19:28 - David;: Depends. Can deal well with real cafetiere coffee past 12 o'clock. But in the morning or instant coffee then it's a write off
21/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: Prem to come back before end of restrictions
21/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: Behind closed doors televised games
21/03/2020, 19:59 - Rob;: Big

21/03/2020, 20:29 - David;: Really nothing in shops now
21/03/2020, 20:29 - David;: Bare bones
21/03/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: They have run out?
21/03/2020, 21:35 - David;: No fresh stuff at all
21/03/2020, 21:36 - David;: No staples, running low on sauces etc.
21/03/2020, 21:36 - David;: Junk food holding up fine. Sweets, crisps etc. no problem
21/03/2020, 21:55 - Hamish Sinclair: Ready made sandwiches
21/03/2020, 21:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Lots of ready made sandwiches presumably because people no longer buying onbeay to work
21/03/2020, 22:06 - David;: Yeah, or people are worried that people have touched them while prepping?
21/03/2020, 22:07 - David;: they want forms of food that haven't seen a human in months - your pasta sauces, your tinned hot dogs.
21/03/2020, 22:52 - David;: The decline from actual MotD to essentially 3 blokes chatting over a glass of wine is stark

22/03/2020, 11:52 - / James Ball: Currently I have 40 litres of very yeasty ovaltine
22/03/2020, 11:53 - Paul;: Not tempted to just drink it all now?
22/03/2020, 11:53 - / James Ball: But beer incoming
22/03/2020, 11:53 - / James Ball: Just ferment it inside me
22/03/2020, 12:36 - David;: If you add yeast to piss. Viable drink?
22/03/2020, 12:37 - David;: At a push. Assuming a worst case scenario.
22/03/2020, 12:37 - Phill: No sugar in piss
22/03/2020, 14:27 - David;: Nice day for the apocalypse anyway. Balmy

22/03/2020, 14:51 - / James Ball: Just been in the garden. Pruning the ceanothus
22/03/2020, 14:52 - / James Ball: Will be nice little garden for boozing in the summer

22/03/2020, 16:13 - David;: Lol
22/03/2020, 16:13 - Damian Rumble: Nah
22/03/2020, 16:13 - David;: Nice cheery message
22/03/2020, 16:13 - David;: Everyone is being so nice to each other.
22/03/2020, 16:14 - Damian Rumble: Maybe they were referring to the coast... Because the end of the land is indeed very near... Before it becomes the sea
22/03/2020, 16:15 - David;: It feels like everyone in the country is acting as if they had a huge row with each other last night and some dark shit was said and are now being really polite and gentle to make up for it
22/03/2020, 16:39 - David;: It's a golden age for ticket to ride online. So many players in the forum. Can get a game instantly.
22/03/2020, 16:44 - Rob;: Did not know there was an online version
22/03/2020, 16:46 - Paul;: It’s where the hardcore play
22/03/2020, 16:54 - David;: It's get very intense. Deep strategy
22/03/2020, 17:03 - Sam;: Daily briefing on the way..
22/03/2020, 17:04 - Jack G;: Stronger enforcement incoming?
22/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Everyone just frousting down?
22/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Alcoholism is definitely going to skyrocket
22/03/2020, 17:13 - David;: Old people going to get screwed
22/03/2020, 17:19 - Rob;: Seems like no for now
22/03/2020, 17:19 - Paul;: Rather dull update
22/03/2020, 17:20 - Jack G;: Tories cut police numbers so much they don’t have enough resource to do much enforcement
22/03/2020, 17:20 - David;: Thought the 12 week thing had already been implemented?
22/03/2020, 17:21 - Jack G;: They’re all getting a letter now though Dave, will make all the difference...
22/03/2020, 17:23 - David;: Also housemates and carers popping in and out all the time anyway.
22/03/2020, 17:23 - Paul;: Yeah you’d have thought they’d need to take better measures
22/03/2020, 17:24 - Paul;: How many police would you need to enforce 1.5m people?!?
22/03/2020, 17:24 - Paul;: I don’t think it makes a huge difference
22/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: As they’re so specific
22/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: Almost a 1 for 1 required
22/03/2020, 17:25 - Jack G;: It’s not just these 1.5 million people though, loads of others ignoring the advice. You’d think these most vulnerable would need the least amount of enforcing considering the huge risk to them
22/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: You just can’t help Damian’s more police or not
22/03/2020, 17:30 - / James Ball: Just need to make an example of a few people and it will help
22/03/2020, 17:32 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51962930
22/03/2020, 17:32 - Paul;: Null and voiding the season still on the cards
22/03/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: I wonder how much they will have factored in the effect that the measures taken will have on other hospitalisations - fewer flu cases in the elderly, less strain on A&E as the pubs are closed and events are off etc
22/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: That was a big factor on cancelling events?
22/03/2020, 17:55 - David;: Bit of a nothing update
22/03/2020, 17:56 - Jack G;: Interesting to hear that currently 12% of ICU beds are being taken up by COVID patients. Seems high for this point of the epidemic?
22/03/2020, 17:58 - David;: Close to killing the same number as the first day of the Somme globally now.
22/03/2020, 18:22 - David;: <Media omitted>
22/03/2020, 18:23 - Paul;: Ah hotel colon
22/03/2020, 18:23 - Paul;: My brothers colon
22/03/2020, 18:23 - David;: Do you want to book a room in the colon?

22/03/2020, 18:45 - Paul;: So it does actually mean hotel anus essentially
22/03/2020, 18:46 - Paul;: Chosen to name it that

22/03/2020, 18:59 - Phill: <Media omitted>
22/03/2020, 19:45 - Paul;: Saying Italy ded because 25% of population over 65 and lots live with people aged 18-35
22/03/2020, 19:58 - David;: >wiggle
22/03/2020, 19:58 - David;: That fucking song.
22/03/2020, 19:59 - Rob;: Yeah. Never want to hear it again
22/03/2020, 19:59 - Paul;: Good how irrelevant all the celebrities become during a pandemic. Did you see they did a highly embarrassing rendition of imagine
22/03/2020, 20:00 - Rob;: >The idea that they thought they were helping with that
22/03/2020, 20:01 - Paul;: Great how out of touch they are. Slowly getting more and more irrelevant
22/03/2020, 20:01 - Paul;: Must be driving them mad
22/03/2020, 20:02 - David;: Fuck off. Hopefully this burst the shitty b celebrity bubble.
22/03/2020, 20:02 - David;: Reality TV must finally be gone after this.
22/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-51959070
22/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: Of course the bbc is fawning over them
22/03/2020, 20:08 - David;: Any good films out on streaming then?
22/03/2020, 20:14 - David;: Actually very shit
22/03/2020, 20:14 - Paul;: Yeah incredibly shit
22/03/2020, 20:14 - David;: Looked it up on youtube. Such an annoying way of singing
22/03/2020, 20:15 - David;: We'll no longer be able to afford the celebrity class after the pandemic.
22/03/2020, 20:15 - David;: They'll have to get proper jobs again
22/03/2020, 20:18 - Paul;: Will be good to get rid of them
22/03/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: I agree. But how do we stop people become celebrities from the bits of culture we like?
22/03/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: Like the people in films
22/03/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: Are we just saying: thanks for being in the films. There's no money left now thanks to the virus. Have a few thousand pounds like everyone else
22/03/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: I'm on board with that
22/03/2020, 20:21 - Paul;: Yeah have to reduce salaries
22/03/2020, 20:21 - Paul;: Here’s a tenner
22/03/2020, 20:21 - Rob;: That is sort of what happened to most musicians already
22/03/2020, 20:23 - David;: Yeah. Still make the film's we'll just charge you an average wage for it and not hold you up as gods to be revered. Also trim it down a lot, like in the way we are shedding the minor royals and only keeping the direct line of accession.
22/03/2020, 20:24 - David;: Maybe make 12 really good films a year. You get one a month.
22/03/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: The reality tv celebs will be feeling it the worst. They’ll start doing some ridiculous things to stay relevant soon
22/03/2020, 20:27 - Rob;: I would like at least 24 films a year
22/03/2020, 20:27 - Rob;: Like what if two in a row are The Lady in the Van
22/03/2020, 20:27 - Paul;: Lol
22/03/2020, 20:28 - David;: Nah you get 1 a month. Remember we still have all the film's already made.
22/03/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: None of them are allowed to be cgi either. I want a return to animatronics
22/03/2020, 20:29 - Rob;: In the future no one will be able to make a film about anything but staying inside a house, as that's all they know
22/03/2020, 20:29 - Rob;: And Parasite's already done that
22/03/2020, 20:30 - Rob;: 12 films a year. All of them about working from home
22/03/2020, 20:33 - Paul;: Always filmed from 3rd person so you only see back of heads
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: What else can we scrap
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: The great pandemic reset
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: F1
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: First to go
22/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: Hasn’t impacted at all by it not being on
22/03/2020, 20:44 - Rob;: Going to work 5 days a week might not come back. Almost every company will find itself with the infrastructure and precedent to let people work from home
22/03/2020, 20:45 - Rob;: Could dampen down rush hour and make commute time less important in properly prices. Might open up pockets of redevelopment as people move to cheaper areas
22/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: There’s been no advantage of me going into work so far compared to what I can do from home
22/03/2020, 20:47 - Rob;: Fucks me a bit, but that's more to do with their shit server not handling the number of vpn requests. I do miss it though. I'd carved myself an extremely unprofessional little niche
22/03/2020, 20:48 - Paul;: Your unprofessional niche?
22/03/2020, 20:48 - Rob;: Used to mercilessly create any chaos I could
22/03/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: Got very bored a couple of years ago and entertain myself by just fucking shit up in very minor ways
22/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: Lol such as
22/03/2020, 20:49 - Paul;: You’re a saboteur
22/03/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: Every work birthday card has an inappropriately worded message from the same senior guy in it

Many bit of paper in the printer will just have 'fuck you' written on the back of them. Same for random pages in the work notebooks. Have been doing a good line in seemingly real work announcements, like fake employee of the month things
22/03/2020, 20:56 - Rob;: Have developed a little slot on the window everyone gazes out of while waiting for the printer, will normally be a cartoon or joke or something. Became quite popular.
22/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Lol what do you mean a little slot? Like your own prime time tv slot for a cartoon
22/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Had adoring fans?
22/03/2020, 21:00 - Rob;: Just a spot for post its on the window, but you'd hear people talking about it around the office
22/03/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: Not deco obscenia?
22/03/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: No, safe for work, but often anti-establishment
22/03/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: No ones raised the issue of the fuck you on the paper?
22/03/2020, 21:07 - Rob;: Not so far
22/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Do you not think they’d terminate employment if they traced it back to you?
22/03/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Nah
22/03/2020, 21:11 - Paul;: Rob ‘Fuck you’ Goodway
22/03/2020, 21:37 - David;: Was the thing about warmer weather bollocks then?
22/03/2020, 21:50 - Paul;: I think we’ve got a cold wave for the next week or 2
22/03/2020, 21:51 - Phill: Nah, bollocks

23/03/2020, 12:24 - Paul;: hired the worst PR team it could
23/03/2020, 12:33 - David;: Yeah going to save lives overall
23/03/2020, 12:35 - Paul;: The IOC has given itself four weeks to decide on the future of the event.

Options include a delay of several months or - more probably - a year. The IOC says cancellation is "not on the agenda". A "scaled-down" Games will also be considered.
23/03/2020, 12:35 - Paul;: really pushing to keep the olympics on

23/03/2020, 12:54 - Phill: James, you should start a business delivering gear to people. Your car could get loads of shopping in. Charge shit loads for delivery. Profit?
23/03/2020, 12:55 - Phill: (this isn't about profit)

23/03/2020, 13:20 - Paul;: your local milkman is operating a call centre?
23/03/2020, 13:21 - Paul;: with 25k people ahead of you for servicing the area around eynsham?
23/03/2020, 13:23 - / James Ball: Correct although the website is national they don't service the whole country
23/03/2020, 13:23 - Paul;: how desperate are you to get in touch with the milkman?
23/03/2020, 13:24 - / James Ball: Not very. I was absent mindedly just going to check what they still had in stock
23/03/2020, 13:34 - Paul;: and now everyone is frantically after the milkman
23/03/2020, 13:34 - Paul;: absurd
23/03/2020, 13:37 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
23/03/2020, 13:43 - Damian Rumble: There's going to be a wealth of social-economic, political, geographical and medical PhDs to study this period for the next 30 years
23/03/2020, 13:44 - Damian Rumble: For anyone who ever thought "what if humans just [nearly] vanished over night"?
23/03/2020, 13:45 - Damian Rumble: Bring an all new meaning to "20/20 hindsight"
23/03/2020, 14:22 - David;: Fortunately we set up weekly milk and veg deliveries months ago. Feeling pretty good about that decision now.
23/03/2020, 14:33 - Paul;: think supply chains should start evening out this week / next now all the panic buyers / hoarders (jack) have months of supply
23/03/2020, 14:35 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
23/03/2020, 14:37 - Jack G;: Our Asda has loads of stuff in today. Must have had a delivery in the morning, seems like you’re right.
23/03/2020, 14:39 - Jack G;: Also if all restaurants/pubs are shut surely that wholesale stock could be diverted to supermarkets?
23/03/2020, 14:41 - Paul;: yes some of that will be diverted into peoples homes
23/03/2020, 14:41 - Paul;: as no one going out to eat
23/03/2020, 14:50 - David;: Can't be flogging artisinally sourced scallops for mitchelin starred restaurant chefs down Lidl though.
23/03/2020, 14:51 - David;: Yeah, less stress. Fewer industrial accidents. Less pollution.
23/03/2020, 14:52 - David;: Suddenly lots of bulk pizza dough flour, sirloin steaks etc. hitting the shelves?
23/03/2020, 14:54 - David;: Where will all the KFC stuff go - loads of cheap chicken wings in the shops maybe?
23/03/2020, 14:56 - Jack G;: Got to go somewhere surely. No point letting it rot in a warehouse

23/03/2020, 15:39 - Paul;: *were
23/03/2020, 15:40 - Damian Rumble: Finally. If brexit can't rid of the foreigners maybe a health crisis and breakdown our basic way of life will do the trick...
23/03/2020, 15:48 - David;: Paid for the 30 days though?
23/03/2020, 15:49 - David;: Yeah the tennants in my flat in Leam were Polish and suddenly decided to go back to Poland at no notice because of fears over border closures.
23/03/2020, 15:49 - David;: Paid rent for March, didn't even see it out.

23/03/2020, 17:59 - David;: Ah was just about to post that
23/03/2020, 17:59 - Paul;: I’ve gone hen mad
23/03/2020, 17:59 - David;: Hoarding livestock
23/03/2020, 17:59 - Paul;: Jack how many hens you got at home?
23/03/2020, 17:59 - David;: I must buy hens. The most vital thing right now is to be egg self-sufficient
23/03/2020, 18:00 - Phill: What does this stat even mean?
23/03/2020, 18:00 - Phill: <Media omitted>
23/03/2020, 18:01 - / James Ball: To be honest the only thing I couldn't get on my shop earlier was eggs
23/03/2020, 18:01 - Phill: 8.1% of what?
23/03/2020, 18:01 - / James Ball: Increase day on day
23/03/2020, 18:01 - David;: increase in cases
23/03/2020, 18:01 - David;: per day
23/03/2020, 18:01 - David;: they are increasing at 8.1%, down from 9%
23/03/2020, 18:02 - / James Ball: It increased 8.1% from previous day's figure
23/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: It's badly phrased there should be a % sign after both numbers
23/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: otherwise the first number could be read as an integer
23/03/2020, 18:06 - / James Ball: The BBC, badly phrased?
23/03/2020, 18:07 - David;: Have to wait till 8.30 for the update.
23/03/2020, 18:07 - David;: Shit show brewing surely
23/03/2020, 18:08 - / James Ball: Yeah, that's a big sign. Police on the streets
23/03/2020, 18:08 - / James Ball: Army at the corner shop
23/03/2020, 18:08 - Phill: 8:30

23/03/2020, 18:11 - Phill: Might watch Seinfeld entire catalogue
23/03/2020, 18:11 - David;: Yeah that would be a good shout.
23/03/2020, 18:12 - David;: I've downloaded all studio Ghibli films
23/03/2020, 18:12 - Paul;: Hal’s moving castle?
23/03/2020, 18:13 - David;: yeah yeah
23/03/2020, 18:14 - David;: Really want to gump the trip to greece but no torrents anywhere
23/03/2020, 18:14 - Phill: But they streamable on Netflix?

23/03/2020, 18:17 - Hamish Sinclair: Sounds like a safe place to be
23/03/2020, 18:27 - Paul;: Got to be a huge announcement later
23/03/2020, 18:42 - David;: Or double bluff? Nothing announced
23/03/2020, 18:43 - Sam;: Lol. Just for a bit of banter.
23/03/2020, 18:43 - Sam;: Keep the spirits up

23/03/2020, 19:19 - Damian Rumble: As if a world leaders single goal was to out trump trump at everything
23/03/2020, 20:09 - David;: What I'd like is for a prem game to happen days after all the squads come out of isolation. So you'd see a game with elite players but no carefully prepared game plans or very well drilled formations etc.
23/03/2020, 20:10 - Phill: And they all fat and unfit
23/03/2020, 20:10 - David;: It would take a lot of the sports science, conditioning and facilities inequalities between the big and small players out of the equation
23/03/2020, 20:11 - David;: Reckon they will all have personal fitness programmes they won't just be frousting
23/03/2020, 20:11 - David;: *big and small clubs
23/03/2020, 20:21 - Damian Rumble: "The 2020 Olympic Games will be postponed by one year because of coronavirus, says International Olympic Committee member Dick Pound."

23/03/2020, 20:30 - Sam;: Here we go
23/03/2020, 20:30 - Sam;: Full on address. Not a press conference
23/03/2020, 20:31 - David;: No Pressy
23/03/2020, 20:33 - Sam;: LOCKDOWN

23/03/2020, 20:36 - Hamish Sinclair: 👍
23/03/2020, 20:37 - Paul;: Sam is your boss likely to be unconvinced by this as he knows a guy at a hospital?
23/03/2020, 20:38 - David;: Boris got such a Churchill hard on over this
23/03/2020, 20:38 - Sam;: He fucking made me a a few other redundant the wanker
23/03/2020, 20:40 - Paul;: Today?
23/03/2020, 20:41 - Sam;: Last Thursday
23/03/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: Welcome to redundancy club
23/03/2020, 20:42 - Damian Rumble: Mate... Not cool
23/03/2020, 20:42 - Sam;: He’s a tit. Been get daily updates from the one guy still employed. of what a shot storm it is
23/03/2020, 20:42 - Damian Rumble: The government should be paying your wages now apparently
23/03/2020, 20:42 - Sam;: No handovers he’s just got to deal with it all himself.
23/03/2020, 20:43 - Paul;: This seems like a more striking financial crisis than the last one
23/03/2020, 20:44 - Sam;: Yeah has to be
23/03/2020, 20:45 - David;: This has fucked the real economy first not the financial sector. So mass unemployment
23/03/2020, 20:45 - Paul;: Good point there deviiiid
23/03/2020, 20:45 - David;: You can't fully QE your way out of it. Plus they had already used up a lot of monetary policy levers by not normalising interest rates.
23/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: Wonder what you can do next
23/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: No one will be hiring
23/03/2020, 20:46 - David;: Has to be fiscal stimulus
23/03/2020, 20:46 - Paul;: Need that 1k real bad
23/03/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: People will be too afraid to spend though
23/03/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: The psyche has changed which you can’t fiscally stimulate
23/03/2020, 20:48 - David;: No point doing it now. Has to be timed for when we are exiting the lockdown measures to boost confidence and demand
23/03/2020, 20:50 - Sam;: Still stuff about, I’m talking to a recruitment firm called 923 Jobs about a couple of roles in Oxford. Check them out Paul.
23/03/2020, 20:50 - Paul;: 👍🏻
23/03/2020, 20:51 - Sam;: https://www.linkedin.com/company/923-jobs
23/03/2020, 20:54 - David;: Good news though. Arteta is feeling better.
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: This is going to be a long dull lockdown
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: In for the long haul
23/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: The long dark froust of the soul
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: With the parents
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: No boozing
23/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: Why no boozing?
23/03/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: They just don’t like boozing
23/03/2020, 20:55 - David;: But you can just quietly booze in the corner?
23/03/2020, 20:56 - Damian Rumble: Interests rates already at 0.1%. already maxed out the levers for improving the economy. Going to be soo much borrowing that's really going to really drive up inflation
23/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: We'll probably have to start fermenting our own piss. Best to start now.
23/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: Give us our £1k
23/03/2020, 20:57 - Paul;: It’s the only logical conclusion
23/03/2020, 20:57 - David;: It doesn't cause inflation when the economy is so far below capacity.
23/03/2020, 21:00 - Damian Rumble: Surely borrowing = QE = inflation
23/03/2020, 21:01 - David;: None of those things necessarily equals the other
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: Money = Money Dave
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: Gnome represents Gnome
23/03/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: Brown = brown
23/03/2020, 21:05 - David;: Public sector borrowing can be done either via QE or through open bond markets. QE basically involves adding new money to bank of england computers and using that to buy public, financial sector or corporate debt. That would only create inflation if their is no slack in the economy and it is already running at full capacity so it translates to higher prices. But now, when there is going to be a huge slack in capacity and mass unemployment it would stimulate demand and avoid companies going bust.
23/03/2020, 21:06 - David;: Also the interest payments on additional government debt are going to be tiny at the moment as interest rates are virtually zero. And you are unlikely to get punished with capital outflow because all other countries are doing exactly the same thing so there is nowhere else for capital to go. So it's pretty much risk free.
23/03/2020, 21:07 - David;: This is as close to the exact situation Keynesian economics models as you can get.
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Give everyone £100k?
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Or a little lottery each week
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: That would be fun
23/03/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Lots of prizes. Everyone’s a winner
23/03/2020, 21:13 - / James Ball: Sounds very soviet
23/03/2020, 21:13 - / James Ball: Today the government is holding a meat raffle
23/03/2020, 21:13 - / James Ball: Today the government is holding a lottery winners have their families released from prison

23/03/2020, 21:25 - David;: You should read this story
23/03/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Lol that sounds great
23/03/2020, 21:26 - Phill: >this email from our MD just now. His delusion.

23/03/2020, 21:27 - Paul;: Lol
23/03/2020, 21:28 - David;: Wait what is he trying to suggest that doesnt mean people should stay at home?
23/03/2020, 21:29 - Phill: He's basically trying everything he can to keep people on building sites working
23/03/2020, 21:29 - Phill: All my staff have called to say they won't be in tomorrow
23/03/2020, 21:30 - David;: Obvs
23/03/2020, 21:30 - David;: You can't fight that tide
23/03/2020, 21:31 - David;: He is Cnut
23/03/2020, 21:33 - Paul;: That’s what sambos old boss was saying
23/03/2020, 21:33 - Paul;: He said he had a mate in the nhs who told him to ignore government advice
23/03/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: So my phone battery died while we were moving and I couldn't find where I'd packed my charger until just now
23/03/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: Welcome to the locky
23/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Full on lockdown?
23/03/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: Depends how you interpreted it
23/03/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Glad I got here, but fucking hell do I not have all the essentials. Mattress, sofa and internet all meant to be coming soon, but will this fuck that?
23/03/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: Yeah this could be a big fucker but deliveries should still continue
23/03/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: You can no longer go to a shop to buy anything non food
23/03/2020, 21:43 - David;: Lol that's a great situation to enter the lockdown in
23/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: Keeps things interesting
23/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: The opposite of hoarding. Stripping down everything in preperatio.
23/03/2020, 21:45 - / James Ball: Welcome to the no internet club
23/03/2020, 21:46 - Paul;: It’s more exclusive than redundancy club
23/03/2020, 22:00 - / James Ball: Most exclusive is currently the no furniture club
23/03/2020, 22:00 - Rob;: Well, if I can't get back to my old flat for my work Mac, which I deemed to valuable to load into a huge van, I perhaps will be in the redundancy club too
23/03/2020, 22:02 - Rob;: And the no kettle club, population: me
23/03/2020, 22:08 - / James Ball: Well there's always the government meat raffle to look forward to
23/03/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Yeah would enjoy that
23/03/2020, 22:08 - / James Ball: Might get a sausage. Might get a spatchcock. Who knows
23/03/2020, 22:09 - Phill: Why not just furlough you?
23/03/2020, 22:16 - Phill: Love that 7 days ago the strategy was to infect as many people as possible to establish herd immunity
23/03/2020, 22:16 - Paul;: I liked being part of the herd
23/03/2020, 22:22 - / James Ball: #bringbacktheherd
23/03/2020, 22:23 - Phill: This air quality doe.
23/03/2020, 22:23 - / James Ball: yeah, no noise either
23/03/2020, 22:23 - Phill: Lol this bint on TV
23/03/2020, 22:24 - / James Ball: no con trails
23/03/2020, 22:24 - Phill: "I have a kid at home. He gets hungry"
23/03/2020, 22:31 - Phill: Global economy should contra charge China for this.
23/03/2020, 22:36 - / James Ball: yeah, makes sense.
23/03/2020, 22:53 - Phill: MIKE ASHLEY IS COMEDY GOLD

23/03/2020, 22:54 - Phill: <Media omitted>
23/03/2020, 23:05 - David;: 3 weeks min of this
23/03/2020, 23:07 - David;: Oh John
23/03/2020, 23:35 - Phill: Is whitty a droid?
24/03/2020, 08:12 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 08:14 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 08:15 - Phill: Lol all our site staff have basically said fuck off they aren't going to site
24/03/2020, 08:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Lol, legally does your company still have to pay them?
24/03/2020, 08:17 - Phill: No, but the moral impacts of not doing so are shit. Also if we don't pay now they won't hang around afterwards when we'll need them
24/03/2020, 08:18 - Phill: It's stupid, there's thousands of grotty men working closely together in enclosed spaces in London on sites and they're open. It's also a who blinks first game unless the govt order shutdown because whoever delays the work is liable for damages
24/03/2020, 08:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Should just stop work for 2 weeks
24/03/2020, 09:12 - Damian Rumble: Surely the government ordered it so they are liable
24/03/2020, 09:12 - David;: But they haven't ordered it - that's the whole point?
24/03/2020, 09:15 - Phill: Govt haven't ordered anything and a minister immediately afterwards said sites would remain open
24/03/2020, 09:18 - David;: How do you social distance to someone you're working in a building team with?
24/03/2020, 09:21 - Phill: Just try your best to work apart - problem is all London sites are crowded places in enclosed areas
24/03/2020, 09:22 - David;: I don't get how food shopping 'as little as possible' corresponds to the advice not to hoard/panic buy. It's by shopping often that you don't need to stock up
24/03/2020, 09:23 - David;: So am I now doing my duty to panic buy and then bed down?
24/03/2020, 09:25 - Rob;: Also, inner city populations are closer to smaller supermarkets with small stock and no trolleys. Hard to get a full week's shop there at once
24/03/2020, 09:25 - Jack G;: Just been out to get the bins back in. Does that count as my daily allotted exercise?
24/03/2020, 09:25 - Phill: Yeah you're not allowed out again
24/03/2020, 09:26 - Jack G;: Lol
24/03/2020, 09:26 - Jack G;: Wasn’t planning to anyway, bedding in
24/03/2020, 09:27 - David;: Haha. Yeah also don't step outside to collect a parcel that will use up your trip out
24/03/2020, 09:27 - Phill: Sank a bottle of red wine last night after announcement - my arse this morning.
24/03/2020, 09:31 - / James Ball: Particularly rancid I expect. What was the food load?
24/03/2020, 09:31 - David;: The thirst as well. Desert mouth. What was the tannin structure like?
24/03/2020, 09:32 - David;: Can get those furry tannin reds that really hang around in your mouth
24/03/2020, 09:38 - Phill: Food was courgette pasta with ricotta
24/03/2020, 09:40 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 09:40 - David;: Peaked in Italy
24/03/2020, 09:41 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 09:42 - David;: Lol
24/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: Could get a sweepy going on the Italy daily death rate. Keep life interesting in the lock down
24/03/2020, 09:44 - David;: Give Paul his lottery
24/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: Ricotta won't be helping the arse
24/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: Was hoping for prolonged exponential growth in Italy
24/03/2020, 09:46 - / James Ball: Could just be the calm before the storm
24/03/2020, 09:47 - David;: 'hoping for'
24/03/2020, 09:47 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 09:48 - / James Ball: Welllll. Newsworthy isn't it
24/03/2020, 09:48 - / James Ball: Good bit of news
24/03/2020, 09:49 - David;: Yeah, it will seem a bit of a Damo squib if we do all this over c. 6000 deaths. Less than normal seasonal flu deaths per year.
24/03/2020, 09:49 - David;: That's the problem if the strategy suceeds it looks like an over-reaction
24/03/2020, 09:49 - David;: *damp
24/03/2020, 09:53 - David;: Death rate sweepy? I go 560.
24/03/2020, 09:54 - / James Ball: 560 total in UK today?
24/03/2020, 09:55 - David;: Nah for Italy today
24/03/2020, 09:59 - / James Ball: Got to check numbers first
24/03/2020, 10:04 - / James Ball: To get *dat* line of best fit on the bell curve I reckon lower. More like 520
24/03/2020, 10:04 - / James Ball: Unless there's a second wave
24/03/2020, 10:06 - David;: James goes 520
24/03/2020, 10:06 - David;: In the sweepy
24/03/2020, 10:13 - Phill: Tfw I've been WFH for over a week and now everyone is calling for advice on how to set shit up
24/03/2020, 10:13 - Phill: Godlike.
24/03/2020, 10:17 - Damian Rumble: 540
24/03/2020, 10:19 - / James Ball: Sneaking in between. Very much a weasel or stoat. A pine marten if you will
24/03/2020, 10:23 - Damian Rumble: Tbh the pine marten a quite a good spirit animal for me.
24/03/2020, 10:25 - / James Ball: My parents were staying in a holiday cottage in Scotland that had a daily pine marten visit. It just ate peanut butter sandwiches
24/03/2020, 10:27 - David;: The spirit animal
24/03/2020, 10:27 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 10:28 - Paul;: 495

24/03/2020, 10:32 - / James Ball: Are you sure you're not some kind of high functioning arthropod?
24/03/2020, 10:33 - Damian Rumble: Cheeky
24/03/2020, 10:34 - / James Ball: Dave - 560

24/03/2020, 10:35 - David;: Should probably make it in increments of 10
24/03/2020, 10:36 - / James Ball: Nahh. Good to get the precision in
24/03/2020, 10:38 - David;: Yeah, but someone could be trolled if someone goes one above and someone else one below. You're left with only that exact number possible. Increments of 5?
24/03/2020, 10:39 - / James Ball: There's no way it won't come down to one exact number
24/03/2020, 10:40 - David;: Yeah. But say you go 100. I go 101. Paul goes 99. We would both have a huge range left to us and you would need it to be 100 exactly.
24/03/2020, 10:40 - / James Ball: Then I would have had to have chosen well
24/03/2020, 10:41 - David;: Lol, fine.
24/03/2020, 10:41 - David;: As you were then
24/03/2020, 10:41 - / James Ball: Lol. Currently only Sambo and dePaul trolling each other
24/03/2020, 10:42 - David;: Yeah, Paul got a decent range up to James as well.
24/03/2020, 10:42 - Stefan;: 650
24/03/2020, 10:42 - Stefan;: I'm not calling a sustained drop in death rate just yet
24/03/2020, 10:42 - / James Ball: Ooof go big or go home eh
24/03/2020, 10:43 - Phill: 591
24/03/2020, 10:43 - Stefan;: Only locked down 2 weeks ago, takes around 1 month from a new infection to death
24/03/2020, 10:43 - / James Ball: Stefan - 650
Phil - 591
Dave - 560

24/03/2020, 10:45 - / James Ball: They'll troll us and not release death stats today
24/03/2020, 10:45 - Sam;: 6000 new cases yesterday in Spain. Oof
24/03/2020, 10:46 - / James Ball: They'll probably all recover.
24/03/2020, 10:46 - / James Ball: Just have a cerveza
24/03/2020, 10:47 - David;: you're all low-balling
24/03/2020, 10:51 - Rob;: Hamish go 651
24/03/2020, 10:56 - Rob;: Got internet. James you're on your own now
24/03/2020, 10:56 - Rob;: The guy said he expects this to be his last day connecting people
24/03/2020, 10:57 - / James Ball: Hopefully different in rural Oxfordshire
24/03/2020, 10:58 - Rob;: Sofa delivery cancelled though. Holding out for a mattress at least
24/03/2020, 11:05 - / James Ball: London is fucked right? Everyone still going to work
24/03/2020, 11:09 - Rob;: Zone 1 office land is definitely deserted
24/03/2020, 11:12 - Paul;: i want to throw in an 812 as well
24/03/2020, 11:13 - Stefan;: There's a big drop off in people commuting for work, but they also cut tube services massively. So the rush hour trains still running are rammed
24/03/2020, 11:18 - / James Ball: Office workers safe. General workers dead
24/03/2020, 11:27 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 11:30 - Paul;: dat salmon
24/03/2020, 11:38 - Damian Rumble: It is markedly less busy out of my window of Cally road today. The occasional jogger or people heading to the coop and reappearing a moment later disappointed
24/03/2020, 11:45 - David;: Um. But Rob sir, the helicopter is not an animal.
24/03/2020, 11:46 - Phill: >An Jet Fighter
24/03/2020, 11:49 - / James Ball: Horses get 4 entries - seems unfair?
24/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: The helicopter is technically a drupe
24/03/2020, 12:48 - Paul;: lol trying to do the court cases online - none of them have a clue how to use computers
24/03/2020, 12:54 - Stefan;: Yeah I'm sitting at home with no hearings to go to, waiting for judges to figure out how to use Skype
24/03/2020, 13:55 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 13:55 - Paul;: day on the nos would be great
24/03/2020, 13:56 - Rob;: Ah yeah
24/03/2020, 13:56 - Rob;: We could Skype and nos
24/03/2020, 14:07 - Rob;: _WoLoveCream_
24/03/2020, 14:18 - Damian Rumble: When is the Wales revamp due for completion? I am wondering whether it would be worthwhile booking that in sooner rather than later. I imagine when quarentine is lifted people are going to go mad for holidays and it's highly like that foreign travel could be extremely limited at that point still.
24/03/2020, 14:38 - Sam;: Taylor Wimpy and TFL have closed construction sites.
24/03/2020, 15:04 - Paul;: india on a 21 day locky
24/03/2020, 15:11 - Phill: Sauce?
24/03/2020, 15:23 - Sam;: Presenter on 5 Live said it.
24/03/2020, 15:32 - Stefan;: Can confirm through reliable sources
24/03/2020, 15:38 - Paul;: can confirm via internet
24/03/2020, 15:47 - Paul;: An earlier one-day curfew, which was seen as a trial, was flouted by many. At 17:00 on Sunday as part of a nationwide lockdown, Mr Modi called on Indians to clap and cheer emergency services from their balconies, but many misunderstood the call, congregating in the streets as they danced and chanted.

“It’s impossible to fathom the cost that India may have to pay if such irresponsible behaviour continues,” Mr Modi warned. “Social distancing is the only option to combat corona.”
24/03/2020, 15:47 - Paul;: lol how did they troll themselves so hard
24/03/2020, 15:58 - Damian Rumble: Lol tbh I'm not entirely sure how India and South East Asia haven't been more badly shafted by this pandemic. Modern, but poorly organised societies with weaker central governments and corruption/general lack of adherence to the rules should be a perfect breading ground for the virus
24/03/2020, 15:58 - Paul;: Yeah is a bit odd
24/03/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: Unless it’s already deeply infected them and they’re too late
24/03/2020, 16:13 - David;: Lol that's brilliant.
24/03/2020, 16:14 - / James Ball: Actually severly affected but poor testing, treatment and reporting
24/03/2020, 16:14 - / James Ball: ?
24/03/2020, 16:21 - David;: Japan are dealing very well with this. Considering old population, huge urabn population density
24/03/2020, 16:46 - Phill: Ah. Got to furlough 5 people now.
24/03/2020, 16:47 - Phill: India and Japan both counties with low meat intake.
24/03/2020, 16:55 - David;: Seems like it will just stay like this now? They are only clarifying existing guidance.
24/03/2020, 16:59 - Paul;: Never leave the lockdown
24/03/2020, 17:00 - Damian Rumble: Japan had a pre existing culture of respecting personal space and wearing face masks if you a bit under the weather which I imagined probably helped
24/03/2020, 17:07 - David;: Ah Italy death figures out. 743.
24/03/2020, 17:07 - David;: Oh John
24/03/2020, 17:09 - Paul;: Big John
24/03/2020, 17:14 - David;: Stock market up 9% though
24/03/2020, 17:14 - David;: Biggest daily rise
24/03/2020, 17:14 - / James Ball: Stefan wins
24/03/2020, 17:15 - David;: Yeah Stefan wins the daily sweep
24/03/2020, 17:16 - David;: Your prize: more lockdown.
24/03/2020, 17:16 - David;: We all win the same thing every day
24/03/2020, 17:16 - Paul;: What about the meat raffle?
24/03/2020, 17:16 - / James Ball: That's up to BOJO
24/03/2020, 17:17 - / James Ball: I do have a gammon hock in the fridge though - very meat raffle
24/03/2020, 17:18 - David;: The meat comes from the flesh of the loser?
24/03/2020, 17:18 - David;: So the loser has to donate a leg as flesh for the winner.
24/03/2020, 17:18 - / James Ball: Sam
24/03/2020, 17:19 - / James Ball: Sounding very much like a game of president. need to swap your best organs at the end of the round
24/03/2020, 17:19 - / James Ball: President has a lot of liver, peasant just lots of bowel
24/03/2020, 17:20 - Damian Rumble: Ahh... A cunning strategy
24/03/2020, 17:20 - Stefan;: Sam, I'll take my meat raffle prize now
24/03/2020, 17:21 - Stefan;: Stocks are running low
24/03/2020, 17:43 - / James Ball: https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2020/03/23/nursing-home-hungry-hippos-coronavirus-mh-orig.cnn
24/03/2020, 17:53 - Sam;: Oh fuck. Chopping of me grogodions
24/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: Meh grogodoines
24/03/2020, 18:01 - Paul;: USA might let it run and not bother with a locky
24/03/2020, 18:01 - Paul;: Back to normal by Easter
24/03/2020, 18:02 - David;: Who's saying that?
24/03/2020, 18:02 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
24/03/2020, 18:03 - David;: Will be interesting. How fucked that might get
24/03/2020, 18:04 - David;: The imperial model said that mitgation alone without supression would still kill over 1m people in US.
24/03/2020, 18:04 - Paul;: Trumpy no locky
24/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: The amount of people suing after this in the US
24/03/2020, 18:06 - Damian Rumble: September 2020. The world returns to normal but all travel to the USA is banned due to a hot bed of the virus. I wonder how that will go down for the US economy...
24/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: If he lets it loose
24/03/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: He should do shouldn’t he though just so we can see what happens
24/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: Forecast of a 24% decline in US GDP for the second quarter
24/03/2020, 18:09 - David;: Quarter of the economy gone.
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Hospital  now completely divided into red and green zones
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Red being covid positive or suspected
24/03/2020, 18:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Theyve divided staff into red and green teams, and the two cannot mix
24/03/2020, 18:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Red teams work 14 days in a row with 14 days off afterwards to self isolate...
24/03/2020, 18:23 - / James Ball: What colour are you?
24/03/2020, 18:47 - Damian Rumble: Is that as it stands or under the trump "do nothing and be casually racist about it" plan?
24/03/2020, 18:48 - Damian Rumble: Seems smart... Though surely you are effectively commiting to be half staffed for the foreseeable future...
24/03/2020, 19:04 - David;: Quite dystopian.
24/03/2020, 19:04 - David;: That's as it stands.
24/03/2020, 19:13 - Damian Rumble: Got a source for that?
24/03/2020, 19:13 - Hamish Sinclair: Green
24/03/2020, 19:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, an underclass within an underclass
24/03/2020, 19:14 - Hamish Sinclair: Someone I work with got evicted by their landlady at the weekend because they deemed her too high risk
24/03/2020, 19:20 - David;: Goldman Sachs
24/03/2020, 19:21 - Paul;: You might have heard of them. Little building society
24/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: That's mental
24/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Like actually illegal, there is a ban on evictions.
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Phill: Buffett here
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: I think it was a "soft" eviction
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Rob;: Yeah, I've seen a couple of landlord eviction emails shared online on the same basis
24/03/2020, 19:23 - Hamish Sinclair: The woman went fucking mental and made her wear gloves and masks around the house and spent the whole time crying
24/03/2020, 19:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Told her she had to go, by which point she had already decided she couldn't stay and so didnt fight it
24/03/2020, 19:33 - Phill: Just told 5 people they're furloughed. One girl literally cried for an hour down the phone moaning.
24/03/2020, 19:33 - Phill: Why you moaning? You get a month off on almost full pay!
24/03/2020, 19:35 - Phill: Anyone watching The English Game on Netflix?
24/03/2020, 19:52 - David;: Nah but seen it. Is it a new thing?
24/03/2020, 19:53 - Phill: Yeah some downton style drama centred around the FA cup in the 1870's
24/03/2020, 19:53 - / James Ball: >watching videos online
>flaky 4G connection
>#myphoneisintheloft
24/03/2020, 19:53 - Rob;: Ah. So there's sort of football to watch is what you're saving?
24/03/2020, 19:54 - David;: Any good?
24/03/2020, 19:54 - Phill: Yeah. An old Etonian currently moaning about player salaries
24/03/2020, 19:55 - David;: Never experienced football withdrawal like this. Usually there is at least a constant drip feed of transfer news
24/03/2020, 20:11 - / James Ball: If it returns behind closed doors, how many injuries will be back by then
24/03/2020, 20:11 - / James Ball: might swing things if key players are back
24/03/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: One good team will have forgotten how to play and one shit team will suddenly be good
24/03/2020, 21:11 - Phill: Yeah the US is fucked. WHO saying it's going to become new epicentre.
24/03/2020, 21:13 - Rob;: Might actually be something Trump can't spin
24/03/2020, 21:17 - Jack G;: “We’ve got the biggest virus, the best virus. More virus than anyone”
24/03/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: We beat Italy's death toll bigly
24/03/2020, 21:18 - / James Ball: He doesn't even try and spin though
24/03/2020, 21:18 - / James Ball: he just lies and blames someone else
24/03/2020, 21:23 - / James Ball: "Trump says he wants the country 'opened up and just raring to go by Easter,' "
24/03/2020, 21:23 - / James Ball: Coronavirus done in 19 days according to trump
24/03/2020, 21:23 - Phill: At the same time
24/03/2020, 21:23 - Phill: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52012048
24/03/2020, 21:24 - / James Ball: Wellll.
24/03/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: I feel like a lot of officials in the US are just going to start straight up ignoring him and going past him if they're not already
24/03/2020, 21:31 - / James Ball: "So, I think Easter Sunday, and you'll have packed churches all over our country. I think it would be a beautiful time. And it's just about the timeline that I think is right,"
24/03/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: Time to increase bottle pissing rate and wear Kleenex boxes on my feet
24/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: Contact not extended due to corona. So I will be joining redundancy club in 2 weeks
24/03/2020, 21:44 - David;: Ever-expanding club.
24/03/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: 4 members now
24/03/2020, 21:52 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 08:41 - Jack G;: https://www.ft.com/content/5ff6469a-6dd8-11ea-89df-41bea055720b
25/03/2020, 08:42 - Jack G;: Looks like we’ve all had it already
25/03/2020, 08:43 - Paul;: subscription barrier jack
25/03/2020, 08:44 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 08:45 - Paul;: so panic over nothing
25/03/2020, 08:45 - Paul;: the common cold
25/03/2020, 08:51 - / James Ball: I mean, I would say I just seemed to get way worse colds this winter
25/03/2020, 08:52 - Paul;: yes my cold was a lot worse and hadn't had one in 3 years
25/03/2020, 08:52 - / James Ball: slightly different from a regular cold but not awful
25/03/2020, 08:53 - Paul;: yes, felt different but didn't have the symptoms they keep going on about - but they haven't released a spectrum of symptoms from mild to extreme
25/03/2020, 08:53 - Jack G;: Apparently loss of smell and taste are now symptoms
25/03/2020, 08:53 - / James Ball: A friend of mine's wife works in that lab
25/03/2020, 08:54 - / James Ball: ah. just like what happens with a stuffy nose? I definitely had that for a day
25/03/2020, 08:55 - Paul;: it's just a big troll virus
25/03/2020, 08:55 - / James Ball: quite a trolly virus. Occasional death but usually just a cold
25/03/2020, 08:55 - Paul;: with the number of celebrities and politicians who are all testing positive it's safe to assume from a small sample like theirs that it is incredibly widespread
25/03/2020, 08:56 - Paul;: you could make that assumption?
25/03/2020, 08:57 - / James Ball: biased set though. celebrities and politicians more likely to travel and meet a lot of people
25/03/2020, 08:58 - / James Ball: the only thing it doesn't explain is why we're seeing increased deaths no and not before it was already so widespread
25/03/2020, 08:59 - Jack G;: I think there’s quite a long time between initial contraction and death. A huge laggy virus
25/03/2020, 09:00 - Paul;: that is true
25/03/2020, 09:05 - Phill: You could lose a few thousand deaths if they looked like something normal
25/03/2020, 09:06 - / James Ball: yeah but if we all had it in February then there would be a more even death rate and not such a spike now. even accounting for lack of testing etc
25/03/2020, 09:23 - Paul;: on dial in's with webcam - all these middle aged men who choose to wear superdry
25/03/2020, 09:23 - Paul;: that's an unacceptable pandemic
25/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: Can you link the kind of superdry outfits they are sporting
25/03/2020, 09:33 - David;: Need to visualise the overall look
25/03/2020, 09:34 - Paul;: just the general big logo shite
25/03/2020, 09:34 - Paul;: https://www.google.com/search?q=superdry+tshirt&sxsrf=ALeKk021X2gF1M3xGRCF1LQjyC2anuGqEw:1585128853370&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi5v-mRqbXoAhXzThUIHaGyDkMQ_AUoAnoECAwQBA&biw=1280&bih=610
25/03/2020, 09:36 - David;: How has this happened? Who told then it was acceptable?
25/03/2020, 09:37 - Paul;: it's everywhere in the midlands - superdry dads as far as the eye can see
25/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: yeah, it's a big thing. middle class dads wanting to look young
25/03/2020, 09:45 - / James Ball: go buy themselves a nice £80 hoody
25/03/2020, 09:48 - Phill: I just wish Superdry would use more branding and zips on their clothing. I'd probably buy it then.
25/03/2020, 09:51 - Sam;: <Media omitted>

25/03/2020, 10:04 - Jack G;: You now have more bog roll than me. I can finally pass the torch on
25/03/2020, 10:07 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
25/03/2020, 10:12 - / James Ball: time to preserve things in salt? grit the path?
25/03/2020, 10:19 - Phill: Preserve your shit
25/03/2020, 10:19 - Phill: Salt your shit
25/03/2020, 10:20 - Damian Rumble: Remember all the deaths are people with pre existing health conditions succumbing to pneumonia in ill prepared health systems across the world.
25/03/2020, 10:22 - Damian Rumble: Germany has an impressively large amount of capacity in its health system and sees some of the best survival rates of any nation.
25/03/2020, 10:23 - / James Ball: yeah, but if we all got it as early as february, are we really only seeing those early deaths now, 6/7 weeks later?
25/03/2020, 10:28 - David;: Ah. Thoughtful, but it seems she's gone for pure bulk and quantity here.
25/03/2020, 10:28 - / James Ball: did she at least order a case of wine?
25/03/2020, 10:28 - Phill: Got beccas brother on a wine run for us this morning
25/03/2020, 10:29 - David;: Most people would buy a few fancy chocolates and flowers. She's gone for a years supply of basic salt and toilet paper
25/03/2020, 10:32 - Rob;: No alcohol
25/03/2020, 10:32 - Phill: Harsh.
25/03/2020, 10:32 - Phill: I'm running dangerously low on weed.
25/03/2020, 10:33 - / James Ball: grow some?
25/03/2020, 10:33 - Phill: Yeah 8 weeks tho
25/03/2020, 10:33 - Rob;: She's not a drinker. It's fine. We have a few bottles of wine and spirits and we're going to get a beer delivery from the brewery round the corner
25/03/2020, 10:34 - Phill: But yes. I'm using this distraction to grow some Peng Leng.
25/03/2020, 10:36 - / James Ball: I'm still best part of a fortnight away from my beer. only got 4 bottles of wine left

It's not just Italy. In the week 16-22 March, Madrid's NO2 levels were down 41% compared with 2019, and Lisbon's rates were down 51%.

25/03/2020, 16:51 - David;: Little pressy on the way then. The daily meat raffle
25/03/2020, 16:57 - David;: Ah good, no migrant workers to pick the harvest this year so mass food shortages possible.
25/03/2020, 16:57 - David;: So all the unemployed can return to the land.
25/03/2020, 16:57 - David;: A peasant lifestyle. Could be alright.
25/03/2020, 16:59 - Paul;: lol so one month of being green diverts us back to the 1300's

25/03/2020, 17:03 - David;: Yeah peasant revolt in 1388 direct result of the black death.

25/03/2020, 17:09 - Sam;: Bojo did say that self employed help will be in tomorrow’s episode
25/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: yeah, I saw rischi rich say that too
25/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: hopefully it's not just a tax cut
25/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: hopefully it's cold hard socialist cash
25/03/2020, 17:10 - Paul;: the £1k
25/03/2020, 17:12 - / James Ball: I presume they will essentially do the same thing they're doing for PAYE but base it off my profit instead
25/03/2020, 17:12 - / James Ball: it's just about the only thing they could do that was fair
25/03/2020, 17:13 - / James Ball: Maybe average profit over the last 3 years or something to stop everyone putting in a really high income on 5th April

25/03/2020, 17:23 - / James Ball: Rob had a trolly 681
25/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: But rob also had no original thought. If I’d said 670 he’d have gone 671
25/03/2020, 17:25 - Paul;: I inspired that (now voided) choice
25/03/2020, 17:26 - Paul;: It was not within the spirit of the sweepy
25/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: sweepy spirit
25/03/2020, 17:27 - Paul;: 683 was actually the past 5 day average. That’s how I picked 680
25/03/2020, 17:30 - Stefan;: Enjoying my state-approved daily outing for exercise
25/03/2020, 17:30 - Stefan;: Physical jerks

25/03/2020, 17:54 - Paul;: Nah what is it?
25/03/2020, 17:54 - Phill: Curb your enthusiasm ?
25/03/2020, 17:55 - Phill: You dwelling under a rock?
25/03/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: Oh I thought you meant she was watching a series called curb that you hadn’t heard of
25/03/2020, 17:56 - Paul;: Curb and the other series curb your enthusiasm
25/03/2020, 18:06 - David;: It does make things a lot more peaceful. Fan of the locky
25/03/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: Just another 2 and a bit weeks left of the locky
25/03/2020, 18:07 - Paul;: Should surprise us with lockdowns more often
25/03/2020, 18:08 - Jack G;: Will surely be extended at least a further 2 weeks?
25/03/2020, 18:09 - Paul;: Have you got enough bog roll to get through that?
25/03/2020, 18:11 - David;: Never heard of Curb. So shes got the entire 15 series or whatever to revisit now?
25/03/2020, 18:11 - David;: Is she aware the early ones are much better as well
25/03/2020, 18:17 - Sam;: She’s completely unaware.
25/03/2020, 18:25 - / James Ball: Charges of attempted murder in South Africa and a man killed by a crocodile while defying Rwanda's lockdown are some of the developments in Africa.
25/03/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: leaving lockdown is dangerous. too many crocs
25/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: <Media omitted>

25/03/2020, 20:02 - David;: 21m mobile phones accounts were cancelled in China during the quarantine apparently.

25/03/2020, 20:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Were they using phones to track people in quarantine?
25/03/2020, 20:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Pretty sure Korea did something like this
25/03/2020, 20:11 - David;: Yeah they were
25/03/2020, 20:11 - Hamish Sinclair: Perhaps people cancelled their own phones
25/03/2020, 20:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah the article actually says that's impossible
25/03/2020, 20:13 - David;: this is suggesting that it is a requirement to have a phone so can't purely be people cancelling to save money. It could be a lot of people cancelling work phones because not going in, but that would be unlikely to explain it all. Hence they are inferring they could be under-reporting the overall mortality rate
25/03/2020, 20:13 - David;: But could be bollocks
25/03/2020, 20:35 - Sam;: This message was deleted
25/03/2020, 20:36 - Sam;: Sorry, accidental dick pic

25/03/2020, 20:54 - David;: Yeah wouldn't have noticed. Could have got away with that.
25/03/2020, 20:54 - Rob;: I'm assuming it wasn't a dick pick, otherwise who are you sending a dick pick when you're quarantined with your girlfriend?
25/03/2020, 20:57 - Sam;: Her. We’re in different rooms.
25/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: Lol, too lazy to walk to the next room with your dick out
25/03/2020, 20:58 - David;: Or is it the element of surprise?
25/03/2020, 20:58 - Paul;: Lol
25/03/2020, 20:59 - David;: Keeps her honest.
25/03/2020, 21:15 - Paul;: The old meat and two veg

The shoots have been cancelled and I don't think Tesco will want a mag with no pictures, unless we end up just doing a virus 'cook with cans' edition with stock imagery for them.

26/03/2020, 13:38 - David;: An ironic punishment for the panic buyers
26/03/2020, 13:47 - Paul;: lol, i assume we'll never get our boom times - being fucked from all sides. 2008 crash and now virus depression - our parents lucked out massively
26/03/2020, 13:47 - Paul;: no one young really had any savings either before this
26/03/2020, 13:49 - David;: Plus climate change and decarbonisation. Don't forget that nice looming disaster.

26/03/2020, 13:52 - David;: I sense next couple of weeks the consensus will be severely tested. There may be a backlash.
26/03/2020, 14:03 - Phill: Economy held together with pritt stick and masking tape.
26/03/2020, 14:20 - Damian Rumble: I thought that was me?
26/03/2020, 14:24 - Damian Rumble: Unemployment looks horrific but it's not like the 1930s. The moment the virus has receeded in the summer all the music and sports industry all those jobs will return and James Ball will have work again (providing he hasn't starved to death or succumbed to some shitty arse based disease by then)
26/03/2020, 14:29 - Paul;: lol a shitty arse based disease
26/03/2020, 14:29 - Paul;: the lingering impact of covid
26/03/2020, 14:41 - David;: Partially true but it's the hysterisis - companies that go bust completely, unemployed not all taken back on, then become gradually less employable, loss of demand from people having been furloughed/on unpaid leave etc. Going to have longer-term effects.
26/03/2020, 14:42 - David;: Basically you can't just mothball an economy and start it up again instantly
26/03/2020, 14:44 - Rob;: But we all still get our grand, right?
26/03/2020, 14:44 - Rob;: The grand will save us
26/03/2020, 14:44 - Damian Rumble: You can buy literally anything with a grand
26/03/2020, 15:54 - David;: https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-news-live-coronavirus-update-today-cases-press-conference-white-house-a9426771.html
26/03/2020, 15:54 - David;: Words are irrelevant

26/03/2020, 17:17 - Jack G;: 662 for Italy, Paul wins
26/03/2020, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: Again!
26/03/2020, 17:23 - David;: You win another day of lockdown
26/03/2020, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: Paul the octopus
26/03/2020, 17:24 - / James Ball: paul is racking up the days of lockdown
26/03/2020, 17:25 - Hamish Sinclair: We will need to get a trophy for this
26/03/2020, 17:25 - Jack G;: He should be so locky. Locky, locky, locky
26/03/2020, 17:26 - David;: 👏
26/03/2020, 17:26 - Damian Rumble: 80% of profits for James...  But not until June. Not especially helpful
26/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: yeah, better than nothing
26/03/2020, 17:27 - Jack G;: Will it get back dated at least?
26/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: can presumably be back dated
26/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: i think the june date is implied that it will take ages to set up
26/03/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: I was hoping it would be averaged over the past couple of ta
26/03/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: x returns
26/03/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: annoyingly my 2019 return was much lower than my 2018 return
26/03/2020, 18:13 - / James Ball: ah. average of the past 36 months. grants are still taxable
26/03/2020, 18:17 - Jack G;: Phil wins UK sleepy
26/03/2020, 18:17 - Jack G;: Sweepy*

26/03/2020, 18:18 - Damian Rumble: Big
26/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: Ah so it’s getting worse
26/03/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: But the locky

26/03/2020, 18:36 - Phill: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 18:46 - Stefan;: Excellent. Death is my victory.
26/03/2020, 18:48 - David;: Bit of a tight chest
26/03/2020, 18:49 - / James Ball: ah. death imminent
26/03/2020, 18:49 - / James Ball: are you sure it's not just breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Paul;: This is a classic case of breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Paul;: Don’t trick yourself
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Phill: He's breathing out. Next.
26/03/2020, 18:50 - Paul;: Proven time and time again to be a case of breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:51 - Phill: On the tombstone:

"He's breathing out"
26/03/2020, 18:52 - / James Ball: Both Rob and I have suffered from a bit of breathing out so far. nothing to worry about
26/03/2020, 18:54 - Rob;: Yeah, it got very noticeable for an evening, but I can put that entirely down to anxiety about house move (had a choice between a week of homelessness or lose a lot of money at one point) multiplied by corona
26/03/2020, 18:54 - Rob;: It's just breathing out
26/03/2020, 18:55 - Phill: I had a good 2 months last year where I couldn't not think about my breathing. Constantly out of breath.
26/03/2020, 18:55 - Phill: Triggered during a weed smoking night.
26/03/2020, 18:56 - Paul;: More or less intense than the PODSU event?
26/03/2020, 18:56 - Phill: Less intense but more annoying and debilitating
26/03/2020, 18:58 - Phill: The only thing that fixed the CO2 balance in my blood thus restoring comfortable breathing was going on a lung shattering run
26/03/2020, 19:00 - David;: The what?
26/03/2020, 19:01 - Phill: Where I had a mental glitch in a meeting and my brain just went onto a loop repeating PODSU PODSU PODSU PODSU from Laputa
26/03/2020, 19:01 - David;: Lol
26/03/2020, 19:01 - David;: Quite a predicament
26/03/2020, 19:02 - David;: I usually don't have a problem remembering to breathe out
26/03/2020, 19:02 - Paul;: Which thing in laputa is it that goes PODSU?
26/03/2020, 19:04 - Phill: When she wakes up in his lighthouse first day and he's showing her that her neck piece is magic and he jumps off a ledge and gets rekt in the brick and she goes "PODSU!! Are you alright?"
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Would this have been noticable to anyone else in the room?
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Paul;: Ah he’s called PAZU
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Paul;: PAZU PAZU PAZU
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Phill: No
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Phill: Podsu
26/03/2020, 19:05 - / James Ball: >japan
26/03/2020, 19:05 - Paul;: Lol
26/03/2020, 19:06 - Paul;: PODSU
26/03/2020, 19:06 - Phill: No it was a mental loop. Outwardly I was forecasting quarterly cash flow
26/03/2020, 19:06 - / James Ball: inwardly japan
26/03/2020, 19:07 - Phill: Correct.
26/03/2020, 19:08 - David;: Lol. Still managing to do that while internally there was nothing left but PODSU
26/03/2020, 19:10 - David;: I was reading people with clinical anxiety are feeling better. Because usually they are worried the worst might happen and everyone is carrying on as normal. But now the worst has happened and everyone else agrees with them
26/03/2020, 19:11 - David;: So their thought patterns are no longer pathological but rational and socially sanctioned
26/03/2020, 19:12 - Phill: Agree with this. Just got adrenal fatigue.
26/03/2020, 19:12 - / James Ball: yeah, I'm actually feeling pretty good now about locky. Just bored
26/03/2020, 19:13 - Phill: Also more empathy about now. Give more of a shit about people on benefits etc. NHS. Hopefully instigates a long term social shift towards a more inclusive society... ....but probably not.
26/03/2020, 19:14 - Paul;: As long as there’s a continued backlash against celebrities that would be worth it
26/03/2020, 19:18 - Phill: Tfw buying all my food from online french supermarkets now.
26/03/2020, 19:18 - Phill: https://www.frenchclick.co.uk/
26/03/2020, 19:18 - / James Ball: fewer gwyneth paltrows would be worth it
26/03/2020, 19:18 - / James Ball: what buy?
26/03/2020, 19:19 - Phill: Merguez. Frites. Fromage.
26/03/2020, 19:19 - Phill: Poullet de Bresse
26/03/2020, 19:19 - Phill: If this weather holds up I'll be having barbecued french sausage and vin by the gallon
26/03/2020, 19:20 - David;: Hard not to drink every night
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: Yes.
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: Very.
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Hamish Sinclair: Would love to know the average weight gain per person
26/03/2020, 19:20 - Phill: I'm losing weight.
26/03/2020, 19:21 - / James Ball: I'm on a diet anyway, losing weight all the time
26/03/2020, 19:21 - Hamish Sinclair: ?
26/03/2020, 19:21 - / James Ball: no mid week drinking also in place
26/03/2020, 19:21 - David;: Yeah. You should move into which every branch of medicine deals with obesity and booze problems. Cardiovascular stuff? Big growth area after this
26/03/2020, 19:22 - David;: Had all of this going in January. Seems a long time ago.
26/03/2020, 19:22 - Phill: Not eating snacks at work. 3 normal meals a day. Finish work bang on 5 so getting a run in. Lunches and breakfast is healthy and not pastry/sausage roll/crisp based
26/03/2020, 19:23 - David;: Yeah we're having good meals in the day. It's just at night a strong tendency to booze.
26/03/2020, 19:24 - David;: Fay's hitting the bourbon old fashioneds
26/03/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: good to get a cocktail in
26/03/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: we've got a lot of spirits
26/03/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: might do a whiskey weekend
26/03/2020, 19:47 - Damian Rumble: I find sitting at home all day extremely lethargic. Sloth breeds sloth
26/03/2020, 19:56 - / James Ball: ISS flying over southern UK tonight
26/03/2020, 19:56 - / James Ball: easy to spot with the clear skies
26/03/2020, 19:57 - / James Ball: 20:29
26/03/2020, 20:01 - David;: This clapping for carers thing
26/03/2020, 20:01 - David;: Very Soviet
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Rob;: Yeah, very odd
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Rob;: No carers actually there to see as far as I know
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: All gather to cheer in the street like the Indians
26/03/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: Spread the virus further
26/03/2020, 20:03 - David;: People going mad for it here
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Jack G;: One of my neighbours has just let off some fireworks
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Damian Rumble: People in the block opposite us have got David Bowie heroes playing out across the street at full volume
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Stefan;: Yeah wild for it here, fireworks everywhere
26/03/2020, 20:04 - Damian Rumble: Stefan I can see you house from where I am standing

26/03/2020, 20:05 - Rob;: Blitz spirit
26/03/2020, 20:05 - / James Ball: fireworks here recently too
26/03/2020, 20:05 - Rob;: This is why we Brexited
26/03/2020, 20:06 - / James Ball: have our own virus our way
26/03/2020, 20:06 - David;: Brexiteers believed in privatising healthcare before this I believe?
26/03/2020, 20:07 - David;: Don't see them mentioning that so much
26/03/2020, 20:07 - Jack G;: Nah they all thought we’d be getting 350 million a week more for nhs
26/03/2020, 20:08 - David;: Your hannans etc. are big on privatising healthcare
26/03/2020, 20:09 - Stefan;: Where are you?
26/03/2020, 20:10 - / James Ball: london?
26/03/2020, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: Atkins square
26/03/2020, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 20:13 - / James Ball: is that where you live or have you illegally broken locky laws Damo?
26/03/2020, 20:14 - Paul;: Of course he’s broken regulations
26/03/2020, 20:17 - Phill: The autism. The complete lack of respect for the NHS. The liberal Tory. The cunt.
26/03/2020, 20:17 - Rob;: He does look like he's buying himself food...
26/03/2020, 20:18 - / James Ball: photo looks like it's from height though
26/03/2020, 20:18 - Phill: Also he's looking at Stefan's house and taking screenshots.
26/03/2020, 20:22 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 20:22 - Stefan;: Oh yeah that's your girlfriend's place near me
26/03/2020, 20:28 - Damian Rumble: Do you fancy popping out for a chuck about in our state sponsored exercise session at some point?
26/03/2020, 20:35 - / James Ball: illegally breaking quarantine to see your girlfriend
26/03/2020, 20:35 - / James Ball: exactly the thing trying to be stopped
26/03/2020, 20:36 - Phill: Flagrant
26/03/2020, 20:37 - Stefan;: I'll meet you in a park but I'm not touching a frisbee that someone else has handled
26/03/2020, 20:38 - Paul;: Damo you are patient zero. Not caring for the rules
26/03/2020, 20:38 - Paul;: We should lock you up
26/03/2020, 20:39 - David;: He is the pangolin
26/03/2020, 20:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah pretty sure you're supposed to either move in or break up?
26/03/2020, 20:53 - Phill: This is true. My sister has moved in with her boyfriend because she was moving back and forth.
26/03/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: The rules don’t apply to Damian remember
26/03/2020, 20:54 - Phill: You mean liberal elite in general.
26/03/2020, 20:56 - Damian Rumble: I actually forgot to bring mine. You bring the plastic and I'll bring the sanitiser?
26/03/2020, 21:59 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
26/03/2020, 22:00 - Paul;: Dat herd tho
26/03/2020, 22:01 - / James Ball: a herd of dead cattle
26/03/2020, 22:06 - David;: Quite a lot of cases today
26/03/2020, 22:06 - David;: Really got away from us
26/03/2020, 22:07 - / James Ball: 8215 deaths in Italy
26/03/2020, 22:10 - / James Ball: italy still worse by most metrics
26/03/2020, 22:10 - David;: More deaths than first day of the Somme now
26/03/2020, 22:12 - / James Ball: san marino very johnned if you sort by deaths/pop - 619/million
26/03/2020, 22:12 - / James Ball: only actually 21 deaths
26/03/2020, 22:27 - Damian Rumble: All blown over by Easter...
26/03/2020, 22:28 - / James Ball: yeah, next weekend it will be fine
26/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: This is going to get so much worse.
26/03/2020, 22:32 - Phill: 1bn cases and 80million deaths I reckon is my sweepy.
26/03/2020, 22:32 - / James Ball: but Phil, Trump says it will be fine next weekend
26/03/2020, 22:33 - Phill: Thousands is pussy talk. This is just ramping up. A blind summit.
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: just worked out what my socialist free cheque from government will be
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: £951.82 per month
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: less than minimum wage
26/03/2020, 22:55 - / James Ball: 👌
26/03/2020, 22:56 - Paul;: It’s like labour government simulator
26/03/2020, 22:56 - / James Ball: would be quite a surprise if BOJO wins the labour leadership election too

27/03/2020, 07:15 - Hamish Sinclair: This project is being run out of KCL and guys where I used to work. Think they are trying to gather data on how virus is spreading in the absence on community wide testing

27/03/2020, 09:17 - Damian Rumble: Trying to claim that his hard left wing agenda has been proved right by the Coronavirus
27/03/2020, 09:18 - Damian Rumble: Forsure spending more money on the NHS would have helped, but I am not sure that Coronavirus has justified nationalising rail, water, broadband, energy, post and education
27/03/2020, 09:24 - Jack G;: I think he was trying to make the point (granted quite poorly) that it proves the money has always been there and the last 5 years of austerity was an ideological choice
27/03/2020, 09:50 - / James Ball: Yeah I think the point was more in the interest of showing that the Torys are pricks more than anything
27/03/2020, 09:56 - Rob;: But he has managed to frame it from a personal vindication angle, rather than the more appropriate 'the government could and should have chosen to make your lives better'
27/03/2020, 09:56 - Rob;: Gone quite Kevin Keegan 'I'd love it if we beat them'
27/03/2020, 09:59 - / James Ball: Yes, it does have a rather outgoing manager vibe to it

27/03/2020, 14:33 - Jack G;: Will keep rising this quickly for another 10 days I reckon. Only at the start of the locky so won’t see benefits for a while
27/03/2020, 14:34 - Rob;: Yeah I was looking at other country's curves and when they locked down, seems to take 10-15 days to slow noticeably
27/03/2020, 14:35 - Rob;: More of a case of but how much worse would be it have been without lockdown, rather than expecting lockdown to solve things on its own
27/03/2020, 14:37 - Paul;: so should we expect to rise up towards 600/700 per day?
27/03/2020, 14:38 - Jack G;: Hopefully slightly lower, maybe in 500 range? I can’t see much we’ve done differently from the other countries that got to those numbers

27/03/2020, 14:45 - Jack G;: Our curve seems to be coming back down after a terrible start
27/03/2020, 14:46 - Phill: So mortality rate appears to be 5%. But this is 5% of serious, tested, cases of which the estimate is 20% of cases. So if we multiply 14,000 by 5 to give estimate of cases we get 759 deaths from 70000 cases. 1% mortality.
27/03/2020, 14:46 - Jack G;: Also depends a huge amount on age and underlying conditions

Don't throw away that Grand National sweepstake kit... because a virtual race will be held in place of one of the UK's biggest sporting occasions.

The National, held at Aintree and first run in 1839, was cancelled earlier this month because of the coronavirus outbreak.

In its place, 40 of the runners will take part in the virtual version, which uses CGI technology and special algorithms.

It will be broadcast by ITV at 17:00 BST on Saturday 4 April - the day the National was planned to run.

The special broadcast will also pit Aintree legends Red Rum and Tiger Roll - who this year was bidding for an unprecedented third consecutive win in the famous steeplechase - against each other in a 40-horse Race of Champions.

27/03/2020, 17:05 - David;: Yeah that's the issue
27/03/2020, 17:05 - David;: Caused by their idiocy but consequences felt equally
27/03/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: Like undeveloped nations and climate change
27/03/2020, 17:06 - Stefan;: The consequences will definitely be felt harder in aggregate by his voting base in the US (old people)

27/03/2020, 17:07 - Stefan;: It's going to get really bad there, the US so poorly equipped to deal with it
27/03/2020, 17:07 - David;: So it will have some net anti-idiocy effect at population level

28/03/2020, 13:12 - Jack G;: Nah I’d just have crisps and beer for dinner if that was the case
28/03/2020, 13:13 - David;: No crisps, we can't afford food diversification in a post-covid world
28/03/2020, 13:14 - David;: Just bulk pasta and large Heinz ketchup bottles
28/03/2020, 13:50 - Sam;: Full review of 2018 World Cup on bbc one right now
28/03/2020, 14:23 - David;: Ah
28/03/2020, 14:24 - David;: Will need to engage with that
28/03/2020, 14:24 - Rob;: I just series linked it, so there might be more? Unless it's just cos it's branded match of the day
28/03/2020, 14:28 - Damian Rumble: Agreed
28/03/2020, 15:01 - Jack G;: 260 uk deaths
28/03/2020, 15:01 - Rob;: Really having a mad one
28/03/2020, 15:08 - / James Ball: ah, that's a win for me then
28/03/2020, 15:10 - Paul;: USA death rates have got to explode soon
28/03/2020, 15:10 - Paul;: ripe for hitting a 2000 a day figure in the next few days
28/03/2020, 15:13 - / James Ball: don't forget the dip to 0 next Sunday
28/03/2020, 15:16 - Jack G;: What were USA deaths yesterday? I couldn’t find a figure
28/03/2020, 15:25 - Paul;: <Media omitted>

28/03/2020, 16:33 - / James Ball: boring press conference
28/03/2020, 16:33 - / James Ball: do well to keep deaths under 20,000
28/03/2020, 17:17 - David;: Very noticeable how they've made the slogan colours yellow blue and red now. Obviously trying to implicate all of the parties in this equally.
28/03/2020, 17:22 - Paul;: https://metro.co.uk/2020/03/24/couples-living-apart-told-move-together-stay-apart-coronavirus-lockdown-12450646/
28/03/2020, 17:23 - / James Ball: @447854020575 aka pangolin
28/03/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: 'Moan'
28/03/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: 'that fucking drag race bollocks'
28/03/2020, 17:26 - / James Ball: perfect married life
28/03/2020, 17:27 - Paul;: Italy 889
28/03/2020, 17:28 - Paul;: Jack wins more lock in
28/03/2020, 17:28 - Paul;: Now we wait for the meat raffle
28/03/2020, 17:47 - Jack G;: Only 1 out. Closest yet?
28/03/2020, 17:48 - Paul;: Jack you don’t eat ketchup pasta. I can’t allocate you any praise until you change your ways
28/03/2020, 17:50 - Jack G;: Currently making a lasagne, no ketchup in sight
28/03/2020, 17:52 - / James Ball: still the tomato and pasta combo
28/03/2020, 17:52 - Paul;: Yeah could argue your having a farm shop ketchup
28/03/2020, 17:53 - Jack G;: That’s fine, it’s just the Heinz stuff that is wrong
28/03/2020, 17:54 - / James Ball: better call a builder Jack, your argument is crumbling
28/03/2020, 17:55 - Jack G;: It’s not an argument I want to win if the prize is ketchup pasta
28/03/2020, 18:11 - Rob;: I am wholeheartedly with Jack here. Ketchup is not a pasta sauce. Do not want
28/03/2020, 18:12 - Paul;: It’s not just a sauce. It’s a premium ingredient
28/03/2020, 18:13 - / James Ball: I agree it's a shit tier option and I personally haven't had it in years but don't have a problem with it other than that
28/03/2020, 18:15 - Damian Rumble: Ketchup should never, ever, go anywhere near pasta. Those two food stuffs are completely incompatible
28/03/2020, 18:16 - / James Ball: much like pangolins and vegetables?
28/03/2020, 18:17 - / James Ball: also how is the analysis going
28/03/2020, 18:22 - Damian Rumble: I have consolidated the thread history into into a clean data set on Jupyter and I should have some first results by the end of the evening
28/03/2020, 18:23 - Stefan;: We need a word cloud infographic
28/03/2020, 18:23 - Stefan;: Shit and arse will get a strong showing
28/03/2020, 18:26 - Jack G;: Yes! Nice, better than the meat raffle
28/03/2020, 18:28 - Rob;: Are you able to merge with the original Facebook version?
28/03/2020, 18:29 - Paul;: Whatever happens we need data tonight. Don’t get distracted damo
28/03/2020, 18:50 - Phill: Bets on most used words (excluding and, the, it)
28/03/2020, 18:50 - Phill: Honk
28/03/2020, 18:50 - Phill: Hib
28/03/2020, 18:50 - Phill: That's all I've got.....
28/03/2020, 18:51 - Phill: I bet PEADOPOOL makes the filtered top 10
28/03/2020, 18:53 - Sam;: PEADOPOOL
28/03/2020, 19:00 - Damian Rumble: I will be removing stop words
28/03/2020, 19:00 - Damian Rumble: And I can do it on a person by person basis
28/03/2020, 19:01 - Paul;: Feed us data
28/03/2020, 19:04 - Rob;: I bet '7' is high

28/03/2020, 19:24 - Paul;: The soviet state
28/03/2020, 19:56 - David;: Again, I simply refer you back to the Italian chef. I will my take my cue from her rather than an emaciated pangolin.
28/03/2020, 19:56 - David;: Also can't wait for the opta thread stats.
28/03/2020, 19:57 - David;: A merged dataset with the Facebook would be ideal. But might be difficult in practice?
28/03/2020, 19:58 - David;: Also need to print that off in full and wallpaper a room of your house with
28/03/2020, 19:58 - David;: The toilet obviously.
28/03/2020, 19:58 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
28/03/2020, 20:09 - Rob;: Damo, would a potentially fun way to filter words from the thread be to eliminate any that are in the dictionary? Would be good to see what we've invented
28/03/2020, 20:09 - Rob;: Plus all the good typos
28/03/2020, 20:15 - David;: Tiger King on netflix
28/03/2020, 20:15 - David;: Recommend. Theroux like doccy
28/03/2020, 20:15 - Paul;: Too much hype

28/03/2020, 20:16 - David;: Just put it on 5 mins ago. Great
28/03/2020, 20:16 - Damian Rumble: Yeah this could probably be done. I'm almost done with the first version, just going to have some food first
28/03/2020, 20:22 - Rob;: Hyping the release well
28/03/2020, 20:22 - David;: Joe exotic.

28/03/2020, 20:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Number one recommended on netflix
28/03/2020, 20:41 - David;: Yeah but no surrounding buzz. That's fine
28/03/2020, 20:41 - David;: It's the buzz I can't stand
28/03/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: It’s the one programme generating buzz everywhere at the moment
28/03/2020, 20:43 - David;: Never heard of it
28/03/2020, 20:44 - David;: Just clicked on the off chance
28/03/2020, 20:46 - David;: I got in before I encountered any buzz
28/03/2020, 21:34 - / James Ball: buzz now huge though
28/03/2020, 21:35 - / James Ball: big money big buzz
28/03/2020, 21:35 - Jack G;: Dave now part of the buzz
28/03/2020, 21:35 - / James Ball: Dave _is_ the buzz
28/03/2020, 21:42 - David;: Good doccy. Buzz free.
28/03/2020, 21:48 - David;: Damo where's our data?
28/03/2020, 21:52 - / James Ball: data goose
28/03/2020, 21:52 - / James Ball: pls deliver
28/03/2020, 21:52 - / James Ball: a little data for me

28/03/2020, 22:01 - Damian Rumble: Turns out we talk about a lot of the same things so I had to removed all of the words that were common to all of us, as well as our names
28/03/2020, 22:02 - David;: Alot more football based than I would predict
28/03/2020, 22:02 - David;: Less grot more football
28/03/2020, 22:02 - Stefan;: Think these are separate words, lol
28/03/2020, 22:02 - Stefan;: I could very easily have predicted this
28/03/2020, 22:03 - Paul;: Give us more data
28/03/2020, 22:03 - Hamish Sinclair: When I look at Phil's all I see is "Dat liberal cunt goat"
28/03/2020, 22:04 - Stefan;: Dave gets hib, Hamish gets honk honk
28/03/2020, 22:04 - Stefan;: Jack gets a singular honk
28/03/2020, 22:04 - Damian Rumble: Jack clearly loves football the most
28/03/2020, 22:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Think jack has the smallest cunt
28/03/2020, 22:07 - David;: Lol Phil's. Troll cunt arse
28/03/2020, 22:08 - David;: Goat butthurt weed
28/03/2020, 22:08 - Hamish Sinclair: I like rob's idea of removing dictionary words
28/03/2020, 22:09 - Damian Rumble: that will have to be tomorrow
28/03/2020, 22:12 - David;: Good data
28/03/2020, 22:12 - David;: Can you post the combine one for the whole thread?
28/03/2020, 22:13 - Paul;: Yeah what’s the total thread most used words non individual
28/03/2020, 22:14 - Paul;: Feed us our data pangolin
28/03/2020, 22:19 - David;: Ah. Tiger King gets huge
28/03/2020, 22:24 - David;: Lol yeah weekend thread must be a write off for you
28/03/2020, 22:24 - Rob;: Ah this has killed me
28/03/2020, 22:24 - Rob;: I loved that Damo's includes 'Message deleted'
28/03/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: Cunt just very everyday
28/03/2020, 22:32 - Rob;: Out of context gold
28/03/2020, 22:51 - Damian Rumble: http://91-divoc.com/pages/covid-visualization/
29/03/2020, 08:56 - Paul;: Italy 950 uk 250
29/03/2020, 08:57 - Phill: Italy 891 UK 302
29/03/2020, 08:59 - Jack G;: Italy 855 UK 210
29/03/2020, 08:59 - Phill: >UK deaths being below 300. Stay trump.
29/03/2020, 09:26 - Rob;: Italy 1001 UK 352
29/03/2020, 09:50 - Paul;: Now they’re saying Italy is near the peak. Next.
29/03/2020, 09:51 - Paul;: Now saying our locky could be extended till June
29/03/2020, 09:52 - Paul;: The eye of the froust
29/03/2020, 10:07 - Sam;: Rewatching last nights briefing, the medical said that any less than 20,000 deaths would be a good result
29/03/2020, 10:54 - Damian Rumble: Italy 1002 UK 347
29/03/2020, 11:19 - / James Ball: Italy 1100 UK 360
29/03/2020, 11:39 - Paul;: Derek seems to have taken to hoarding milk. A very none hoardable product
29/03/2020, 11:50 - Paul;: how long do you think they'll extend the locky?
29/03/2020, 12:01 - / James Ball: I think peak this month in about 2 weeks
29/03/2020, 12:01 - / James Ball: then they will extend locky to early May
29/03/2020, 12:01 - / James Ball: then everyone will be restless but locky will probably get extended a second time
29/03/2020, 12:11 - Paul;: damian already broke his lockdown - if you recall he was supposed to have reamined isolated for 14 days following his flatmates symptoms
29/03/2020, 12:12 - Paul;: again, tory in disguise damo - doesn't care about anyone else
29/03/2020, 12:13 - / James Ball: ah yes, I'd forgotten he was meant to be self isolating as well
29/03/2020, 12:14 - / James Ball: everyone claps for the nhs, does a little poo for the pangolin
29/03/2020, 12:15 - Damian Rumble: It was a false alarm
29/03/2020, 12:15 - Damian Rumble: No one in our house had covid (that we know of)
29/03/2020, 12:16 - / James Ball: all been tested have they?
29/03/2020, 12:16 - Paul;: that's the whole point damo - you can't tell
29/03/2020, 12:16 - Damian Rumble: My housemate's was coughing was caused by having a probe shoved up her nose as part of a medical procedure
29/03/2020, 12:17 - Damian Rumble: Never the less I have spending less time in mosh pits and old people homes as a precaution
29/03/2020, 12:17 - Damian Rumble: Have been*
29/03/2020, 12:18 - / James Ball: No, you should be not going out as per government advice
29/03/2020, 12:18 - / James Ball: no mosh pits at all not less
29/03/2020, 12:18 - / James Ball: no lizard raves
29/03/2020, 12:22 - Paul;: feckless cunting pangolin
29/03/2020, 12:22 - Damian Rumble: But government advice says one period of exercise a day is ok and moshing is a great full body work out
29/03/2020, 12:22 - / James Ball: away from other people
29/03/2020, 12:22 - / James Ball: not visiting your gf
29/03/2020, 12:23 - Paul;: there will be punishments for this at a future Wales just so you are aware
29/03/2020, 12:23 - Paul;: jack hoarded all the toilet paper you prolonged our lockdown
29/03/2020, 12:24 - Sam;: Mosh pits are fine because they cause the virus to be disorientated and fall to the floor. Dead. A shedding effect
29/03/2020, 12:28 - Damian Rumble: We have been living together during the quarentine, as advised by Boris
29/03/2020, 12:30 - David;: Italy 919, UK 230
29/03/2020, 12:37 - David;: Germany beginning to be johnned now
29/03/2020, 12:38 - Paul;: What’s the latest on Germany?
29/03/2020, 12:39 - Paul;: @447746875764 what’s your toilet roll count?
29/03/2020, 12:51 - / James Ball: I noticed this morning our current roll in the bathroom has almost run out. That's 3 rolls in a fornight
29/03/2020, 12:51 - / James Ball: at this rate we will need restocking in June
29/03/2020, 13:17 - Rob;: Patrick Vallance the UK Science Chief estimates for every known UK case of Corona, there are 1000 actual infections, symptomatic or otherwise
29/03/2020, 13:18 - Rob;: So we'd be on 1 million cases already
29/03/2020, 13:18 - / James Ball: just a little 1 mil
29/03/2020, 13:18 - Paul;: Why bother with the locky then
29/03/2020, 13:18 - Rob;: Which in a way would be good in that the death rate would therefore be lower than the figures suggest, but bas in the sense that the next two weeks could be mental
29/03/2020, 13:19 - Rob;: To slow the rate that the other 66 million people get it?
29/03/2020, 13:19 - Paul;: Did ok getting to a million on the sly. Set it free
29/03/2020, 13:21 - Rob;: So if it continues doubling every 3-4 days, that's everyone getting it in about three weeks
29/03/2020, 13:23 - Paul;: Problem solved. The herd
29/03/2020, 14:04 - David;: 1 million is a pretty shit herd
29/03/2020, 14:04 - David;: Within 65m population.
29/03/2020, 14:04 - David;: A gathering at best
29/03/2020, 14:45 - Paul;: U.K. = 209. Jack wins more lockdown
29/03/2020, 14:48 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
29/03/2020, 16:20 - Rob;: This update is very meat raffle
29/03/2020, 16:20 - Rob;: 'I watched the first deliveries to those locked in for three months. There was cereal. There was fruit. There were toiletries.
29/03/2020, 16:21 - Paul;: Ah the meat raffle in full swing
29/03/2020, 16:21 - Paul;: They should allow regions out of lockdown. See what happens. Near to where we have nhs capacity. Block off roads etc
29/03/2020, 16:21 - Paul;: Let the people have a mad one
29/03/2020, 16:30 - Rob;: Public figures on the briefings getting less and less senior
29/03/2020, 16:30 - Rob;: Intern by next week
29/03/2020, 16:38 - / James Ball: It's Shaun who's on work experience delivering today's briefing; he's a little upset as his predicted grades are not high enough for Exeter
29/03/2020, 16:54 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
29/03/2020, 16:56 - Jack G;: Is this our life now until a vaccine?
29/03/2020, 16:56 - / James Ball: Yeah, but who didn't know that
29/03/2020, 16:56 - / James Ball: My hope is the antibody test will start freeing people up
29/03/2020, 16:57 - / James Ball: may need a mandatory antibody test certificate to be out or something
29/03/2020, 16:57 - Paul;: Yes, fuck being locked down for 6 months
29/03/2020, 17:00 - David;: Antibody test is the game changer
29/03/2020, 17:01 - David;: Problem is if you start letting people out who test positive there's huge perverse incentive to try and deliberately get it so undernines the whole strategy
29/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Would cause a mass breaking of the rules I think
29/03/2020, 17:02 - Paul;: Give me covvy to escape the locky
29/03/2020, 17:02 - David;: Yeah everyone will want to have it as soon as possible which is exactly what you don't want
29/03/2020, 17:03 - David;: Antibody test = herd immunity strategy. It's incompatible with continued supression
29/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: Coronavirus: Belarus Premier League attracts global attention as it plays on - https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52084121
29/03/2020, 17:06 - / James Ball: this though. high fines for not being out without a test certificate
29/03/2020, 17:06 - Paul;: Yeah gimme the test and my certification
29/03/2020, 17:06 - David;: It doesn't solve the problem. You still want to get it test positive to have the certificate
29/03/2020, 17:07 - David;: If the only way to break lockdown is with a positive antibody test everyone who wants to get out will need to contract the disease and then have the test
29/03/2020, 17:07 - / James Ball: surely we do need to slowly expose whole population? either that or sit indoors until the virus is eradicated in the wild
29/03/2020, 17:08 - David;: It would incentivise the exact opposite of what the government wants to happen
29/03/2020, 17:08 - David;: Which is to slow down how quickly people get it.
29/03/2020, 17:08 - Paul;: If any of you get it please spit in an envelope and post it to me
29/03/2020, 17:09 - David;: Case in point.
29/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: lol
29/03/2020, 17:09 - / James Ball: how do we slowly expose then
29/03/2020, 17:10 - / James Ball: and what point is antibody test if it can't be used
29/03/2020, 17:11 - David;: I think you can use it to better assess population immunity to time when we exit from restrictions, and to let care workers back to work. But if you start using it on an on individual basis I can't see how you retain the social distancing measures as everyone who followed the rules would just be a mug who is delaying their own return to freedom
29/03/2020, 17:13 - / James Ball: but surely it will be hard to suppress demand when public learns there is a test that could release them
29/03/2020, 17:13 - David;: Yeah that's why I think antibody test = end of any supression strategy
29/03/2020, 17:14 - David;: People will demand it and when they know they've had it will start ignoring the rules. Then everyone will want to get it as soon as possible
29/03/2020, 17:15 - / James Ball: surely the ignoring the rules is only bad if they can become contagious carriers again
29/03/2020, 17:15 - Stefan;: I think by the time most people know someone who has died or got seriously ill from it, there will be a general reluctance to avoid catching it if possible
29/03/2020, 17:15 - / James Ball: which we don't yet know
29/03/2020, 17:15 - David;: No but it's the more effect on everyone else. It suddenly becomes rational for everyone who hasn't had it to get it.
29/03/2020, 17:16 - Paul;: I really need covid
29/03/2020, 17:16 - Paul;: Will suck for covid
29/03/2020, 17:16 - David;: Not if you are young, not in vulnerable group, have to get back to work, job threatened etc..
29/03/2020, 17:17 - / James Ball: and then what's the issue if you do fit that group
29/03/2020, 17:17 - David;: Because you transmit
29/03/2020, 17:17 - David;: Hence why we are doing all this in the first place
29/03/2020, 17:18 - David;: So then there would be spike in transmission, pressure on NHS, ICU units overwhelmed etc.
29/03/2020, 17:19 - / James Ball: so the only solution in that scenario is to eradicate in the wild
29/03/2020, 17:20 - / James Ball: or some kind of postcode lottery (aka the meat raffle) for release and infection
29/03/2020, 17:20 - Paul;: Yes do that
29/03/2020, 17:20 - Paul;: The raffle
29/03/2020, 17:20 - David;: So causality: 1) antibody test developed; 2) people who haven't had covid and not vulnerable want to get it to pass test and be let out; 3) these people tranmit to others, including vulnerable; 4) pressure on NHS and overwhelmed; 5) high mortality
29/03/2020, 17:20 - Paul;: District 7 is allowed out for the week etc etc
29/03/2020, 17:21 - / James Ball: allowed out but *enforced* exposure to the virus in that time
29/03/2020, 17:22 - David;: How do you mean?
29/03/2020, 17:23 - / James Ball: everyone quarantined until all cases are resolved world wide
29/03/2020, 17:24 - Phill: Or just get a vaccine.
29/03/2020, 17:24 - / James Ball: >18 months
29/03/2020, 17:24 - David;: Enjoy the 18 month lockdown
29/03/2020, 17:24 - Phill: It's mutating slowly which is good
29/03/2020, 17:25 - Phill: Nah. This is impacting on huge western economies. This will happen in 3 months.
29/03/2020, 17:25 - Phill: It's not African virus where no one with the ability to pump into a vaccine gives a shit
29/03/2020, 17:25 - David;: The you're facing mass death
29/03/2020, 17:26 - David;: Oh you think vaccine is 3 months away? Well no one who knows about it is saying that
29/03/2020, 17:26 - David;: Even with fast tracking, you have to trial it loads and then get to industrial scale production
29/03/2020, 17:26 - David;: It's all johnned
29/03/2020, 17:26 - Phill: It's 3 months. We vaccine now.
29/03/2020, 17:26 - Phill: >trial
29/03/2020, 17:27 - Phill: Just trial it on the population
29/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: greater than 60% effectiveness vaccine will be difficult
29/03/2020, 17:27 - David;: Lol but not even for safety reasons for efficacy reasons
29/03/2020, 17:27 - Phill: Some efficacy better than none
29/03/2020, 17:27 - Phill: Just dampens the shitting down a bit
29/03/2020, 17:27 - David;: But then you could be devoting resources to a drug that's utter shit
29/03/2020, 17:27 - / James Ball: but then resources wasted instead of waiting for higher efficacy
29/03/2020, 17:27 - David;: Yeah
29/03/2020, 17:28 - Phill: When you say resources you mean bunce. No one gives a shit about bunce right now.
29/03/2020, 17:28 - Phill: Bunce is out.
29/03/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: man power
29/03/2020, 17:28 - Phill: Old news.
29/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: Yeah there's hard constraints on trained people labs etc. Even with unlimited bunce
29/03/2020, 17:29 - Phill: Science teachers. They not doing anything right now.
29/03/2020, 17:29 - David;: Seems like these antimalarial drugs could be a stopgap. Reduce symptoms.
29/03/2020, 17:30 - / James Ball: I'm pretty sure that every lab that can is already working on a vaccine though
29/03/2020, 17:30 - David;: So we let Mrs Tagavi play around with a Bunsen burner and lithium for a few days and just shove whatever she comes up with into large scale industrial production?
29/03/2020, 17:31 - Paul;: Just comes up with a few things to shove up your arse
29/03/2020, 17:31 - / James Ball: maybe we have a resonably effective trail drug after 9 months
29/03/2020, 17:31 - Paul;: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/27/uk-scientists-enrol-volunteers-for-coronavirus-vaccine-trial
29/03/2020, 17:31 - Paul;: James, volunteer for us so we can go out sooner
29/03/2020, 17:31 - / James Ball: lol nah
29/03/2020, 17:32 - Stefan;: They also have to be tested for safety on a large scale and over a long period
29/03/2020, 17:32 - Paul;: Surely scrap doing that
29/03/2020, 17:32 - Paul;: Push it through quick. Worry about side effects later
29/03/2020, 17:32 - / James Ball: ah, my mate's lab again
29/03/2020, 17:33 - Paul;: We all become the elephant man but at least we can go outside
29/03/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: Vaccine safety is big for this virus, as part of the symptoms are due to your own immune response, so it you mass produce a vaccine that produces a similar immune response in 1% of patients, you'll have spent money on making the problem worse
29/03/2020, 17:38 - Paul;: Lol that would be a big troll
29/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: but also the reason why the vaccine is so far off
29/03/2020, 17:39 - / James Ball: the people who die are predominantly those with an immune reaction as Rob says
29/03/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: So it’s a lot of luck of the draw as to what your immune system does
29/03/2020, 17:42 - Rob;: Only a guess as I've not read much about how it progresses, but perhaps shit immune systems have to work harder and throw more at the virus to clear it, but in doing so cause massive inflammation in affected tissue
29/03/2020, 17:42 - / James Ball: well if you have a worse immune system to begin with the virus is able to progress further to the point of triggering the immunoresponse

29/03/2020, 18:09 - Rob;: I think the fact that they've got on top of it will show people that it's down to their own government's handling of it
29/03/2020, 18:09 - Paul;: Eh?
29/03/2020, 18:10 - Paul;: Everyone is hating China
29/03/2020, 18:10 - Rob;: As in, how bad it's got in Italy and Spain is more down to their own handling of it, more than China being to blame
29/03/2020, 18:10 - Rob;: But yeah, people will probably hate china
29/03/2020, 18:11 - Paul;: No I think people will look to blame China
29/03/2020, 18:14 - Stefan;: The Chinese govt can be blamed to some extent, for their initial cover-up and denial

30/03/2020, 09:13 - Paul;: The virus has been found in the faeces of as many as 53% of hospitalised people and more anal swab positives have been found than oral swab positives in the later stages of infection.[51] The virus was found in faeces from 1 to 12 days and 17% of patients continued to present the virus in faeces after no longer presenting them in respiratory samples, indicating that the viral gastrointestinal infection and the potential fecal-oral transmission can last even after viral clearance in the respiratory tract. Reoccurrence of the virus has also been detected through anal swabs suggesting a shift from more oral positive during the early stages of the disease to more anal positive during later periods.
30/03/2020, 09:14 - Phill: Should probably stop eating other people's shit then.

30/03/2020, 09:42 - Rob;: Yeah, there are two types of vaccine, and the one that can make people shit virus from time to time is used a lot, I think because jt's far cheaper
30/03/2020, 09:43 - Rob;: Overall effect is less polio, except if you live in a village where someone is shitting it everywhere

30/03/2020, 14:24 - David;: I've managed to get into a very shit situation. My tenants in Leam moved out giving no notice to return to Poland because they were worried about the border closures. That happened 1 week before the lock down so now can't get new tenants in. Not can we ourselves move back to Leam to live rent free over the summer which we were thinking about. So locked into paying rent here with no rental income
30/03/2020, 14:25 - David;: *nor
30/03/2020, 14:25 - Rob;: You could feasibly move

30/03/2020, 14:29 - David;: More that i doubt we could hire a van now. Think rental car companies will be closed. And you are technically not allowed to move houses.

30/03/2020, 14:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Why dont you cancel Edinburgh and both move down?
30/03/2020, 14:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Or does fay have to be close to sterling?
30/03/2020, 14:43 - David;: But would save us a money coming back for a few months. It might make sense if we could get new tenants in Leam and save the ball ache

30/03/2020, 14:43 - David;: No it's all remote now
30/03/2020, 14:43 - Phill: Put an ad out for cheaper rent for furloughed people.

30/03/2020, 14:44 - David;: But den cheaper doe
30/03/2020, 14:44 - David;: Less bunce, and we'd be paying full whack up here.
30/03/2020, 14:44 - Phill: But think of the moving costs.
30/03/2020, 14:45 - David;: Yeah but there's already a differential just from Edinburgh being a nicer place and this is a nicer flat and the council tax is mental up here.
30/03/2020, 14:45 - David;: so would still save bunce to move.
30/03/2020, 14:45 - Phill: Yeah
30/03/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: The thing that's fucked us is that we'd planned to buy furniture after the move, then shops closed and some orders cancelled. Actually physically moving was fine, but only a 30 mins drive so returning a Zip van was fine

30/03/2020, 14:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Point 6(2)L
30/03/2020, 14:47 - David;: Furniture is fine, it's just we have 2 big bookshelves we bought up here we need to lug down so would need a fairly large van.
30/03/2020, 14:47 - Rob;: Is storage open? Could store the big stuff and just car down?
30/03/2020, 14:50 - David;: Interesting. Definitely hasn't been made clear.

30/03/2020, 15:19 - / James Ball: charles not ded
30/03/2020, 15:19 - / James Ball: best option is big van and do it all in one
30/03/2020, 15:23 - David;: Yeah. It seems enterprise rental is still operating as normal. This has potential. Get it done in one shitty swoop.
30/03/2020, 15:23 - / James Ball: I just hired a luton van for my house move
30/03/2020, 15:24 - / James Ball: tail lift 👌🏼
30/03/2020, 15:24 - David;: Actually still getting tenants interested having put it up in spareroom this morning so things not looking as shit as they fucked be.
30/03/2020, 15:24 - David;: Lol everyone is moving during this
30/03/2020, 15:24 - / James Ball: at least you have income for the time being though, I'm paying rent with nothing until June
30/03/2020, 15:24 - David;: Where are you moving?
30/03/2020, 15:24 - / James Ball: Moved at the end of Feb
30/03/2020, 15:25 - / James Ball: Stanton Harcourt, in between Witney/Eynsham/Oxford

30/03/2020, 15:26 - David;: Can't furnish, won't furnish
30/03/2020, 15:27 - David;: Do you need furniture really? Put a bit of straw down. Craft a sofa from cardboard boxes?
30/03/2020, 15:29 - Rob;: Ikea and John Lewis are doing deliveries for now
30/03/2020, 15:29 - Rob;: I've been promised a table and chairs today. No more working on the floor for me
30/03/2020, 15:30 - Rob;: Only DFS have completely Johnned us. Paid for sofa that's now indefinitely in their warehouse
30/03/2020, 15:32 - Rob;: Hamish, let's see your house. Did you buy?

30/03/2020, 15:37 - Paul;: rob wins the lockdown
30/03/2020, 15:38 - Rob;: Ah, more lockdown? For me?
30/03/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: Good that it's stayed under 200 two days in a row
30/03/2020, 15:40 - Rob;: Just England apparently
30/03/2020, 15:40 - Rob;: 180 in UK apparently
30/03/2020, 15:41 - David;: It feels hollow either way. If it's low it makes the response feel disproportionate and futile. If it's high it's hundreds more dead.
30/03/2020, 15:41 - David;: It's lose-lose
30/03/2020, 15:41 - David;: Nice. Is bernie loving the space? Where's his box?

30/03/2020, 16:26 - / James Ball: had no where to spit it out and had to continue to hold tube
30/03/2020, 16:26 - Sam;: Lol
30/03/2020, 16:26 - Paul;: consuming sludge and yeast against your will
30/03/2020, 16:27 - Paul;: but also not against your will
30/03/2020, 16:28 - / James Ball: beer is good though. probably about 3.5%, malty

30/03/2020, 18:13 - Damian Rumble: Here's this for a sweep stake. Total number of deaths in Italy and the UK by the end of April? Anyone care to start?
30/03/2020, 18:21 - Stefan;: Latest government line: no test is better than a bad test
30/03/2020, 18:23 - Paul;: Why not get a good test?
30/03/2020, 19:04 - David;: Stefan is Raab still a big gay icon?
30/03/2020, 19:36 - Stefan;: Sort of - he's very controversial
30/03/2020, 19:37 - Stefan;: Most who find him attractive hate themselves for it because he's so vile

30/03/2020, 19:56 - Phill: Wonder what it is about Asda specifically which means he can tolerate it say compared to a Tesco nug?
30/03/2020, 20:01 - Paul;: Only eats nugs?

31/03/2020, 09:38 - Damian Rumble: Nah they are thinking about cancelling or having a very short season
31/03/2020, 09:39 - Damian Rumble: Which I'm pretty ok with. Its widely thought Hamilton will have the fastest car again and will romp home again. There are big rule changes coming in 2021 to mix things up
31/03/2020, 09:40 - Rob;: New 2021 rule is that F1 is banned
31/03/2020, 09:40 - Rob;: Will really mix it up
31/03/2020, 09:42 - Phill: They should get rid of the  teams and just have stock F1 cars for every driver, produced by one team. Would really show who the best drivers are rather than *duut duut, muh mercedes go fast, turn left*
31/03/2020, 09:46 - David;: Yeah been thinking this for years.
31/03/2020, 09:46 - David;: The glaring obvious problem with F1 that kills any spectacle.
31/03/2020, 10:10 - Paul;: why do they not do that damo?
31/03/2020, 10:22 - / James Ball: just change it so they all have to drive a 1998 ford mondeo
31/03/2020, 10:22 - Rob;: Someone should work out a safe way to make F1 as much like mario kart as possible
31/03/2020, 10:23 - Rob;: Lightning, mushrooms, invincible stars
31/03/2020, 10:23 - Sam;: F1 has also had a history of being an engineering competition as well as a racing one. Hence the constructors title as the individual racing championship
31/03/2020, 10:23 - Sam;: *has always had
31/03/2020, 10:43 - Damian Rumble: They do it's called formula Renault. No one cares about it
31/03/2020, 10:44 - Damian Rumble: This
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Phill: Why do the cars not get paid damo? The driver is merely a passenger, yet he gets all the glory?
31/03/2020, 10:54 - Phill: Smh
31/03/2020, 10:56 - Paul;: should do autonomous racing and cheer an algorithm - hamilton bot wins again with the same consistent lap time as all the previous 49
31/03/2020, 10:59 - Jack G;: The engineers get paid...

31/03/2020, 12:41 - Paul;: expect India will get mega fucked. if they misinterpret cheering from balconies to having a street gathering what hope is there. Also whenever i'm on a plane and poeple stand up while it's still taxiing ignoring instructions there was always a 90% chance they were Indian

31/03/2020, 20:14 - Sam;: New series of Sunderland till I die comes out tomorrow
31/03/2020, 20:15 - David;: Doesn't account for all £1.2m. Also 400,000 residential landlines cancelled.

31/03/2020, 20:15 - Paul;: 3,0004

31/03/2020, 20:16 - Paul;: That’s just a fact. That’s at least 400k dead
31/03/2020, 20:20 - Phill: 400k in a population of 1bn is fuck all.
31/03/2020, 20:20 - Phill: 0.05%
31/03/2020, 20:21 - Phill: I'd be surprised if death rate wasn't more
31/03/2020, 20:22 - Phill: Carol definitely killed Don.
31/03/2020, 20:23 - David;: Lot more than 3,000 though

01/04/2020, 15:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Might depend how deaths are recorded, often requires doctors to complete death certificates which isnt done at weekends, this might just be the backlog from the weekend

01/04/2020, 16:53 - David;: 1) most of the deaths being reported are not caused by coronavirus. Possibly only 12% of them are.
2) 15,000 excess deaths from flu per year anyway
3) the measures may only save a few tens of thousands of excess deaths
4) the economic impact of this will shorten lives and cause more early deaths than are saved by stopping corona
01/04/2020, 16:54 - / James Ball: excess deaths still very fluid though
01/04/2020, 16:54 - / James Ball: not enough data to prove they died purely from covid-19
01/04/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: Lockdown could be useful if used to expand NHS capacity enough to cope without lockdown
01/04/2020, 16:55 - Rob;: If that's actuallypossible
01/04/2020, 16:55 - Paul;: Is it a case of this person died it must be coronavirus - now it's a hot topic it's easy to attribute an otherwise unexplained death to it
01/04/2020, 16:55 - Jack G;: So what I’m hearing is the herd is the best option
01/04/2020, 16:55 - / James Ball: but is NHS capacity being used up by people that would normall just get flu and die at home
01/04/2020, 16:55 - Jack G;: Overall
01/04/2020, 16:55 - Paul;: yeah always herd
01/04/2020, 16:56 - Paul;: the herd. been a fan of it from day 1
01/04/2020, 16:56 - David;: No it's more like this person was going to die within a few months of another serious disease. They happened to also get coronavirus, and so it gets classes as a coronavirus death
01/04/2020, 16:57 - David;: Or, they do die of corona technically but this has just dragged when they were going to die forward a few months
01/04/2020, 16:57 - Paul;: ah
01/04/2020, 16:58 - Paul;: 10% of people aged 80+ die each year anyway it also said
01/04/2020, 16:58 - David;: Yeah. 'excess deaths' the key measure and that's far lower and possibly outweighed by deaths caused by lockdown
01/04/2020, 16:58 - David;: So that would be a John

01/04/2020, 17:13 - David;: 'hat does not mean there will be no extra deaths - but, Sir David says, there will be "a substantial overlap".

"Many people who die of Covid [the disease caused by coronavirus] would have died anyway within a short period," he says.

Knowing exactly how many is impossible to tell at this stage.

Prof Neil Ferguson, the lead modeller at Imperial College London, has suggested it could be up to two-thirds.'
01/04/2020, 17:13 - David;: Wasn't that quite key information about that model?
01/04/2020, 17:13 - Paul;: lol

01/04/2020, 20:24 - Paul;: Lol just breaks this out
01/04/2020, 20:25 - Paul;: Best thing is it doesn’t feel as awkward as the Anne Frank meme being sent. Still the defining moment of the locky so far
01/04/2020, 20:33 - David;: But there’s another, potentially even more serious problem: the way that deaths are recorded. If someone dies of a respiratory infection in the UK, the specific cause of the infection is not usually recorded, unless the illness is a rare ‘notifiable disease’. So the vast majority of respiratory deaths in the UK are recorded as bronchopneumonia, pneumonia, old age or a similar designation. We don’t really test for flu, or other seasonal infections. If the patient has, say, cancer, motor neurone disease or another serious disease, this will be recorded as the cause of death, even if the final illness was a respiratory infection. This means UK certifications normally under-record deaths due to respiratory infections.

Now look at what has happened since the emergence of Covid-19. The list of notifiable diseases has been updated. This list — as well as containing smallpox (which has been extinct for many years) and conditions such as anthrax, brucellosis, plague and rabies (which most UK doctors will never see in their entire careers) — has now been amended to include Covid-19. But not flu. That means every positive test for Covid-19 must be notified, in a way that it just would not be for flu or most other infections.

In the current climate, anyone with a positive test for Covid-19 will certainly be known to clinical staff looking after them: if any of these patients dies, staff will have to record the Covid-19 designation on the death certificate — contrary to usual practice for most infections of this kind. There is a big difference between Covid-19 causing death, and Covid-19 being found in someone who died of other causes. Making Covid-19 notifiable might give the appearance of it causing increasing numbers of deaths, whether this is true or not. It might appear far more of a killer than flu, simply because of the way deaths are recorded.
01/04/2020, 20:34 - David;: If we take drastic measures to reduce the incidence of Covid-19, it follows that the deaths will also go down. We risk being convinced that we have averted something that was never really going to be as severe as we feared. This unusual way of reporting Covid-19 deaths explains the clear finding that most of its victims have underlying conditions — and would normally be susceptible to other seasonal viruses, which are virtually never recorded as a specific cause of death.
01/04/2020, 20:34 - David;: Hamish thoughts?
01/04/2020, 20:43 - David;: Let us also consider the Covid-19 graphs, showing an exponential rise in cases — and deaths. They can look alarming. But if we tracked flu or other seasonal viruses in the same way, we would also see an exponential increase. We would also see some countries behind others, and striking fatality rates. The United States Centers for Disease Control, for example, publishes weekly estimates of flu cases. The latest figures show that since September, flu has infected 38 million Americans, hospitalised 390,000 and killed 23,000. This does not cause public alarm because flu is familiar.
01/04/2020, 20:45 - David;: One pretty clear indicator is death. If a new infection is causing many extra people to die (as opposed to an infection present in people who would have died anyway) then it will cause an increase in the overall death rate. But we have yet to see any statistical evidence for excess deaths, in any part of the world.
01/04/2020, 20:45 - Paul;: What’s the source on this?
01/04/2020, 20:45 - David;: Much of the response to Covid-19 seems explained by the fact that we are watching this virus in a way that no virus has been watched before. The scenes from the Italian hospitals have been shocking, and make for grim television. But television is not science.
01/04/2020, 20:49 - David;: Spectator article
01/04/2020, 20:50 - David;: 'John Lee is a recently retired professor of pathology and a former NHS consultant pathologist' apparently
01/04/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: So they’ve johnned it
01/04/2020, 20:51 - David;: https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/The-evidence-on-Covid-19-is-not-as-clear-as-we-think/amp
01/04/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: The big figure will be if the annual expected death rate goes up
01/04/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: But then they’ll just say the locky was effective
01/04/2020, 20:52 - David;: The moral debate is not lives vs money. It is lives vs lives. It will take months, perhaps years, if ever, before we can assess the wider implications of what we are doing. The damage to children’s education, the excess suicides, the increase in mental health problems, the taking away of resources from other health problems that we were dealing with effectively. Those who need medical help now but won’t seek it, or might not be offered it. And what about the effects on food production and global commerce, that will have unquantifiable consequences for people of all ages, perhaps especially in developing economies?
01/04/2020, 20:52 - David;: I'm beginning to suspect they might have johnned it.
01/04/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Lol but they’d have thought about this?
01/04/2020, 20:53 - Paul;: We’re getting no excess deaths anywhere?
01/04/2020, 20:54 - David;: But maybe we're like the German soldiers after WW1 who thought the generals had betrayed them and voted for Hitler? The betrayal myth
01/04/2020, 20:57 - Rob;: We have a couple of friends down the road who stopped by for a doorway chat today. Ones a police officer. He booked some people for kidnapping a person with downs synsome last night. He also did them with the Corona act on top for getting withing 2 metres
01/04/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: >did them
01/04/2020, 20:59 - David;: Seems like the first crime is more serious?
01/04/2020, 20:59 - David;: No need to also invoke the 2m rule
01/04/2020, 21:00 - Paul;: So in fact Iran has actually been recording deaths correctly as you’d expect
01/04/2020, 21:00 - David;: I arrested a guy for driving with a headlight blown. I also arrested him for mass homicide
01/04/2020, 21:00 - Paul;: Just a generic background death
01/04/2020, 21:00 - Rob;: He said he just wanted to punish them for whatever he could as it was such a horrible crime

01/04/2020, 22:50 - David;: Gets huge though lots of good places to froust
02/04/2020, 08:11 - / James Ball: so. currently since our first recorded covid death, roughly 36,080 people "should" have died in the UK. The 2352 covid associated deaths account for 6.5% of that
02/04/2020, 08:12 - Phill: But are they additional deaths?
02/04/2020, 08:13 - / James Ball: that's the difficult part to unravel
02/04/2020, 08:13 - / James Ball: I'd guess a lower proportion of that is then additional
02/04/2020, 08:36 - Rob;: UK 410 Italy 710

Italy 689
02/04/2020, 08:37 - Rob;: Has anyone watched the Trip to Greece yet?
02/04/2020, 08:41 - Damian Rumble: There was that study from Italy a couple of weeks ago that found that 99.2% of all Corona deaths had under lying health conditions. So likely alot of these people would have been amongst the annual death toll any way
02/04/2020, 08:41 - Paul;: italy: 800
02/04/2020, 08:41 - Paul;: uk: 450
02/04/2020, 08:42 - Jack G;: Italy 830. UK 600
02/04/2020, 08:46 - Damian Rumble: I guess the four options for world leaders are....

Do nothing, smaller number of deaths - largely get blamed for those deaths and doing nothing

Do nothing, large of deaths - much more severely blamed for those deaths and doing nothing

Do something and a large number of deaths - lots of suffering both medically and economically, but you can at least hold your hand up and say you tried, absolving you of summer responsibility

Do something and a small number of deaths - spin the outcome to appear as if your actions saved many lives to distract from the economic suffering

So clearly politically do something is a better option even though it may not be the right option
02/04/2020, 08:52 - Paul;: do you think due to the reaction of this pandemic suddenly we will have loads more pandemics as everyone becomes more cautious where as we've probably seen pandemics before but just not realised and put it down to a bad year for winter flu?
02/04/2020, 08:58 - Rob;: I wonder if when international travel opens up again if we'll see rapid transmission of new coughs and flus, as no one's had any exposure to strains that have evolved elsewhere
02/04/2020, 08:59 - Rob;: But I would think that the chances of a pandemic in this sense will remain the same as before, increasing in line with the human population
02/04/2020, 08:59 - Paul;: always should have just stuck with the herd
02/04/2020, 09:00 - Rob;: If we could just stop fucking around with animals so much, for food, medicine, material and trade, the chances of a pandemic would be slashed
02/04/2020, 09:01 - Paul;: when you start messing with something as ridiculous looking as a pangolin you are asking for it

02/04/2020, 11:15 - Paul;: we also have to do another clap for the NHS tonight
02/04/2020, 11:16 - Paul;: every thursday at 8pm there's now a state mandated clapping
02/04/2020, 11:35 - David;: What annoys me more is the rise of click bait style titles on BBC
02/04/2020, 11:35 - David;: Headline should summarise the content succinctly
02/04/2020, 11:36 - David;: No headline should be phrased as a question
02/04/2020, 11:38 - Rob;: I read a thing about how they do that a while ago. They serve different headlines to different users initially and guage which one gets most interaction, which obviously selected for incomplete headlines rather than informative ones
02/04/2020, 11:39 - Rob;: Very against the ethos of news journalism and more like tabloid or social media
02/04/2020, 11:44 - Paul;: yes, bbc sport recently started using teaser headlines all over facebook full of emojis to get you to click. sick og it
02/04/2020, 11:44 - Paul;: *of
02/04/2020, 11:44 - Paul;: lots of use of 😅💪🔥
02/04/2020, 11:47 - Rob;: This is how we get old. The emoji will become normal to everyone younger and we'll just be dicks
02/04/2020, 11:48 - Rob;: You find it in all the grammar books I've read for subbing. Old people objecting to things that are just normal. Like  'target' as a verb. Obviously fine. Winds some people up.
02/04/2020, 11:49 - Damian Rumble: We do this as well. It's called a  multi armed bandit problem.
02/04/2020, 11:52 - Rob;: I can see why it's used, but if every single bit of copy on a front page is chosen that way you lose all editorial discretion and balance. You can't let the robots have everything.
02/04/2020, 12:01 - David;: This does annoy me as well. Managerial bollocks.
02/04/2020, 12:02 - David;: >nowTV. Who has that?
02/04/2020, 12:02 - Rob;: You can get a free trial often
02/04/2020, 12:02 - David;: Do I need to subscribe?
02/04/2020, 12:02 - Rob;: Good for prem games mate
02/04/2020, 12:02 - Paul;: i had now tv
02/04/2020, 12:03 - Rob;: It's just sky's subscription service
02/04/2020, 12:03 - Rob;: Good for movies
02/04/2020, 12:03 - David;: What? Sky is sky's subscription service
02/04/2020, 12:03 - David;: Sky is a subscription service
02/04/2020, 12:03 - Paul;: dinosaur dave
02/04/2020, 12:04 - Sam;: Now tv Non contract subby service
02/04/2020, 12:04 - Sam;: Sky tv is contract based and has live broadcast
02/04/2020, 12:04 - Sam;: This message was deleted
02/04/2020, 12:04 - Rob;: Get yourself a free month as a new customer Devid
02/04/2020, 12:05 - Sam;: And recording
02/04/2020, 12:05 - David;: Yeah but they will rope you in somehow.
02/04/2020, 12:05 - David;: Always strings attached
02/04/2020, 12:05 - David;: So nowtv is like Netflix but with sky content?
02/04/2020, 12:05 - David;: Is what I'm hearing
02/04/2020, 12:06 - David;: But then how can you watch the footy. Famously need that live
02/04/2020, 12:06 - Sam;: Yeah, but more expensive.
02/04/2020, 12:06 - Sam;: Footy is streamed but is cheaper than sky sports via satellite
02/04/2020, 12:06 - David;: Ah
02/04/2020, 12:06 - Damian Rumble: The dream...
02/04/2020, 12:07 - Rob;: You get a day pass for the footie and watch it live
02/04/2020, 12:08 - David;: This all seems very complicated and expensive
02/04/2020, 12:08 - Damian Rumble: Shameless plug but BT's new TV package allows you to get BT sport, Sky sports and Now TV all in the same place
02/04/2020, 12:08 - Phill: You can pay £29.99/month for a sky sports pass on Now TV. No contract. Cancel any time. All the sport. Same price as thru a satellite.
02/04/2020, 12:09 - Sam;: Very expensive,
02/04/2020, 12:09 - David;: Not much football streaming at the moment boi
02/04/2020, 12:10 - Sam;: Nah, my satellite sub is £18 a month.
02/04/2020, 12:10 - Hamish Sinclair: How much?
02/04/2020, 12:10 - Rob;: I got Sky 1 for no extra cost when I moved and got a newer Virgin media box. Quite pleased
02/04/2020, 12:11 - Sam;: Sky have let everyone pause sky sports sub till sport returns.
02/04/2020, 12:11 - Phill: But how much is your base package to allow to to sign up to Sky Sports?
02/04/2020, 12:12 - Sam;: The packages are all separate so you can pick and choose which ones you want. No mandatory base package
02/04/2020, 12:12 - Phill: Don't you have to be a subscriber to Sky?
02/04/2020, 12:12 - Phill: Like line rental
02/04/2020, 12:13 - Sam;: No, but they incentivise having sky internet as well.
02/04/2020, 12:15 - Sam;: Have to pay line rental for internet from any provider though right?
02/04/2020, 12:15 - Sam;: The price of doing business (internet)
02/04/2020, 12:18 - Damian Rumble: I think the all sports pack £40.
02/04/2020, 12:18 - Damian Rumble: I understand line rental is being abolished in the summer as well
02/04/2020, 12:19 - Sam;: Really, for BT customers or industry wide
02/04/2020, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: Industry wide. It's the government that is enforcing that
02/04/2020, 12:20 - Damian Rumble: I think
02/04/2020, 12:20 - Sam;: Noice.
02/04/2020, 12:21 - Rob;: I don't think I pay it currently. Not included in my bill breakdown
02/04/2020, 12:28 - David;: I just want to watch the trip to Greece
02/04/2020, 12:28 - Paul;: introductory offer they do - it'll kick in after 6 months or a year
02/04/2020, 12:28 - Rob;: Now TV, free month trial. Done
02/04/2020, 12:29 - Rob;: Ah, then I am now paying it then. Oh well. 200mb fibre.
02/04/2020, 12:30 - David;: No one needs that
02/04/2020, 12:31 - Rob;: It's not actually been fast enough over wi-fi to deal with my work files tbh
02/04/2020, 12:31 - Rob;: Everyone on shit broadband basically can't work
02/04/2020, 12:31 - David;: A 3GB film file in 15 seconds
02/04/2020, 12:32 - Rob;: They obviously don't really deliver that speed all the time. And VPN fucks the speed right in the arse
02/04/2020, 12:33 - David;: Yeah mine has gone to shit through the VPN. Almost impossible to work.
02/04/2020, 12:33 - Phill: Am I missing something here. When you used to have sky you used to pay:

£20/mo for the box, satellite, sky 1 and all the shit basic stuff. 

Then on top you payed £28 for sky sports. Without the former, you didn't have access to the later?
02/04/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: Do a speed test connected and one unconnected
02/04/2020, 12:33 - David;: Had to download everything and work on it locally working in the networked drives is a write off
02/04/2020, 12:34 - Rob;: This is now our protocol too. Has made every small change a 20 minute affair at least
02/04/2020, 13:35 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52131810
02/04/2020, 13:35 - David;: Paul thoughts?
02/04/2020, 13:35 - Paul;: is it really needed
02/04/2020, 13:36 - Paul;: just means people can create more social media content
02/04/2020, 13:37 - David;: Does it annoy you the BBC are reporting on their own radio social media campaign as if it's news?
02/04/2020, 13:38 - David;: A closed loop.
02/04/2020, 13:38 - David;: News represents news.
02/04/2020, 13:38 - Paul;: i can't get anywhere near it
02/04/2020, 13:39 - Paul;: i understand they mean well in the concept of it - i just disagree with it entirely and it's very embarrassing for all involved
02/04/2020, 13:42 - Paul;: A record 6.6 million Americans filed for unemployment benefits last week, official figures show.
02/04/2020, 13:43 - Paul;: unemployment almost at 10% in usa
02/04/2020, 14:10 - Paul;: UK: 569

02/04/2020, 14:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Would live this to go through that algorithm
02/04/2020, 14:51 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
02/04/2020, 14:57 - Paul;: @447770604623 how unnecessary is this speed?
02/04/2020, 15:12 - David;: Well have you ever really needed a 1GB file so badly that waiting more than 3 seconds for it would be a game changer
02/04/2020, 15:13 - David;: 5 seconds, forget it. A deal breaker.
02/04/2020, 15:22 - Paul;: when dial up first came out were you thinking we didn't need anything better
02/04/2020, 15:27 - Rob;: Also, speeds are just better now. They offer your good speed for the basic price.
02/04/2020, 15:31 - / James Ball: Streaming?
02/04/2020, 15:33 - David;: Unless you are planning to do some industrial scale file sharing or entering the HFT market I think 10-20mbs is plenty. But enjoy it.
02/04/2020, 15:34 - David;: May as well have 5hd TV streaming tabs open at any given time, just because you can
02/04/2020, 15:35 - / James Ball: 5Mb/s will barely keep Netflix ticking over at HD quality
02/04/2020, 15:37 - David;: weeeel
02/04/2020, 15:37 - / James Ball: 10Mb will probably be OK allowing for overheads and any other internet use at all
02/04/2020, 15:38 - / James Ball: Or how about this controversial notion - all internet is the same speed, just different connection width
02/04/2020, 15:38 - / James Ball: All the cars on the motorway are travelling at 70, there's just more lanes
02/04/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: Would rich people just bypass your attempt at equality by buying two lanes each?
02/04/2020, 15:39 - David;: True, if you have lots of people in a household then faster is important
02/04/2020, 15:39 - Phill: My 2mb does just fine thanks.
02/04/2020, 15:40 - David;: I have 20mbs just me and Fay and we use it pretty heavily, netflix, torrenting films, multiple tabs open etc. Never had a problem. However I also believe it is conditioned by the infrastructure of where you live to some extent?
02/04/2020, 15:40 - / James Ball: You actually can do this by bundling lines together
02/04/2020, 15:40 - David;: and factors like how far you are from the fibre box make a difference someone told me. Have no idea if thats true or not
02/04/2020, 15:41 - / James Ball: Yeah yeah. Connection bandwidth is definitely not the only metric to measure quality
02/04/2020, 15:41 - David;: Isn't this what net neutrality is about?
02/04/2020, 15:42 - David;: they also do traffic shaping, at peak times
02/04/2020, 15:42 - / James Ball: Net neutrality is more about control of data
02/04/2020, 15:42 - David;: so that would be a theoretical maximum that is almost never achieved I guess
02/04/2020, 15:43 - / James Ball: Yes, contention is the biggest issue in urban areas.
02/04/2020, 15:44 - David;: But doesnt that support the point that they are selling most people way in excess of what they need because it will be capped below that anyway?
02/04/2020, 15:44 - / James Ball: No because you can and will achieve the speed they are selling you
02/04/2020, 15:44 - / James Ball: Just when everyone is trying it once that it's not possible
02/04/2020, 15:44 - David;: Like if they sell you a 300mbs tariff or something but then shape that down to 50mbs in the busy evenings anyway, there is not a huge reason to have that tariff over a 50mbs tariff
02/04/2020, 15:45 - / James Ball: I would say a 5/6ths reduction in speed would be pretty major
02/04/2020, 15:46 - / James Ball: Traffic shaping is them analysing your data and slowing down things that take a lot of bandwidth (torrents, streaming)
02/04/2020, 15:47 - David;: I'd like to know whether they reduce it proportionally to your tariff or a generic cap. I.e. if the people on a 100mbs tariff are capped down to 50mbs are the people on 50mbs tariffs also at that or are they being shaped down to 25mbs
02/04/2020, 15:47 - / James Ball: Contention is just that there are a lot of people all trying to use the, let's say, 100Gbps pipe that feeds the green box on the street
02/04/2020, 15:47 - David;: Yeah, contention then
02/04/2020, 15:48 - David;: So when there is pressure on the overall line into the street are they doing anything to ensure that people on higher tariffs get a higher slice of that still
02/04/2020, 15:48 - / James Ball: Yes, in that case it would just proportionally affect everyone
02/04/2020, 15:50 - / James Ball: Also a faster connection means that you would saturate it for less time because your download finishes sooner
02/04/2020, 15:52 - David;: Hmm but surely if it is clogged with too much traffic this couldnt happen?
02/04/2020, 15:52 - David;: I.e. any gain for your speed is a loss somewhere else
02/04/2020, 15:54 - / James Ball: It's the same across the board with all distributed networks though. There's not enough power to supply every single house in the UK "full power" at once we rely on the fact that not everyone uses 100% of their service all the time
02/04/2020, 15:56 - David;: Yeah yeah. But my only point is about the alue of buying very fast tariffs where the infrastructure might not necessarily be able to provide it in any case
02/04/2020, 15:57 - David;: Basically, it's better to have fast tariffs sure but is it so much better to be worth the money given the limitations they place on it etc.
02/04/2020, 15:57 - / James Ball: There are also now laws in place to guarantee speeds
02/04/2020, 15:58 - / James Ball: Mine is technically unshaped and unlimited and right now I get actually a faster speed than I'm paying for 🤷🏻‍♂️
02/04/2020, 15:59 - / James Ball: We are a particularly backwards country for it too
02/04/2020, 15:59 - / James Ball: Very common in Spain to have 1Gb connection
02/04/2020, 16:00 - Rob;: We should at least make it so you can only advertise average speed
02/04/2020, 16:00 - David;: Yeah, or display a minimum speed as well as a maximum below which it will never drop
02/04/2020, 16:00 - Rob;: Perhaps localise it too. I used to hate it back in Chippy seeing adverts for internet you knew you could never have
02/04/2020, 16:00 - David;: I.e. give the full range not just peak
02/04/2020, 16:01 - / James Ball: You get literally this now
02/04/2020, 16:01 - / James Ball: When you sign up for a new connection
02/04/2020, 16:01 - Rob;: National levels mean nothing when you're plugging in down Glyme Lane
02/04/2020, 16:02 - / James Ball: True I've been very fortunate in my rural Gloucestershire house I got better internet than I ever got in Oxford. And yet Phil down the road was on 2002 levels of dial up
02/04/2020, 16:02 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
02/04/2020, 16:02 - David;: Yeah, regionally dissagregated and min-max range. Then I'm informed enough to make that purchase decision
02/04/2020, 16:03 - Paul;: it's an honest speed. salt of the earth
02/04/2020, 16:03 - Jack G;: Didn’t Thatcher block a government proposal in 1990 to upgrade the UKs copper network to a fibre infrastructure? We’d be so much better placed right now if she hadn’t
02/04/2020, 16:03 - / James Ball: Not bad for Rock Hill and on Wi-Fi
02/04/2020, 16:03 - / James Ball: Yep
02/04/2020, 16:04 - Jack G;: What a cunt
02/04/2020, 16:04 - / James Ball: Now trying to slowly thread fibre in everywhere
02/04/2020, 16:04 - Jack G;: Just in time for 5G to take over
02/04/2020, 16:05 - / James Ball: 5G towers will undoubtedly be fed by fibre
02/04/2020, 16:05 - / James Ball: Backbone has been fibre for a long time now
02/04/2020, 16:07 - Jack G;: Makes sense. Need this fibre network in properly then asap
02/04/2020, 16:11 - David;: Where there's a will there's Huawei

02/04/2020, 16:12 - Paul;: hebib
02/04/2020, 16:12 - / James Ball: Huawei probably already supplied the green box on your street

02/04/2020, 16:20 - Rob;: Little and Large
02/04/2020, 16:20 - Damian Rumble: Another 'cleb' biting the dust
02/04/2020, 16:20 - David;: I presume they changed their name? Wasn't just the best coincidence in comedy history
02/04/2020, 16:20 - David;: Or they met each other before getting into comedy and decided it was too good a name not to exploit
02/04/2020, 16:27 - Rob;: The Fish and Cushion sketch from Mitchell and Webb riffed on this

02/04/2020, 18:08 - Paul;: For a rainy day
02/04/2020, 18:08 - Rob;: Should I get it out of the recycling?

03/04/2020, 08:36 - Paul;: damian, mine us our data
03/04/2020, 09:00 - Paul;: when do we find out if we get an extendo on the locky?
03/04/2020, 09:06 - Phill: Probably 1AM the day before the locky is due to end
03/04/2020, 09:06 - Phill: Really fuck with us
03/04/2020, 09:10 - Paul;: ah, no antibody test still
03/04/2020, 09:10 - Paul;: none of them worked
03/04/2020, 09:45 - David;: Yes and lots of corona deaths would overlap with that total anyway
03/04/2020, 09:48 - David;: I.e. they are not all new deaths on top of that. Do feel the media has not communicated that at all
03/04/2020, 09:57 - / James Ball: I'd be interested to know how many young "healthy" people die from the flu

03/04/2020, 10:16 - Paul;: not just a symptom of breathing out?
03/04/2020, 10:16 - Phill: Probably.
03/04/2020, 10:33 - Phill: No vaccine they said.
03/04/2020, 10:33 - Phill: 18 months they said.

03/04/2020, 10:35 - Paul;: British American Tobacco also have a fast tract vaccine they could produce by June
03/04/2020, 10:38 - Phill: <Media omitted>
03/04/2020, 12:06 - Damian Rumble: The problem is not that there is no vaccine it's that it takes a long time to prove its success in human trials and productionsie it so it is cheap enough for the who world to get hold of sadly
03/04/2020, 12:46 - Stefan;: There has been a lot of discussion of this, but the prevailing view is that people have become incredibly horny in quarantine
03/04/2020, 12:47 - Stefan;: I.e. he's a 4/10 in normal times but a lockdown 8
03/04/2020, 12:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Bit rat-like for my taste
03/04/2020, 12:53 - Hamish Sinclair: But hes not a slightly pudgy, receding, pure middle class man

03/04/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: Have they assessed famine risk following on from covid?
03/04/2020, 14:32 - Rob;: We are Italy now
03/04/2020, 14:33 - Jack G;: It’s getting out of hand very quickly
03/04/2020, 14:33 - Rob;: 684
03/04/2020, 14:34 - Stefan;: Slightly more than Italy's death rate 2 weeks ago
03/04/2020, 14:49 - Paul;: definitely in for a locky extension
03/04/2020, 14:49 - Paul;: where's the figures of number currently in ICU vs capacity?
03/04/2020, 15:00 - Rob;: If that death to cases ratios estimate is correct the herd is now 3.3 million strongs
03/04/2020, 15:01 - Rob;: If it doubles every 3.5 days then in two weeks it's 26 million, and everyone within 3 weeks
03/04/2020, 15:01 - Rob;: I highly suspect that ratio will turn out to be bollocks
03/04/2020, 15:02 - Jack G;: Yeah. Effects of locky wont be one apparent until middle of next week?
03/04/2020, 15:04 - Rob;: I wonder if they'll ever be apparent as we don't really have many countries that didn't lock down to compare to
03/04/2020, 15:04 - Rob;: We'll get what everyone else got I think. Weekend of deaths in the high hundreds then a tail off
03/04/2020, 15:04 - Rob;: *weeks of, not weekend
03/04/2020, 15:05 - Stefan;: Sweden hasn't done a full lockdown
03/04/2020, 15:05 - Rob;: How are they doing?
03/04/2020, 15:13 - Stefan;: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/30/catastrophe-sweden-coronavirus-stoicism-lockdown-europe
03/04/2020, 15:13 - Stefan;: 6 times more deaths than Norway so far
03/04/2020, 15:15 - Rob;: Ok. Adds some weight to the lockdown side of things
03/04/2020, 15:56 - Damian Rumble: Not looking pretty good for us tbh

03/04/2020, 16:59 - Jack G;: Yeah very depressing. Also point Percy pigs as 3rd favourite food, dear god
03/04/2020, 16:59 - Rob;: Editing out Cunt from the names this time
03/04/2020, 17:14 - Damian Rumble: That's pretty embarrassing by all accounts...
03/04/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: It's obviously a lovely area to stay in. You just want to get out in the world enough to get Percy pigs off of the list
03/04/2020, 17:19 - Rob;: Which to be fair, you couldn't buy in Chippy until very recently, so she has been exploring the world to some extent
03/04/2020, 17:25 - Phill: Not as embarrassing as being a slave to a big insurance corporation and being bummed monthly by your landlord
03/04/2020, 17:44 - Jack G;: Lol

03/04/2020, 18:05 - Phill: Lol my PC is a potato and it runs wow fine
03/04/2020, 18:05 - Phill: It's such a piece of shit game graphically that you could run it off a phone
03/04/2020, 18:05 - Phill: Mirage Raceway EU Alliance
03/04/2020, 18:05 - Phill: I will start a new character and level with you
03/04/2020, 18:08 - Damian Rumble: Still preferable to playing WoW well into my 30s

03/04/2020, 22:24 - Phill: They're hiding many deaths.
03/04/2020, 22:27 - Damian Rumble: Awful. A real piece of shit
03/04/2020, 22:29 - Paul;: Assume we get at least one more month of lockdown then
03/04/2020, 22:29 - Phill: 2
03/04/2020, 22:31 - Rob;: Yeah the financial times team doing these graphs have caveated that they don't believe the Chinese figures
03/04/2020, 22:32 - Phill: South Korea also very full of shit and kimchi. Maybe kimchi is the cure.
03/04/2020, 22:32 - David;: Yeah hoffa
03/04/2020, 22:32 - David;: Cocksuckers
03/04/2020, 22:32 - Paul;: You charge a gun but run away from a knife
03/04/2020, 22:32 - David;: You charge a run, from a knife you run
03/04/2020, 22:32 - Rob;: But also make the point that both the measures and compliance in China have been stronger, so the other countries are probably still more fucked
03/04/2020, 22:32 - David;: *gun
03/04/2020, 22:33 - Paul;: Should have got the Oscar as Hoffa
03/04/2020, 22:33 - David;: It didn't apply to you
03/04/2020, 22:38 - David;: They've made a big Lebowski sequel/spin off
03/04/2020, 22:39 - Paul;: Sounds like a bad idea?

04/04/2020, 10:51 - Stefan;: It already is interesting
04/04/2020, 10:53 - Sam;: STARMER
04/04/2020, 10:58 - / James Ball: Starmer in. Big chin in.
04/04/2020, 10:59 - Damian Rumble: I approve
04/04/2020, 10:59 - Damian Rumble: But Corbyn in the bin
04/04/2020, 11:00 - Jack G;: Corbinned
04/04/2020, 11:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Shagger

04/04/2020, 11:09 - Rob;: What a weird time to come in
04/04/2020, 11:09 - Rob;: Corbyn inadvertently gave Starmer's limelight to the virus by staying on
04/04/2020, 12:03 - Damian Rumble: 56% pretty crushing victory
04/04/2020, 12:03 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
04/04/2020, 12:04 - Paul;: Will he get rid of momentum?
04/04/2020, 12:05 - Damian Rumble: But yeah... Not really any opportunity for the opposition to get much press coverage right now... But it may be a good time to quietly purge some of the more rapid Corbynistas from the party
04/04/2020, 12:19 - / James Ball: peak retard has yet to be reached sadly
04/04/2020, 12:53 - David;: Never put a fish in your car
04/04/2020, 12:56 - Paul;: Dereks idea for the prem: play the remainder of the season whenever it starts up again. Once that’s done start the next season only playing one game with a draw to see if home or away
04/04/2020, 12:57 - Jack G;: Would not be a fair competition
04/04/2020, 12:58 - David;: Elaborate
04/04/2020, 12:59 - Jack G;: Some teams would have an unfair advantage by getting easier fixtures at home
04/04/2020, 12:59 - Jack G;: So if Brighton play Watford at home and Liverpool away, that’s easier than let’s say if Watford play Brighton away and Liverpool at home
04/04/2020, 13:00 - David;: Thats the luck of a draw. We accept that principle for the FA and league cup?
04/04/2020, 13:00 - Paul;: Luck of the draw jack
04/04/2020, 13:00 - David;: Same for everyone
04/04/2020, 13:00 - Jack G;: It’s not a tournament. Couldn’t call it the premier league with these rules
04/04/2020, 13:00 - David;: Win your games Jack
04/04/2020, 13:01 - David;: Small club mentality is what I'm seeing here
04/04/2020, 13:01 - Jack G;: No, I just value the integrity of the game Dave, I guess being a LiVARpool fan you wouldn’t want that
04/04/2020, 13:01 - Paul;: Derek scoffed at jacks rebuttal
04/04/2020, 13:02 - Paul;: Said luck of the draw as well
04/04/2020, 13:02 - David;: The proper response
04/04/2020, 13:05 - Jack G;: If they did Derek’s suggestion but called it the premier trophy or some other shite name with a cup winner just so we have some football to carry us over until 2021/2022 season then fine. But this have a league season thing is bollocks
04/04/2020, 13:05 - Jack G;: Half a season*
04/04/2020, 13:07 - David;: What's your solution jack?
04/04/2020, 13:08 - David;: You're out in charge of the FA and premier league tomorrow. The clubs are waiting.
04/04/2020, 13:08 - David;: *put
04/04/2020, 13:09 - Jack G;: Finish the remainder of this season end of this year. 3 week pre season starting in September then the remainder of the games would take us to lets say just before Christmas. Then let’s do the euros in Feb/March then just a break until follow August 2021
04/04/2020, 13:10 - Paul;: Well done jack everyone is now bankrupt
04/04/2020, 13:11 - Jack G;: Along with a lot of other businesses in the world. Solutions would have to be thought of for that just as with any other sector. There’s plenty of money in football that can be redistributed accordingly
04/04/2020, 13:12 - Phill: Cancel FA cup and League cup next season and just make the games up that way
04/04/2020, 13:12 - Phill: A compressed season but 2 prem games a week
04/04/2020, 13:13 - Jack G;: Can get onboard with this. Although what about champions league?
04/04/2020, 13:16 - David;: Lose all domestic cups and the nation's league just focus on Europe and domestic leagues
04/04/2020, 13:31 - David;: Sneezing a lot. Can't have coronaviris
04/04/2020, 14:12 - / James Ball: The schneeb of life

04/04/2020, 20:32 - Damian Rumble: Your visceral hatred of kuenssberg, particularly in the context in the context of her right wing bias on the commentary of the labour party
04/04/2020, 20:34 - David;: I don't like kuenssberg she is intensely annoying, but this just seems a fairly bland set of truisms.
04/04/2020, 20:35 - David;: Starmer has to manage tension between moving away from corbynism but keeping membership inside. Coronavirus is both an opportunity for labour. Obvs.
04/04/2020, 20:37 - Sam;: STARMER will need both his legs and his haircut to win over voters
04/04/2020, 20:37 - David;: *challenge and opportunity
04/04/2020, 20:38 - Paul;: Lol
04/04/2020, 20:38 - David;: Shagger Starmer
04/04/2020, 20:38 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure how much there opportunity there is there for labour. The media spotlight is focused on the government and the opposition are very much out of the picture. Boris has made some mistakes/the problems in the NHS are laid bare but it is 5 long years until the next Genny so I am not sure how relevant Coronavirus will be then
04/04/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: Everyone always forgets once in a lifetime events...
04/04/2020, 20:41 - David;: Firstly the radical redesign of economic policy and conventional wisdom in the course of a month to accept a lot of what labour has been arguing for 10 years. Secondly opportunity to seem statesmanlike and behind the government in managing the crisis. Thirdly the sense of solidarity it has engendered.
04/04/2020, 20:41 - David;: Against that, yes Boris seeming like a Churchill style blitz figure and the lack of airtime they will get
04/04/2020, 20:41 - Damian Rumble: Even if by some miracle labour were to win a majority in 2024 then they would be saddled with debt from the years of recession and would be unable to really do anything meaningful (much like when Cameron came in in 2010)
04/04/2020, 20:42 - David;: I don't think they can cut through for the next 6 month or so while still in full crisis but it's important how they narrate the lessons learned and tap the zeitgeist in the period beyond that
04/04/2020, 20:43 - David;: (See Attlee et al., 1945)
04/04/2020, 20:47 - David;: Hopefully he uses this period to make the more controversial internal party management changes needed while no one is really noticing. Then will be better set up for the rest of the parliament.
04/04/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: This.

It's all they can really hope for now. Build up strength and at least shake off the corbyn ETA is much as they can.
04/04/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: era*
04/04/2020, 21:01 - David;: Corbyn ETA...still waiting.
04/04/2020, 21:01 - / James Ball: Lel
04/04/2020, 21:10 - / James Ball: He'll be here any second
04/04/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Ah the germ-fearing self isolationist giant baby in Spirited Away
04/04/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: A role model for us all
04/04/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: First time watching it?
04/04/2020, 21:42 - Rob;: Nah, but Julia's first
04/04/2020, 21:42 - Paul;: Huge film. Is she liking it?
04/04/2020, 21:42 - Rob;: Yeah loving it
04/04/2020, 21:42 - Rob;: I wanted to start with it but it wasn't on Netflix when we began
04/04/2020, 21:43 - Rob;: Castle in the Sky was a bit intense without the whimsy
04/04/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: Which ones have you gone through so far?
04/04/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: You will be needing to watch porco rosso. I imagine it’s what the film Casablanca is like if I ever watched it
04/04/2020, 21:44 - Rob;: Ha
04/04/2020, 21:44 - Rob;: I can't imagine that
04/04/2020, 21:44 - Rob;: Just this two with her
04/04/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: Line up porco rosso. No one else has seen it and I’m alone in my viewing
04/04/2020, 21:45 - Rob;: I've seen Totoro, Princess Mononoko and Howl's moving bungalow
04/04/2020, 21:45 - Paul;: The opening visuals. Perfect cinematography but a cartoon pig
04/04/2020, 21:46 - / James Ball: I've seen the recent one about planes. That's good
04/04/2020, 21:46 - / James Ball: Totoro
04/04/2020, 21:47 - / James Ball: The one about the witch
04/04/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: Would be good if that was the actual title
04/04/2020, 21:47 - / James Ball: Yeah yeah.
04/04/2020, 21:48 - / James Ball: Hal's moving to a new Council tenement I've only seen bits of
04/04/2020, 21:48 - Paul;: I need watch this one
04/04/2020, 21:48 - / James Ball: Totoro is surely the 80s classic
04/04/2020, 21:48 - Rob;: One of my favourites
04/04/2020, 21:49 - Paul;: Did anyone watch earthsea?
04/04/2020, 21:49 - Rob;: Ah I need to
04/04/2020, 21:49 - Rob;: Huge books
04/04/2020, 21:55 - / James Ball: Don't know it
04/04/2020, 21:55 - / James Ball: Not enough buzz to reach me
04/04/2020, 21:58 - Rob;: You should read the Dispossessed. Adult book by the same author
04/04/2020, 21:58 - Rob;: Space communism
04/04/2020, 22:09 - Damian Rumble: We watched princess mononke last night. Definitely going to bashing the rest of those films deep into the quarentine
04/04/2020, 22:17 - / James Ball: Your going to bash to the films?
04/04/2020, 22:23 - David;: None of them make the slightest bit of sense.
04/04/2020, 22:23 - David;: Seen princess mononoke, spirited away, moving cast, nausica, red turtle. There's no sense to any of it just an undifferentiated mass of stoned trippy imagery
04/04/2020, 22:24 - David;: *castle
04/04/2020, 22:24 - Rob;: David, she remembered she'd been inside Haku back when he was a river, and that allowed him to change form and stop doing evil. It makes perfect sense
04/04/2020, 22:26 - David;: You can't just have free word association plotting
04/04/2020, 22:26 - David;: Could not tell you the plot of any of them
04/04/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: Totoro: the big cat comes. The big cat goes.
04/04/2020, 22:27 - David;: No.
04/04/2020, 22:27 - Paul;: Watching Totoro now. So far no plot
04/04/2020, 22:27 - Paul;: Lots of whimsy
04/04/2020, 22:28 - Phill: I'm sorry? Princess Mononoke no plot you say?
04/04/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: Castle in the sky has a very linear plot for Gibli
04/04/2020, 22:28 - Phill: Nausicaa valley of the wind no plot you say?
04/04/2020, 22:29 - Phill: Grave of the Fireflies no plot says thee?
04/04/2020, 22:30 - David;: Also settling into totoro
04/04/2020, 22:30 - David;: Give it another chance
04/04/2020, 22:30 - David;: Might roll a joint
04/04/2020, 22:30 - Paul;: PODSU PODSU PODSU
04/04/2020, 22:31 - David;: Which one has PODSU?
04/04/2020, 22:31 - David;: Wait which one should I watch
04/04/2020, 22:31 - David;: Big decision could define the evening
04/04/2020, 22:31 - Paul;: Porco rosso
04/04/2020, 22:31 - David;: No
04/04/2020, 22:31 - David;: Apart from that
04/04/2020, 22:31 - Paul;: The crimson pig
04/04/2020, 22:31 - Phill: Have you seen Princess Mononoke from start to finish?
04/04/2020, 22:32 - David;: No I got stoned and sunk into a semi conscious coma
04/04/2020, 22:32 - David;: Like with most of them
04/04/2020, 22:32 - Paul;: Well that is a very good film
04/04/2020, 22:32 - David;: So princess mononoke vs nausica vs Totoro. Phil advise
04/04/2020, 22:33 - / James Ball: Just put the wind rises on
04/04/2020, 22:33 - David;: I essential know none of them despite having seen 2 of them my knowledge is equal
04/04/2020, 22:33 - / James Ball: Harriet not really seen any of them before
04/04/2020, 22:33 - Phill: Mononoke is the goat.
04/04/2020, 22:34 - David;: Above spirited?
04/04/2020, 22:34 - Phill: Yeah
04/04/2020, 22:34 - Phill: Same level of production value. Less mental story.n
04/04/2020, 22:37 - David;: Okay settling into mononoko. Rolling joint.
04/04/2020, 22:37 - David;: Does that have PODSU?
04/04/2020, 22:37 - Phill: No podsu in that
04/04/2020, 22:37 - David;: Where is PODSU?
04/04/2020, 22:37 - Phill: Laputa: Castle in the Sky
04/04/2020, 22:38 - David;: But you rate that lower than mononoko?
04/04/2020, 22:38 - Phill: Yeah but not much in it
04/04/2020, 22:38 - David;: Can I have your full ranking first to last of the Ghibli films
04/04/2020, 22:41 - Phill: 1. Princess Mononoke
2. Nausicaa Valley of the Wind
3. Spirited Away
4. Laputa 
5. How's moving Castle
6. Kikis Delivery service
7. My Neighbour Totoro
8. Arriety
9. Grave of the Fireflies
10. Arriety
04/04/2020, 22:41 - Phill: >arriety twice
04/04/2020, 22:41 - Phill: 8. Ponyo
04/04/2020, 22:43 - Phill: The cat returns also decent.
04/04/2020, 22:43 - Phill: 6-10 is flimsy.
04/04/2020, 22:44 - Paul;: Totoro lacks anything much happening. Lot of screaming so far
04/04/2020, 22:44 - David;: I'm watching mononoko. Done
04/04/2020, 22:45 - David;: Remember watching nausic at yours in year 10 and it being too mental to get close to
04/04/2020, 22:47 - David;: Which is the one with the weird cave spider with loads of arms?
04/04/2020, 22:48 - Paul;: Yeah that’s the one
04/04/2020, 22:48 - Paul;: They travel really fast across the desert
04/04/2020, 22:52 - David;: Nah but it's in a cave. A mechanical spider man with multiple arms
04/04/2020, 22:54 - Paul;: That’s spirited away
04/04/2020, 22:54 - Paul;: He’s in charge of stoking the fires
04/04/2020, 22:55 - Paul;: Obviously
04/04/2020, 22:55 - David;: Yeah yeah
04/04/2020, 22:55 - David;: That made absolutely no sense
04/04/2020, 22:57 - David;: 5 mins in I'm already dealing with a boar demon
04/04/2020, 23:14 - Damian Rumble: Good call
04/04/2020, 23:16 - Damian Rumble: Yeah you should probably get used to that.... The boars are pretty big
04/04/2020, 23:26 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
04/04/2020, 23:26 - Stefan;: My housemate is obsessed with ghibli and he mostly approves your top 10
04/04/2020, 23:27 - Stefan;: We're watching Laputa: castle in the sky
05/04/2020, 08:03 - Phill: So Dave, did you make it?
05/04/2020, 08:13 - Phill: Anyone playing any PC games at the moment? I want to bed into some multiplayer Anno 1800 if anyone has/is keen to get it
05/04/2020, 08:20 - Paul;: Can you stream your gameplay
05/04/2020, 08:21 - Phill: Not with my 1mb upload speed
05/04/2020, 08:31 - Paul;: I’m going to watch Nausicaa again today
05/04/2020, 08:31 - Paul;: See if I can find any PODSU type things
05/04/2020, 08:32 - Paul;: Get myself in a mental loop
05/04/2020, 08:32 - Phill: You need to get yourself blooted on weed first
05/04/2020, 08:33 - Paul;: Lol. How is the growing going?
05/04/2020, 08:34 - Phill: <Media omitted>
05/04/2020, 08:58 - Paul;: Damo I presume you’re out in the warm weather with a group playing throw disc? Extending our lockdown
05/04/2020, 09:18 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
05/04/2020, 09:19 - Paul;: @447969894197 can you put a painting through the painting algorithm. Put that one back through and see what it does
05/04/2020, 09:19 - Rob;: You could do that Paul
05/04/2020, 09:20 - Paul;: I need the link
05/04/2020, 09:21 - Rob;: For posterity, here is the painting link
05/04/2020, 09:25 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
05/04/2020, 09:25 - Paul;: It’s made it less sinister. Now looks to the left instead of your soul
05/04/2020, 09:26 - Phill: Put that one in
05/04/2020, 09:26 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
05/04/2020, 09:27 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
05/04/2020, 09:27 - Damian Rumble: Just like the rest of the sporting world. The entire frisbee season is cancelled. We should have been at a competition this weekend ☹️

05/04/2020, 09:40 - Rob;: Traces of Sam gone
05/04/2020, 09:50 - / James Ball: I thought you'd got fibre a while back?
05/04/2020, 09:58 - / James Ball: Looks like a blend between Paul and Jack
05/04/2020, 10:00 - Paul;: Paul, jack and the elephant man

05/04/2020, 10:19 - Phill: They need to do more groundworks as they put the pot in the wrong place
05/04/2020, 10:19 - Phill: And they haven't been out yet
05/04/2020, 10:19 - Phill: >we labour now
05/04/2020, 10:27 - David;: Can't deal with that

05/04/2020, 10:54 - David;: This was like when we were Google translating french news to English then to German then back to english
05/04/2020, 12:31 - Phill: Dave how did you find Princess Mononoke?
05/04/2020, 12:32 - Damian Rumble: You got to turn save media off for the thread
05/04/2020, 12:58 - / James Ball: Harriet liked the wind rises. Had no idea Ghibli was animated and well as Disney
05/04/2020, 13:37 - Sam;: This website is a good website
05/04/2020, 13:37 - Sam;: https://nextstrain.org/ncov

05/04/2020, 15:40 - / James Ball: Damo, why do you have to break the rules?
05/04/2020, 15:41 - / James Ball: Liberal elite in London fucking it for the rest of the country
05/04/2020, 15:52 - Phill: Yeah they're all scum.

05/04/2020, 19:21 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
05/04/2020, 19:25 - Rob;: Ah. But the sex workers. Social distancing not the headline
05/04/2020, 19:29 - / James Ball: yeah the story being social interaction not that he had an orgy
05/04/2020, 19:54 - Rob;: Perhaps he lives with the hookers. Then it would be fine
05/04/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: BJ in hospital
05/04/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: Boris not blowie
05/04/2020, 21:25 - Paul;: Blowie job in hospital
05/04/2020, 21:28 - Phill: It'll be a PR stunt
05/04/2020, 21:28 - Phill: He'll then come out declaring how shit the virus is and how dank the NHS is
05/04/2020, 21:29 - Phill: Also generates public sympathy etc
05/04/2020, 21:29 - Phill: This has Dominic cummings's grubby mitts all over it
05/04/2020, 21:30 - Hamish Sinclair: As if hes going to an nhs hospital
05/04/2020, 21:30 - Hamish Sinclair: If he is, it's a stunt
05/04/2020, 21:40 - / James Ball: just test
05/04/2020, 21:40 - / James Ball: s
05/04/2020, 21:40 - / James Ball: waste of time
05/04/2020, 21:40 - / James Ball: little sip of the old BJ piss bottle would have told them all they needed to know
05/04/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: got to keep cataloging that piss
05/04/2020, 21:49 - David;: We've done the tests - and they just keep saying 'you're a cunt'
05/04/2020, 21:49 - David;: We've never had anything like it before
05/04/2020, 21:50 - David;: Queen getting her grotty hand into the pie now as well
05/04/2020, 22:19 - Jack G;: Great way to get people to comply with the lockdown
06/04/2020, 07:12 - Phill: NHS hospital confirmed
06/04/2020, 08:43 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-52177586
06/04/2020, 08:51 - Paul;: A total of 138,913 deaths were registered in England and Wales between 28 December 2019 and 20 March 2020 (year to date), and of these, 108 involved COVID-19 (0.1%); including deaths that occurred up to 20 March but were registered up to 25 March, the number involving COVID-19 was 210.
06/04/2020, 08:52 - Paul;: imagine the hysteria of tracking daily deaths for everything
06/04/2020, 08:53 - Rob;: Yeah. You'd end up banning cars immediately
06/04/2020, 08:53 - Rob;: Then stairs
06/04/2020, 08:53 - Rob;: Banning suicide
06/04/2020, 08:53 - Paul;: although the betting market would be great and the following meat raffles would keep the population happy
06/04/2020, 09:13 - Paul;: "Residents destroy testing centre in Abidjan
Residents in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, have destroyed a coronavirus testing centre over fears it would pose a contagion risk for the people living nearby.

Videos show the building, which was still under conduction, being demolished by people shouting, "We don't want it".

An official from the health ministry said the site was never meant for the treatment of patients but only for testing."
06/04/2020, 09:13 - Paul;: ah
06/04/2020, 09:14 - Paul;: by that logic they should go around destroying hospitals
06/04/2020, 09:18 - / James Ball: I seem to remember you mentioning peak retard? Still a long way to go
06/04/2020, 09:18 - Rob;: It's all got so medieval
06/04/2020, 09:34 - David;: 1,600 people die on average every day normally in the UK. So corona deaths even now represent less than a third increase in that. If they were all new deaths. But then many are due to other conditions.
06/04/2020, 09:35 - David;: I do think a lot of this has to do with people not being able to grasp the scale of the human population and therefore the true significance of data like death stats.
06/04/2020, 09:40 - David;: Also the fact that old people have to die of something. Like the way people say there is an 'epidemic of dementia' - it's more that we've removed other bottlenecks to people getting old.
06/04/2020, 09:44 - Damian Rumble: One death is a tragedy. A million is a statistic.
06/04/2020, 09:46 - Rob;: Yeah, every person saved from one disease adds to the stats of another disease
06/04/2020, 09:46 - Rob;: We definitely need to rephrase disease reduction stats in terms of added years given
06/04/2020, 09:47 - David;: That's why the NHS use the QALY concept
06/04/2020, 09:47 - David;: But never see that reported
06/04/2020, 09:48 - Rob;: Yeah, that's not in disease charities press releases
06/04/2020, 09:48 - David;: QALY loss from corona would be small given the profile of the people it kills
06/04/2020, 09:50 - Hamish Sinclair: A reasonable amount of 60year olds coming into  ITU with minor comorbidities (type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure etc) would expect alot of these to comfortably live another 15-20yeara
06/04/2020, 09:51 - David;: Yeah true
06/04/2020, 09:52 - David;: But still would like some analysis of life expectancy or years lost as well as raw death numbers. It seems to make some non-trivial difference to how we should think about the scale of what's happening.
06/04/2020, 09:54 - David;: That's not to say we shouldnt worry about corona or do as much as we can to deal with it and put lots of resources towards it, but is shutting down the entire country an appropriate response. It might be, but it's quite a complicated question.
06/04/2020, 09:54 - Hamish Sinclair: Will be interesting to apply the same metric to the Coronavirus that NICE uses to judge funding for drug treatments - essentially cost per QUALY
06/04/2020, 09:54 - David;: yes, that's what I want essentially.
06/04/2020, 09:55 - David;: £/QUALY for the corona response.
06/04/2020, 09:56 - Rob;: Politics is fucking this isn't it. Every corona death = result of political decisions, in a way that no other death from disease is
06/04/2020, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: Would need a control group/country where we do nothing and let it run rampent
06/04/2020, 09:57 - David;: Sweden?
06/04/2020, 09:57 - Rob;: And Belarus
06/04/2020, 09:57 - David;: Funny that those guys are now the renegade mavericks. Don't associate that with the Swedes
06/04/2020, 09:57 - Hamish Sinclair: But difficult to prove exposure
06/04/2020, 09:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Youd need two countries with similar initial exposure rates and then randomized strategies
06/04/2020, 09:58 - David;: Could use the do nothing modelling scenario as the control to compare with maybe. Although that's subject to a lot of assumptions and wide uncertainty margins.
06/04/2020, 10:01 - David;: https://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Focusing+Effect
06/04/2020, 10:02 - David;: Think it's more this
06/04/2020, 10:05 - Hamish Sinclair: Just realise they kept Johnson in overnight, which means he must be requiring oxygen
06/04/2020, 10:05 - David;: ah really?
06/04/2020, 10:05 - David;: They kept that pretty quiet
06/04/2020, 10:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Reading between the lines. Theres not really any other reason to keep him in otherwise
06/04/2020, 10:08 - Hamish Sinclair: Perhaps admission criteria are slightly more relaxed if you're the PM though
06/04/2020, 10:23 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
06/04/2020, 10:29 - / James Ball: Lol. Why have?
06/04/2020, 10:32 - Paul;: one of my chinese suppliers sent them to me
06/04/2020, 10:32 - Paul;: the care package
06/04/2020, 10:32 - / James Ball: Yes was reading a lot on this last night. As you say there's not a lot routine about a 9pm on Sunday hospital admission. Although the destabilising effects of Johnson's death and just general medical attention for a head of state is likely meaning he gets admitted much more readily
06/04/2020, 10:33 - Paul;: the scottish chief medical officer who rekt herself
06/04/2020, 10:33 - Paul;: tootling around to her second home amid lockdown
06/04/2020, 10:34 - Rob;: Twice. Actually got fined
06/04/2020, 10:43 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
06/04/2020, 10:47 - Rob;: Yeah, fucking LinkedIn wankers
06/04/2020, 10:48 - Rob;: Definitely all childless people with either unimpacted incomes or savings
06/04/2020, 10:50 - / James Ball: Ah. Just had email from bank. My savings accounts have been cut to 0.01% interest
06/04/2020, 10:51 - Paul;: lol excellent
06/04/2020, 10:52 - Paul;: the glory days of 6% interest - i found some old statements before the 08 crash of my savings ISA
06/04/2020, 10:52 - / James Ball: They were at about 0.5 before for reference
06/04/2020, 10:52 - Paul;: i think it was around 6.75% with that icelandic bank
06/04/2020, 10:53 - Rob;: Yeah I can remember being pissed off only getting 5%
06/04/2020, 10:53 - / James Ball: Yeah, the glory days
06/04/2020, 10:54 - / James Ball: I used to earn like £40 a month doing nothing after my grandparents inheritance
06/04/2020, 11:41 - David;: Fucking idiot. She's getting so slammed by everyone here.
06/04/2020, 11:43 - David;: Haggis with a rich cream whiskey sauce yesterday. Coffee this morning.
06/04/2020, 11:43 - David;: Arse is an absolute mess. Pebble dashing the bowl at regular intervals.
06/04/2020, 11:44 - David;: Very glad to be WfH
06/04/2020, 11:45 - David;: Haggis looks exactly the same on the way in and out. There's no change of state.
06/04/2020, 11:46 - / James Ball: I had a lot of daal and cabbage this weekend. Immense gas production
06/04/2020, 11:46 - Sam;: This particular meal
06/04/2020, 11:46 - Sam;: Then coffee to ignite it
06/04/2020, 11:47 - David;: Yeah yeah just tossing a match on the petrol
06/04/2020, 11:47 - David;: It couldn't have had more destructive consequences
06/04/2020, 11:51 - David;: >Rooney's whingeing little article
06/04/2020, 11:52 - David;: Oh it's so hard for premier league footballers. Nobody's being nice to us.
06/04/2020, 11:57 - / James Ball: A reasonable point that they are in 45% tax bracket but also that they take home 55%
06/04/2020, 11:58 - Damian Rumble: Can someone please explain to me how a tiger can get a Coronavirus test but large chunks of the NHS staff cannot?
06/04/2020, 11:58 - David;: 55% of millions per year though
06/04/2020, 11:59 - David;: Oh no he's only going to get 3m rather than the forecast 7m
06/04/2020, 11:59 - David;: My heart's not bleeding
06/04/2020, 12:00 - Rob;: They should surely lose income on account that they are no longer creating their clubs wealth. Same logic as my company has used to justify our pay cuts. Morality shouldn't really come into it
06/04/2020, 12:01 - David;: Yeah exactly. Not playing, hence not generating the TV revenue which in theory justifies their salaries.
06/04/2020, 12:01 - Rob;: I feel sorry for Santi Cazorla. Bacteria are his foot and he came back from it and now he'll be too old by the time football restarts
06/04/2020, 12:01 - / James Ball: Yeah, that's my point
06/04/2020, 12:02 - Rob;: *ate his foot
06/04/2020, 12:02 - Phill: Muh little prince
06/04/2020, 12:02 - / James Ball: Are sounds better
06/04/2020, 12:02 - / James Ball: Genetically modified player
06/04/2020, 12:03 - David;: His feet were bacteria. That picture of his ankle was mental.
06/04/2020, 12:03 - David;: Write that off. Amputate.
06/04/2020, 12:03 - Rob;: I wonder which squads will have just aged terribly
06/04/2020, 12:04 - Rob;: And how they will handle contracts expiring in June
06/04/2020, 12:04 - David;: You'd think City will suffer. Aguero, Silva, Fernandinho all getting on. Not sure they will really come back from this
06/04/2020, 12:04 - Rob;: No every player will have kept up the training well
06/04/2020, 12:05 - David;: Plus the whole champions league ban. Everyone has forgotten about that
06/04/2020, 12:05 - Rob;: Charlie Adam's not coming back from this
06/04/2020, 12:05 - David;: Nah
06/04/2020, 12:05 - David;: But he was never there in the first place
06/04/2020, 12:06 - David;: My most hated liverpool player of all time
06/04/2020, 12:06 - David;: 'that cunt's a cunt' - Gerrard on Charlie Adam, 2011
06/04/2020, 12:07 - Jack G;: Souness?
06/04/2020, 12:07 - David;: Was too young to experience genuine rage about Souness. Plus he did his damage as our manager more than as a player.
06/04/2020, 12:08 - Rob;: Burnley average age is 29
06/04/2020, 12:09 - David;: I think football will be back in mid-late May though
06/04/2020, 12:09 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
06/04/2020, 12:09 - David;: They will do behind closed doors, gov will be eagger to push it through as a national morale thing
06/04/2020, 12:10 - Rob;: Will keep people inside in the afternoon
06/04/2020, 12:10 - Jack G;: Would have to put it on free to air if behind closed doors?
06/04/2020, 12:10 - David;: Why?
06/04/2020, 12:10 - Jack G;: All the people that have season tickets?
06/04/2020, 12:11 - David;: They probably just get partial refunds from the clubs. Season tickets mean fuck all to Sky, BT etc.
06/04/2020, 12:11 - Jack G;: Clubs can be cunts though, might be able to get away without refunds
06/04/2020, 12:12 - David;: They could make some deal where they get a voucher for a free TV stream of the game.
06/04/2020, 12:12 - David;: But think they will refund. They have to otherwise whole fanbase will be furious
06/04/2020, 12:14 - David;: Clubs might also argue that most of the season had been played, and was events outside of their control.
06/04/2020, 12:15 - Paul;: force majeure
06/04/2020, 12:16 - Paul;: will void any liability from a club, would be goodwill if they do refund
06/04/2020, 12:16 - David;: Florian Majeurne
06/04/2020, 12:17 - David;: Force Lejeune
06/04/2020, 12:19 - Rob;: It will fuck so many smaller clubs
06/04/2020, 12:19 - Rob;: The football league dead without crowds
06/04/2020, 12:20 - Paul;: that's where you get real fans who actually support their clubs not your nonsense premier league glory supporters
06/04/2020, 12:20 - Paul;: your prawn sandwich eaters etc
06/04/2020, 12:24 - / James Ball: A good prawn sandwich and a trip to see Whitby Town play at home
06/04/2020, 13:21 - Paul;: some hospitals in the USA are now filing for bankruptcy due to lack of patients
06/04/2020, 13:21 - Paul;: ironic
06/04/2020, 13:21 - Paul;: all the usual treatments they do can no longer take place

06/04/2020, 13:32 - Rob;: Yeah you've done well there
06/04/2020, 13:33 - David;: This is utter nonsense
06/04/2020, 13:34 - David;: Complete shit
06/04/2020, 13:39 - David;: This is bollocks hardly anyone is going to die. Already petering out. 150,000 max globally?
06/04/2020, 13:39 - David;: I predict a big backlash
06/04/2020, 13:44 - Paul;: getting high and listening to the coronavirus though
06/04/2020, 13:44 - Paul;: getting your little melon around that
06/04/2020, 13:44 - Phill: Dave you still haven't fed back on princess Mononoke
06/04/2020, 13:45 - David;: Got too tired and had to abandon half way through. Was looking good need to re-watch sober.
06/04/2020, 13:46 - David;: There was actually some semblance of a plot
06/04/2020, 13:46 - David;: Dude gets bitten by huge boar demon, slowly dying, goes west and meets the spirit people and there are wolves.
06/04/2020, 13:51 - David;: They kept the quirkiness to optimal level where there is still some link back to reality and continuity
06/04/2020, 14:08 - Damian Rumble: Did you meet the spirit of the Forrest? Not sure how your bonce would deal with that guy in a blooted stupor
06/04/2020, 14:53 - Paul;: Britain's largest telecoms company, BT, has pledged not to fire or furlough any of its staff for the next three months.
06/04/2020, 14:54 - Paul;: they're retaining their precious data goose / pangolin
06/04/2020, 15:01 - David;: Do you speak mandarin? No sorry, only pangolin
06/04/2020, 15:12 - Jack G;: Unlike liverpool and spurs who have taken the first opportunity to furlough non player staff and use tax payer money despite having billionaire owners
06/04/2020, 16:04 - / James Ball: A lot of military planes active today from brize norton
06/04/2020, 16:05 - / James Ball: Rushing fresh BJ piss samples for analysis no doubt
06/04/2020, 17:00 - David;: Contract ended! So begins the never ending froust
06/04/2020, 17:01 - Phill: Lol Raab
06/04/2020, 17:01 - Phill: "Welcome to Downing Street"
06/04/2020, 17:01 - Jack G;: Fucking Raab. The biggest idiot
06/04/2020, 17:02 - Phill: Dave, drop £400 on a mid range gaming rig and come play some civilisation/anno/Rome total war.
06/04/2020, 17:03 - David;: Which version of Rome. Still got the original classic.
06/04/2020, 17:03 - David;: Probably going to get very pissed and play a lot of switch. That's the short term outlook
06/04/2020, 17:03 - Phill: Dinner for me tonight - 

Onion, garlic, thyme potato gratin. While camambert melted on top. Red wine.
06/04/2020, 17:04 - Phill: Whole*
06/04/2020, 17:04 - David;: The gas after that
06/04/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: Ah I have everything in to make this
06/04/2020, 17:05 - David;: Is that the dish the French try to pretend isn't absolute grotty filth by calling a raclette
06/04/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: That's Swiss I think
06/04/2020, 17:06 - Rob;: Whole pototoes usually, not a gratin
06/04/2020, 17:07 - David;: I've got big plans to make a tarte flambee
06/04/2020, 17:07 - David;: French pizza - full grot.
06/04/2020, 17:07 - David;: They don't even bother with the tomato just more cream instead with the cheese.
06/04/2020, 17:09 - Phill: HHHNNNNGGGGG
06/04/2020, 17:09 - Jack G;: Could also make this. Have some double cream to use up
06/04/2020, 17:09 - David;: Lol synchronised grot then trace the gas. A natural experiment.

06/04/2020, 17:13 - Phill: Nice to see you back, based Whitty
06/04/2020, 17:14 - Phill: The releif you'd feel if you knew you have had Covid and you could just charge about not giving an fuck.
06/04/2020, 17:15 - David;: Raabs shit
06/04/2020, 17:15 - David;: Don't rate
06/04/2020, 17:17 - Phill: Pops a boner every time he's addressed as Foreign Secretary
06/04/2020, 17:20 - Rob;: 439 deaths today. Two decreases in a row reassuring, but then didn't this happen Sunday/Monday last week only for it to climb massively? Could be getting trolled every week by delayed reporting over the weekend
06/04/2020, 17:20 - / James Ball: nah. peak.
06/04/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: If that was it then we'd actually have done very well
06/04/2020, 17:21 - David;: May as well end the locky
06/04/2020, 17:21 - / James Ball: yep, everyone go out to the park

06/04/2020, 17:22 - Phill: Isn't it to do with recording cause of death over the weekend?
06/04/2020, 17:23 - Jack G;: Peak done. Virus done
06/04/2020, 17:23 - David;: Next
06/04/2020, 17:23 - Jack G;: Time to get the barbecue out
06/04/2020, 17:24 - David;: Would be quite awkward if that's it.
06/04/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: All just paperwork
06/04/2020, 17:25 - Rob;: The admin troll
06/04/2020, 17:41 - Paul;: so covid was just one big troll
06/04/2020, 17:42 - Paul;: should let us out of locky for 2 weeks, then lockdown 2 weeks see how bad the cases get
06/04/2020, 17:42 - Paul;: or do a rolling test release from locky via counties
06/04/2020, 17:43 - Paul;: and see what happens
06/04/2020, 17:44 - Rob;: I think even if it does plateau here we'll have an extension next Monday
06/04/2020, 17:56 - / James Ball: yeah, guaranteed extension incoming. might relax something
06/04/2020, 18:00 - Damian Rumble: Yaaaas. Would game again.
06/04/2020, 18:01 - Damian Rumble: I relapsed and started playing the newer Britannia total waste. It is shit. Turns out Anglo Saxons are just super boring
06/04/2020, 18:01 - / James Ball: If anyone does do any pc gaming, get discord and then everyone can talk to each other
06/04/2020, 18:01 - / James Ball: an audio thread
06/04/2020, 18:02 - Damian Rumble: That would be somewhat intense
06/04/2020, 18:02 - Phill: Discord goat. Already on it.

The UK government has admitted that none of the 17.5m antibody tests it ordered in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic work well enough to be used.

Always try before you buy
06/04/2020, 18:03 - / James Ball: bit of a blunder there, buying the untested tests
06/04/2020, 18:03 - / James Ball: you'd think that would be a big thing
06/04/2020, 18:04 - / James Ball: or did they just do a big ebay listing dispatched from china "100% working brand new in package anti-body test"
06/04/2020, 18:04 - / James Ball: 17,500,000 pcs

06/04/2020, 18:05 - Damian Rumble: Reminds me of the time Gordon Brown bought all the tamiflu, an untested vaccine for swine flu that never got used because it turns swine flu fucking weak
06/04/2020, 18:05 - / James Ball: shit. a year ago
06/04/2020, 18:06 - Rob;: They have qualified this somewhat. The same tests can get more effective once you have more data from more infections. Not wasted money yet
06/04/2020, 18:06 - Phill: <Media omitted>
06/04/2020, 18:06 - Phill: A simpler time. Paul on the whacker plate.

06/04/2020, 18:18 - Phill: James do you have Rust?
06/04/2020, 18:18 - / James Ball: nah do not own. thought it was shit now
06/04/2020, 18:20 - / James Ball: I'd get it now if it wasn't £31
06/04/2020, 18:44 - Phill: What are you playing?
06/04/2020, 18:44 - / James Ball: nothing terribly multiplayer. Factorio. but I've been sorting out my office a bit as well so not had the PC on in a couple of days
06/04/2020, 18:53 - Phill: Have you tried Stellaris?
06/04/2020, 18:55 - Paul;: Same people who do europa universalis ?
06/04/2020, 18:55 - Phill: Yeah
06/04/2020, 18:56 - / James Ball: On my wishlist actually, I keep meaning to get it

06/04/2020, 18:58 - / James Ball: Usually about £5 on sale

06/04/2020, 20:13 - Jack G;: Are we going to get Raab
06/04/2020, 20:13 - David;: Source?
06/04/2020, 20:13 - Phill: Source
06/04/2020, 20:13 - Phill: Can't see it anywhere

06/04/2020, 20:13 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/bbclaurak/status/1247240275791134720?s=19
06/04/2020, 20:14 - Rob;: Raab to deputise
06/04/2020, 20:14 - Jack G;: Be there now Raab
06/04/2020, 20:14 - Sam;: Fuuuck
06/04/2020, 20:16 - Rob;: Death rate of ICU patients with it is 50%
06/04/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: Probably not relevent for a 55 year old with no known underlying problems
06/04/2020, 20:24 - Rob;: No ventilator. Went at about 7pm
06/04/2020, 20:24 - Paul;: No venty?
06/04/2020, 20:24 - Rob;: No
06/04/2020, 20:25 - Phill: Source?
06/04/2020, 20:25 - Paul;: What instead?
06/04/2020, 20:25 - Rob;: Venty are plenty, but no need
06/04/2020, 20:25 - Rob;: Channel 4 news
06/04/2020, 20:26 - Paul;: Why be in icu if no venty?
06/04/2020, 20:27 - Jack G;: Yeah surely you wouldn’t be in ICU unless you needed invasive ventilation
06/04/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: The briefing is that it's still precautionary, so if that's true I guess proximity to everything that's needed
06/04/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: Sure they have more than just ventilators in there
06/04/2020, 20:28 - Phill: Lol they surely just saying it's precautionary to manage the PR
06/04/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: Yeah I would guess so
06/04/2020, 20:29 - Phill: You dont go into intensive care as a precaution
06/04/2020, 20:29 - Rob;: Unless perhaps you're PM?
06/04/2020, 20:29 - Phill: But you either need intensive care or you don't surely
06/04/2020, 20:30 - Phill: Also bad PR to take up an ICU bed if not required?
06/04/2020, 20:30 - Jack G;: But then why announce intensive care at all if that’s the case
06/04/2020, 20:30 - Rob;: 69 year old Michel Barnier has done a real number on our gov
06/04/2020, 20:31 - Rob;: He was fine
06/04/2020, 20:31 - Sam;: Is it officially announced or just BREAKING from Kuenssberg?
06/04/2020, 20:31 - Jack G;: >Raab running the country
06/04/2020, 20:32 - Rob;: Everyone's running it now
06/04/2020, 20:32 - Rob;: Official statement being added to the BBC news page bit by bit
06/04/2020, 20:33 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
06/04/2020, 20:34 - Damian Rumble: Would be the worse thing for Boris to die. History would remember him as the horric figure who saved the waring Tory party. Won a landslide. United the country. Drove through his Brexit deal before having his time being cut tragically short as the poster child for the victims of the pandemic. He doesn't deserve martyrdom.
06/04/2020, 20:34 - Jack G;: Jesus Christ
06/04/2020, 20:34 - / James Ball: the ultimate way out of his brexit mess though
06/04/2020, 20:34 - / James Ball: he's not a fucking martyr damo
06/04/2020, 20:34 - Paul;: Lol Damian
06/04/2020, 20:35 - Rob;: You just want him to fail as a result of his own poor decisions. Not fucking die
06/04/2020, 20:35 - Hamish Sinclair: He will have been moved for high flow oxygen
06/04/2020, 20:36 - Hamish Sinclair: It's a form of high volume oxygen delivery which creates positive pressure within the alveoli to keep them open
06/04/2020, 20:36 - Hamish Sinclair: But the patient breathes for themselves
06/04/2020, 20:36 - / James Ball: so not at death's door but monitored intensely
06/04/2020, 20:37 - Rob;: How bad would you say you have to be to receive that?
06/04/2020, 20:37 - Jack G;: What’s the prognosis for him if that’s the case? Chances of survival?
06/04/2020, 20:37 - Hamish Sinclair: COVID patients deteriorate really quickly so if they are bad enough to need high flow oxygen they really need to be on itu sp that they can be incubated quickly
06/04/2020, 20:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Also the 50% stat is from italy who were incubating 90 year olds
06/04/2020, 20:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Brightons itu survival rate as of last week was 11 in, 8 alive
06/04/2020, 20:38 - Hamish Sinclair: Pretty bad
06/04/2020, 20:41 - Sam;: They’re really hoping the word precautionary helps to play this down. Not work at all.

Turning of the life support was just a precautionary measure..
06/04/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: Precautionary state funeral
06/04/2020, 20:46 - Damian Rumble: This
06/04/2020, 20:50 - David;: He's been taken to a morgue as a precautionary measure.
06/04/2020, 20:51 - Jack G;: This signed death certificate? Don’t worry, just a precaution
06/04/2020, 20:51 - Phill: Next of kin informed as a precaution.
06/04/2020, 21:26 - David;: So raab is running the country now
06/04/2020, 21:26 - David;: This escalated quickly
06/04/2020, 21:51 - Damian Rumble: Odds that Boris doesn't make it through the night? I'm going 20-1
06/04/2020, 21:56 - Rob;: Doesn't feel right with individuals to me
06/04/2020, 22:49 - / James Ball: Doubt he'll die tonight to be honest
06/04/2020, 22:49 - / James Ball: Probably a critical night though

07/04/2020, 09:04 - Paul;: boris not on a venty
07/04/2020, 09:07 - David;: No likey no venty?
07/04/2020, 09:09 - David;: This is all bollocks. Deaths tailing off. Was collective hysteria
07/04/2020, 09:09 - / James Ball: 6 days till death
07/04/2020, 09:11 - David;: Doesn't this imply no one who gets ventilation survives?
07/04/2020, 09:12 - / James Ball: it does although I'm sure there is some crossover
07/04/2020, 09:12 - Rob;: It also implies that those who get sepsis earlier survive
07/04/2020, 09:12 - Paul;: as soon as a ventilator goes anywhere near them death not far away
07/04/2020, 09:12 - Paul;: the ventilators are actually killing people
07/04/2020, 09:12 - / James Ball: good solid causality that
07/04/2020, 09:13 - David;: The sepsis of life
07/04/2020, 09:13 - / James Ball: give everyone sepsis and ban ventilators
07/04/2020, 09:13 - / James Ball: the only sensible cure
07/04/2020, 09:14 - David;: Yes the only logical conclusion
07/04/2020, 09:16 - / James Ball: venty is a 4 day death knell then
07/04/2020, 09:16 - Damian Rumble: @447507485445  - how do you feel about this BBC article? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52183773
07/04/2020, 09:17 - Paul;: @447854020575 i have no feeling about it

07/04/2020, 09:20 - Damian Rumble: Lies. I feel the rage growing within you. It's just a matter of time until you are consumed by it...
07/04/2020, 09:20 - Paul;: didn't even read it
07/04/2020, 09:21 - Sam;: Paul, the famous sex workers right advocate

07/04/2020, 11:15 - David;: Just had idea for a headline. Luke Shaw miskicks a shot horribly but turns into a wonderful cross that sets up the winning goal. 'Shaw's Shank Redemption'

07/04/2020, 12:25 - / James Ball: ah.

07/04/2020, 12:26 - / James Ball: yes, minor link

07/04/2020, 12:53 - Phill: My guts slid out this morning.

07/04/2020, 13:48 - David;: BBC journalist: 'can you outline some the extraordinary personal qualities of Boris that will  help him in facing this challenge'
07/04/2020, 14:08 - Damian Rumble: This
07/04/2020, 14:09 - / James Ball: I particularly think Boris' womanising and general inability to string a cogent sentence together without blathering are his best qualities for beating the virus
07/04/2020, 14:10 - Paul;: damo, you're consumed by rage that he's not dying on your terms
07/04/2020, 14:12 - David;: I obviously hope he doesn't die but our publically funded broadcaster shouldn't act as if he's a tragically fallen hero.
07/04/2020, 14:14 - Rob;: I'm seen 'hurt in the line of duty' wheeled out. Definitely doesn't apply to  catching a disease unless you're in the NHS
07/04/2020, 14:16 - Phill: Disagree. Many professions providing vital services putting themselves at risk.
07/04/2020, 14:17 - David;: No, definitely conjours unwarranted military analogies
07/04/2020, 14:18 - David;: Basically, the interveiws I've seen the BBC wheels in an old dear friend of his from University and they proceed to eulogise about what a 'larger than life' character he is and how its so shocking 'for someone so full of life' to have been taken from us in this way
07/04/2020, 14:19 - David;: Gets to live through a martyrs death, he's done well there
07/04/2020, 14:20 - Damian Rumble: I'm cringing already at the possible mirror/sun/daily fail headlines. "Magnificent Boris single handedly beat's Barnier's virus and inspires the British lion to victory"

07/04/2020, 14:34 - Rob;: It was announced Monday 23. Took effect 24
07/04/2020, 14:35 - Rob;: So I would guess so, yes
07/04/2020, 14:35 - David;: Guess they will extend sometime this week. Got to give people some time to plan.
07/04/2020, 14:35 - Rob;: You would imagine they would announce before Easter, rather than on a bank holiday? Or do holidays just mean nothing now
07/04/2020, 14:36 - Rob;: Can't sully our Lord's big weekend
07/04/2020, 14:37 - David;: when even is easter

07/04/2020, 14:38 - Rob;: Four day weekend to stay in and not work
07/04/2020, 14:41 - Jack G;: They should just redistribute these bank holidays to later in the year and we can all work them. The most pointless time off
07/04/2020, 14:41 - Jack G;: Two in May we might lose too

More than 600 people have died of alcohol poisoning in Iran since the beginning of the coronavirus outbreak, a judicial spokesman has said.

Another 3,000 people were still ill, he said, adding that people had been drinking unsafe alcohol in the mistaken hope it would protect them from the virus.
07/04/2020, 14:47 - David;: Nah it was the summer bank holiday. No one in. Went back had the day off.
07/04/2020, 14:47 - David;: Great little day that

08/04/2020, 17:21 - Phill: >0.001% of the population
08/04/2020, 17:21 - Phill: Less than even
08/04/2020, 17:22 - Rob;: About 0.1 isn't it
08/04/2020, 17:22 - Rob;: One in a thousand
08/04/2020, 17:22 - Phill: No
08/04/2020, 17:22 - Phill: That would be 600,000
08/04/2020, 17:23 - Phill: 60,000/60,000,000 = 0.001
08/04/2020, 17:23 - Phill: Oh yeah

08/04/2020, 17:23 - Phill: Missed the critical step

08/04/2020, 17:25 - Phill: Only 30% out
08/04/2020, 17:25 - Phill: So by that measure we go again at 48,000 deaths total
08/04/2020, 17:26 - Phill: >lel math
08/04/2020, 17:26 - Phill: 42,000
08/04/2020, 17:30 - David;: Still fuck all actually
08/04/2020, 17:37 - Rob;: Not out of line with their 'we'll do well to keep this under 20,000'
08/04/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: You would guess we'd be second or third worst hit in Europe on pure total deaths, as we have the second or third biggest population depending on if you count Russia as European

10/04/2020, 19:09 - Stefan;: Biggest thing we're missing is a bbq for the terrace. Need some charred meat
10/04/2020, 19:09 - Hamish Sinclair: Having a bed in the wrong place is more annoying than not having a bed at all

10/04/2020, 22:43 - Rob;: But it's now a lot better than Skype HIGNFY

14/04/2020, 10:58 - David;: So this is the relevant figure, 6,000 extra deaths.
14/04/2020, 10:59 - David;: In a population of 68m = 0.009%
14/04/2020, 11:03 - David;: Oh wait that is just in that week though, which was 20% of the total so 0.045%.

14/04/2020, 13:53 - Damian Rumble: 22% of all deaths relating to the disease in the week ending 3 April
14/04/2020, 13:55 - Rob;: Daily stats are total shit at the time of release is something that's become increasingly clear. Often only 10-15% of those announced by ten government happened in the previous 24 hours, with the rest all deaths from up to 10 days ago that can now be announced after the paperwork's been done
14/04/2020, 13:55 - Rob;: Huge lag
14/04/2020, 13:55 - Rob;: Lags on tour
14/04/2020, 13:55 - Damian Rumble: So Corona is partially responsible for approximately 1/3 more deaths than would normally have happened
14/04/2020, 13:56 - Damian Rumble: And 99% of those deaths are with people with pre existing conditions anyway
14/04/2020, 14:13 - David;: I guess this is not a problem as long as the lags are roughly consistent over the time series
14/04/2020, 14:14 - David;: Yeah a lot of things flagged as corona the corona was not necessarily the main reason for the death.

14/04/2020, 19:31 - David;: What was the original context of this?
14/04/2020, 19:31 - Rob;: That's just the name of an Earl Sweatshirt album
14/04/2020, 19:32 - Rob;: You originally saw it in a list of albums out that week and laughed. It then went on to make a lot of album of the year lists
14/04/2020, 19:39 - David;: Haha Earl sweatshirt.
14/04/2020, 19:40 - David;: I don't like shit i don't go outside.
14/04/2020, 19:40 - David;: And that was a critics favourite
14/04/2020, 19:40 - David;: Where is he now?
14/04/2020, 19:42 - Rob;: Done another album. I was listening to a song from it earlier and remembered this
14/04/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: Watching Quiz, the Who Wants to Be. Millionaire coughing scandal thing.
14/04/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: Major Charles Ingram occupies a really great space in classic British villains
14/04/2020, 21:39 - Paul;: I was very pissed off when they first aired that back in the day as they turned the sound of the coughing up so you couldn’t tell how it actually sounded at the time
14/04/2020, 21:39 - Rob;: See also, Nasty Nick from S1 Big Brother (crime: had a biro) and Paul Burrell (Crime: sniffed dead Diana's dresses)
14/04/2020, 21:40 - Paul;: He’s a scapegoat. Justice for Ingram
14/04/2020, 21:40 - Rob;: You'll hate the frame version then. Coughing louder than Chris Tarrant
14/04/2020, 21:40 - Rob;: *drama version
14/04/2020, 21:40 - Paul;: Nonsense
14/04/2020, 21:40 - Paul;: It was barely audible in the studio
14/04/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: There’s a much deeper conspiracy
14/04/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: But he's right behind him Paul
14/04/2020, 21:41 - Paul;: Find me the original tapes with original audio
14/04/2020, 21:43 - Sam;: Tarrant didn’t want a winner on his watch so he manipulated the audio to make Ingram a villain
14/04/2020, 21:43 - Sam;: Ingram actually killed hitler
14/04/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: Bigger cover up than saville
14/04/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: Why did they have to dig up the dirt again on poor old Ingram
14/04/2020, 21:45 - Rob;: If you list the first letters to all his answers they spell out CHARLES IS INNOCENT
14/04/2020, 21:46 - Sam;: Saville tried to expose Tarrant but Tarrant killed him then made up the pedo stuff to discredit Saville in death
14/04/2020, 21:49 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
14/04/2020, 21:53 - Sam;: Yes. Ingram was planted to make sure Tarrant killed him. Ingram didn’t know he was to die for the million. Once Tarrant had murdered Ingram, the illuminati then had something on him
14/04/2020, 21:53 - Paul;: It’s all very obvious
14/04/2020, 21:53 - Sam;: Loominarrtea own Tarrant now

16/04/2020, 09:25 - Damian Rumble: Americans protesting the lock down by meeting up in large groups and complaining about having to get by on unemployment and not being able to buy hair dye is the GOAT example of 'first world problems'. Social Darwinism at its finest... 

BBC News - Coronavirus: Trump says peak is passed and US to reopen soon

16/04/2020, 10:34 - Paul;: i just fucking hate the bbc. I'm done with them
16/04/2020, 11:15 - Paul;: More than nine in 10 people dying with coronavirus have an underlying health condition, according to new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

The ONS looked at nearly 4,000 deaths during March in England and Wales where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate.

In 91% of cases the individuals had other health problems.

The most common was heart disease, followed by dementia and respiratory illness.

The average number of pre-existing conditions in those who died was 2.7.
16/04/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: It would be disingenuous to suggest all those underlying conditions would have led to imminent death anyway though
16/04/2020, 11:18 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>

20/04/2020, 17:02 - Jack G;: Not got a PlayStation to play it but watched a bit of it on YouTube. Looks pretty good, they’d added a lot more backstory and given more life to Midgar
20/04/2020, 17:03 - David;: Yeah I've watched a bit of the gameplay. Looks decent I'm still mourning the turn based strategy though
20/04/2020, 17:03 - David;: It was all about setting your team up before the battles
20/04/2020, 17:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah havnt played it. Want to dismiss it as shit out of hand but everything I read suggests theyve added depth
20/04/2020, 17:04 - David;: I've started the original again on switch as a substitute.
20/04/2020, 17:04 - Jack G;: Thing is though if you want the turn based strategy just play the original. Good to make the remake a bit different
20/04/2020, 17:04 - David;: I'll be interested to see how they deal with the world map and highwind given how they've set up the combat system.
20/04/2020, 17:05 - David;: How would the random encounters for levelling up work.
20/04/2020, 17:10 - Jack G;: Yeah will see if they stick with the linear theme for part 2 or go more open world. Either way the story is really good and gameplay top notch

21/04/2020, 15:40 - / James Ball: Heard and interesting article on the radio - new regs are meaning that doctors can issue death certificates without seeing the patient in person. It is likely that a lot of patients are dying without having covid-19 listed on their death certificates because the doctor does not feel confident enough to list it or because no test was done confirming it. It is very likely a lot of people are dying from pneumonia (or other conditions) caused by or exacerbated by covid-19 but covid-19 is not listed on the death certificate for a number of reasons.
21/04/2020, 15:54 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I suspect that 'flu and pneumonia' to be a very large part Corona related
21/04/2020, 16:00 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes we have had 90minutes/day Included in our work schedule to write death certificates for people we have never met
21/04/2020, 16:01 - Paul;: do you just guess based on symptoms?
21/04/2020, 16:01 - Paul;: or get to make it up?
21/04/2020, 16:01 - Rob;: 'Hi, we've not met, but I'd like to inform you that you are dead'
21/04/2020, 16:02 - Paul;: a precautionary death cetificate
21/04/2020, 16:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Based on the medical notes and investigations. Most of the ones we are doing have been admitted to hospital so you have enough information
21/04/2020, 16:03 - Hamish Sinclair: I think the most informative statistic will be the collective pneumonia/flu/covid data
21/04/2020, 16:04 - Hamish Sinclair: As it would be reasonable to assume that the difference between the flu/pneumonia 2019 to 2020 stats are due to covid
21/04/2020, 16:04 - Stefan;: Does this include suspected but not tested covid cases?
21/04/2020, 16:05 - Hamish Sinclair: So someone dying in the community may not have had any investigations which makes it harder. If they died of a respiratory illness but havnt had imaging or a swab then it's likely that they will be put down as "pneumonia" as this is an umbrella term (you can die of bacterial or viral pneumonia so the actual pathogen is unimportant)
21/04/2020, 16:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Best approach would be to take the average flu/pneumonia rates from last 5 years and compare it with 2020 rates of flu/pneumonia/covid
21/04/2020, 16:18 - Stefan;: From what I've seen, the number of excess deaths compared to normal matches quite closely with deaths recorded as covid-related
21/04/2020, 16:25 - Hamish Sinclair: This will likely separate as excess deaths from things like cancer begin to show
21/04/2020, 16:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Woukdnt expect cancer incidence to change yet referrals for cancer treatment down 75%
21/04/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: That's going to be devastating
21/04/2020, 16:26 - Paul;: So everyone will die from preventable cancer instead?

22/04/2020, 18:02 - Sam;: We’re entering the phase were cunts are realising that mindless positivity doesn’t result in lockdown measures being eased.

22/04/2020, 18:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah, awkward
22/04/2020, 18:08 - Hamish Sinclair: It's a by product of this "nhs heros" bollocks
22/04/2020, 18:08 - Rob;: We should just continue 'donating' taxes and the government should help out the NHS. A tin of beans off of everyone isn't helping.

22/04/2020, 22:31 - Paul;: The big punchline jokes about the lack of pediatric units being built
22/04/2020, 22:32 - Rob;: 'and he said to me, the hospital would be built that quickly'
22/04/2020, 22:40 - Rob;: There is a letter sent by a transport union to Network Rail suggesting that the gov is preparing for transport services to be increased by May 18 to some intermediary level. Leaked to Robert Peston

23/04/2020, 12:50 - David;: Also makes me feel like I'm getting to that point of being an old fucker who thinks political correctness has gone mad. No one could get away with a show like that now. So much great shit chatted.

23/04/2020, 18:01 - Paul;: expect to hear "It's an honour" - "most important thing i've ever done" - "highlight of my career" - "The real heroes on the front line" - "caring for one another"

23/04/2020, 18:26 - David;: "it's incredibly how people are coming together" "I asked myself what I could do to help out, it's not much but I hope it brings some joy"
23/04/2020, 18:26 - Paul;: in one, that's all it's going to be
23/04/2020, 18:27 - David;: That would be great. But can we make the cut off 1990 or something. Don't want to trawl through black and white shit that everyone has to pretend are great classics
23/04/2020, 18:28 - Rob;: 1990 very early I reckon. A lot of classics missed
23/04/2020, 18:28 - David;: I can stretch to 1970 at the earliest
23/04/2020, 18:28 - Rob;: I'm fine with that
23/04/2020, 18:29 - David;: Remember after this your only getting 1 film release a month
23/04/2020, 18:29 - Paul;: you always get some art house cunts who bring out their film in black and white and focus on dialogue and artistic filming angles
23/04/2020, 18:29 - Rob;: Missing a lot of Kubrick by losing out on the 60s
23/04/2020, 18:30 - Paul;: 2001 a space Odyssey. shit.
23/04/2020, 18:31 - David;: That's fine there are some great high res modern black and white films. Embrace of the serpent a case in point

23/04/2020, 18:31 - David;: No.
23/04/2020, 18:32 - Paul;: if you can get colour make use of it. i see no merit of making black and white films other than to be pretentious
23/04/2020, 18:32 - Rob;: I like that it saw plot and said no thank you. That insane last half hour. Visuals hold up well. Too long.
23/04/2020, 18:35 - David;: It works because it's set in the amazon rainforest and you get very HD but black and white shots. Also all the colour comes back right at the end when he takes Ayahuasca.
23/04/2020, 18:35 - David;: Scope
23/04/2020, 18:35 - Paul;: could have done it in reverse. enjoy colour then switch to black and white after the ayahuasca

23/04/2020, 18:50 - Damian Rumble: I watched that at the science museum once. Somewhat confused be the middle sequence where some very bland people are just hanging out on the spaceship chatting. Then you never hear from them again
23/04/2020, 18:55 - Rob;: Yeah. It's not linear narrative
23/04/2020, 20:00 - Rob;: Ah the fucking honking

23/04/2020, 21:00 - / James Ball: Giving Captain Tom the sweet release he craves
23/04/2020, 21:20 - Rob;: I basically constantly used to think about the concept of DEVS as a kid.
23/04/2020, 21:21 - Rob;: Only on ep2. Enjoying.
23/04/2020, 21:21 - Paul;: The powerful quantum computer?
23/04/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: The idea that if you could get a simulation accurate enough you could just simulate everything forward and backwards in time, and whether that could ever be possible
23/04/2020, 21:31 - Paul;: Are you sure you weren’t just watching DEVS then made a false memory?
23/04/2020, 21:31 - Rob;: No
23/04/2020, 21:33 - Paul;: Sounds very much like you’ve been watching DEVS
23/04/2020, 21:35 - Rob;: That's just a logical extension of the concept of simulation
23/04/2020, 21:36 - Phill: DEVS is just a DVD player.
23/04/2020, 21:36 - Phill: They’ve invented a DVD player

23/04/2020, 21:36 - Phill: Simulating history that people already know
23/04/2020, 21:36 - Phill: Big wup
23/04/2020, 21:37 - Phill: <Media omitted>
23/04/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: So rob, you’re saying you invented the dvd?
23/04/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: But not the player?
23/04/2020, 21:40 - Rob;: I believe I've made that clear
23/04/2020, 21:47 - Paul;: Does it annoy you you’ve got none of the credit for DEVS
24/04/2020, 08:01 - Rob;: “And then I see the disinfectant where it knocks it out in a minute,” Trump said. “One minute! And is there a way we can do something, by an injection inside or almost a cleaning? Because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that. So, that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me.”
24/04/2020, 08:01 - Phill: The woman’s face is the best
24/04/2020, 08:01 - Rob;: I haven't seen the video
24/04/2020, 08:02 - Rob;: I just love this reaction: Walter Shaub, the former director of the Office of Government Ethics, added: “It is incomprehensible to me that a moron like this holds the highest office in the land and that there exist people stupid enough to think this is OK. I can’t believe that in 2020 I have to caution anyone listening to the president that injecting disinfectant could kill you.”
24/04/2020, 08:03 - Paul;: He’s losing his mind at a more rapid rate
24/04/2020, 08:03 - Paul;: And their alternative is an even older sleepy joe

24/04/2020, 11:43 - Rob;: Displaying so much mistrust of academic doctors. Has to clarify always that he only trusts the medics with this
24/04/2020, 11:43 - David;: Ah the woman's response. Like talking to your dementia riddles granddad and just humouring him
24/04/2020, 11:46 - David;: But his approval rating has never been higher?

24/04/2020, 15:01 - David;: Lol so the tests sold out in 2 minutes
24/04/2020, 15:02 - Damian Rumble: I suspect trump is probably loving the fact the majority of people who are dying are from poor ethnic minority voters who live in cities... I.e. democrat voters
24/04/2020, 15:39 - / James Ball: I genuinely think Trump is actually totally unaware
24/04/2020, 15:39 - / James Ball: The GOP however is and is happily using Trump to whip up republican support
24/04/2020, 15:39 - / James Ball: Trump is genuinely a senile moron

26/04/2020, 22:49 - Damian Rumble: We recently watch series 1 on iPlayer. The team that won that were this 60 year old couple who consistently made terrible decisions and kept banging on about they were tight Yorkshire folk but kept getting lucky with their boarder connections.
26/04/2020, 23:42 - Damian Rumble: On an entirely separate note. Has anyone seen 'the midnight gospel'? It's as if you took two stoned people recording a podcast and overlaid that on top of some trippy as fuck, parallel universe bending, animated short stories that makes Rick and Morty seem like the Simpsons.

Wednesday is at least a mid point, it's acceptable to drink and maybe go out on a Wednesday. Saturday is good but too busy, every other fucker is out on a Saturday. Friday is both a weekend day and an end to the week, double bubble. Sunday is both a weekend, quiet and often with very little to do new week anxiety is a thing though - I'll take that one.

01/05/2020, 11:33 - Paul;: Whitty superior to Vallance but is that because he's slightly odd looking
01/05/2020, 11:34 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
01/05/2020, 11:34 - Paul;: GOAT WHITTY
01/05/2020, 11:35 - Rob;: Yeah Witty is great
01/05/2020, 11:35 - Rob;: Get him on Celebrity Big Brother
01/05/2020, 11:35 - Paul;: Whitty and captain Tom in the great british wank off

01/05/2020, 14:17 - David;: So London has lost a chippy
01/05/2020, 14:17 - David;: Have you been tested yet Hamish?
01/05/2020, 14:53 - Hamish Sinclair: Have I no had a test
01/05/2020, 14:53 - Hamish Sinclair: No symptoms
01/05/2020, 15:47 - David;: The 100k though. Shouldn't they be spaffing them everywhere now
01/05/2020, 15:48 - Stefan;: Lol I'm now considered a key worker so I can get a test too
01/05/2020, 15:50 - Rob;: How many per day would actually be really effective? Like half a million?
01/05/2020, 15:50 - Phill: 100k a day is 2 years to test everyone
01/05/2020, 15:50 - Rob;: 100k a day still taks you 2 years to do everyone
01/05/2020, 15:50 - Rob;: Yeah
01/05/2020, 15:52 - Rob;: You need to do it in like a month during lockdown to properly eradicate it that way
01/05/2020, 16:08 - Stefan;: It depends on how many current cases there are and the transmission rate
01/05/2020, 16:08 - Stefan;: I.e. how many chains of infection need to be monitored at the same time
01/05/2020, 16:09 - Rob;: So, basically useless right now
01/05/2020, 16:09 - Stefan;: Vallance was asked yesterday what the R0 rate needs to be for track and trace to work, but he couldn't put a number on it
01/05/2020, 16:14 - Rob;: I wonder if we might accidentally eradicate some other diseases by reducing their R number to 0
01/05/2020, 16:14 - Rob;: Corona forever, but colds gone
01/05/2020, 16:18 - Rob;: Anal syphilis finally gone
01/05/2020, 16:21 - Stefan;: This is a thing - sexual health clinics are trying to get everyone to test for HIV now that people have stopped shagging around for a few weeks
01/05/2020, 16:26 - Rob;: I know a few very responsible people who have broken and left the house to meet with dating app matches in lockdown
01/05/2020, 16:27 - Rob;: I bet there are quite a few grotty people still shagging
01/05/2020, 16:54 - Damian Rumble: Nah
01/05/2020, 16:57 - Damian Rumble: How did you find this info? Funny if a few weeks off of flirting in bars and the occasional night club hook ups has convinced people to lower their standards to breaking quarentine and going round to the house of someone they have never met before for sex
01/05/2020, 16:59 - Damian Rumble: I was telling a friend of mine it would be fun to be single when all bars and clubs open again. With months of sex starvation... It will be basically descend immediately into an Orgy.
01/05/2020, 17:00 - / James Ball: > syphilis

02/05/2020, 09:17 - Phill: They’re both cooked as fuck
02/05/2020, 09:28 - David;: What I don't really get. The story about why Italy had such high death toll was because it's health system was overwhelmed. We're always being told NHS hasn't been overwhelmed and there is spare capacity. But have the same death toll as Italy now.
02/05/2020, 09:32 - David;: Soo....
02/05/2020, 09:58 - Rob;: Also ours is probably worse since we weren't counting care home deaths until recently and there's a big lag to account for those so more still to come in for the past couple of weeks
02/05/2020, 10:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Italys approach to medicine is to flog dead horses and put everyone on a ventilator, even your 100year old granny. Hence their health system got overwhelmed very quickly
02/05/2020, 10:03 - Hamish Sinclair: We have a much more cautious approach and didnt overwhelm our ventilator capacity
02/05/2020, 10:04 - Hamish Sinclair: And also were proactive in preventing the most vulnerable from coming into hospital
02/05/2020, 10:34 - David;: How did we get a similar death rate/curve through?
02/05/2020, 10:35 - Phill: Lockdown delays probably
02/05/2020, 10:35 - Phill: Haven’t shut down the entire country either
02/05/2020, 10:36 - Phill: Construction sites still open
02/05/2020, 10:36 - Phill: Have 3 people at work with it now that would have been avoided if they shut it down
02/05/2020, 10:36 - Phill: Italy has a stricter locky
02/05/2020, 10:37 - David;: So we've essentially achieved a similar result but with less butt hurt to health workers and the general public
02/05/2020, 10:39 - David;: Our death rate is the same but our butt hurt/death ratio is better
02/05/2020, 10:40 - Phill: I think this is the best hypothesis
02/05/2020, 10:40 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
02/05/2020, 10:41 - Damian Rumble: We have a better death rate per capita
02/05/2020, 10:41 - Phill: Also maybe our healthcare system is more developed with a bigger reserve
02/05/2020, 10:42 - Damian Rumble: I suspect our deaths are primarily because Boris was slow to implement a lock down. It should really have happened at least a week earlier
02/05/2020, 10:44 - Rob;: Yeah, although Italy's locky was later and closer to their peak compared to other European countries, by dint of being the first nation in the region affected badly and having to be the first
02/05/2020, 10:44 - Rob;: It was also partial initially and leaked, so there were huge rushes to escape the north
02/05/2020, 10:44 - Phill: There are also probably multiple strains of Covid now with some more deadly and contagious than others
02/05/2020, 10:45 - Rob;: There are certainly different strains
02/05/2020, 10:46 - Damian Rumble: Yeah this
02/05/2020, 10:48 - Damian Rumble: Apparently holding the Cheltenham festival and having the Spanish fans come over for the champions League in early may has had a sizeable impact here as well
02/05/2020, 10:53 - Rob;: We really fucked teh first three weeks of March
02/05/2020, 10:54 - Rob;: Has meant we've put in all the effort of the lockdown but ended up with the same result as the countries that got hit with no time to prepare
02/05/2020, 10:54 - Rob;: That Sunday Times analysis of the gov in Feb and March from the other week was excellent
02/05/2020, 11:13 - David;: This is mainly because we are less far along and closer to the peak still
02/05/2020, 11:23 - David;: What is the difference between 'track' and 'trace'?
02/05/2020, 11:36 - Rob;: Like aide and abet

05/05/2020, 08:51 - Sam;: Waste of resources and effort
05/05/2020, 08:55 - Rob;: Hard to say, because it's better not to need it
05/05/2020, 08:55 - Rob;: And you would always want a government that takes precautions against the worst case scenario
05/05/2020, 08:56 - Rob;: A criticism I read was that more beds and space were well and good, but if you transferred a patient there you also had to transfer staff, so many hospitals decided against that
05/05/2020, 09:45 - Damian Rumble: It was a good idea it just should have been set up in February to take all the covid patients in London rather than having them dispersed across and disrupting existing hospitals. Useful to know we have up our sleeves for the future
05/05/2020, 09:49 - Damian Rumble: In between the blatant Tory lie that  they are funding it well and the constant "we're on the brink" narrative it looks, it looks like the NHS has organised itself very well across-the-board (I'm sure Hamish will correct me if I'm wrong here)

05/05/2020, 16:14 - Hamish Sinclair: I think this is mostly true. The nightingale hospitals were a good idea and building them so quickly was impressive but fundamentally limited by lack of staff to work in them (see scrapping of student nurseries, alienation of eu workforce and junior doctors conflict). Apparently the criteria to get a patient into them was so specific that most patients didnt qualify. Most hospitals only managed by expanding their in house itu capacity and setting very strict itu admission criteria
05/05/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: It's from when we were in Gloucester Tesco once and a couple of grotty obeasts were picking up pizzas for 'the boy'.

06/05/2020, 08:26 - Rob;: We'll quite comfortably end up with the largest death toll in Europe
06/05/2020, 08:28 - David;: That's the excy?
06/05/2020, 08:29 - David;: Will need to also know how much excess goes down by later if much of it is people being killed off a bit sooner so their deaths being dragged forward
06/05/2020, 08:29 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
06/05/2020, 08:30 - Rob;: Yes
06/05/2020, 08:32 - Rob;: I wonder also if they are calibrating excess deaths to account for the non-corona deaths that lockdown prevents as a side effect - fewer car crashes, flu deaths, drunken genocides - their reduction might actually be making excess corona deaths seem fewer
06/05/2020, 08:33 - David;: I guess excess deaths necessarily factors that in
06/05/2020, 08:34 - David;: It just captures the overall net effect
06/05/2020, 08:34 - Rob;: But what we do know is that we already have the worst death toll in Europe and there's a two week time lag in reporting which will see our total increase faster than other countries because we are closer to our peak
06/05/2020, 08:35 - David;: But we're clapping for the carers Rob
06/05/2020, 08:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Dont talk about the deaths, let's smear an unelected scientist instead
06/05/2020, 08:35 - David;: Major Tom Rob

06/05/2020, 08:35 - Hamish Sinclair: Get Coronavirus done
06/05/2020, 08:36 - Rob;: But it might reduce the number you could assume was corona, if 1k fewer people die of other causes each week than normal ad you're using excess deaths to work out corona deaths, then you miss 1k deaths

06/05/2020, 08:38 - Rob;: It's much less relevent if you're a hypocrite when you're a scientist
06/05/2020, 08:38 - Rob;: (than a politician)
06/05/2020, 08:39 - Hamish Sinclair: Yes, you cant decide it's ok for boris to have multiple affairs (and illegitimate children?) And then use it as a stick to beat a scientist
06/05/2020, 08:40 - Rob;: It's the only reason we know the scientists names now, so the government have people to blame when things go wrong
06/05/2020, 08:40 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah very true

06/05/2020, 08:42 - Rob;: I think they just need to go rogue in the daily briefings now and reveal all the times their advice was ignored. Say 'we would have locked down two weeks earlier. If we had enough testing kit, which we asked for, we would have been able to have a proper plan. If the gov hadn't stripped back pandemic and PPE funding over a decade we would have done better'

06/05/2020, 13:54 - Phill: So a massive overindulgence in the first instance.
06/05/2020, 13:55 - Jack G;: Not really, in fact I think I’ll continue to buy bog roll in 24 packs going forward. More convenient, having to lug a pack home less regularly

06/05/2020, 16:06 - Rob;: A moron at work, genuinely one of the most stupid people I have ever met, has been writing motivational post its for her team mates. Hasn't really thought this one through
06/05/2020, 16:07 - Paul;: Lol more examples of this stupidity?
06/05/2020, 16:08 - Rob;: She's been resitting GCSE foundation maths to prove that she can do it. But has failed 3 times
06/05/2020, 16:08 - Rob;: Going for 4th time lucky after lockdown
06/05/2020, 16:12 - Sam;: Jesus. Why is she revealing any of that. Let it go. You got this without foundation maths
06/05/2020, 16:12 - Paul;: How old is she?
06/05/2020, 16:12 - Rob;: She's been quite candid about it
06/05/2020, 16:12 - Rob;: 50
06/05/2020, 16:13 - Rob;: She talked to me a lot about it because she wanted me to help her with the questions
06/05/2020, 16:13 - Rob;: But she would leave as soon as she got the answer and not try to understand the logic so she could solve a similar problem next time
06/05/2020, 16:14 - Rob;: She's a relatively junior designer at work. Everyone else in her team 15-25 years younger and mostly more senior
06/05/2020, 16:16 - Paul;: There was a women at work we had who couldn’t understand anything. Nor did she ever possess the words to explain what she meant so confused everything. Actually moronic

06/05/2020, 21:43 - David;: Gets bigger and bigger and they're having to just deal with that around the house
06/05/2020, 21:43 - Paul;: You always charge a guy with a cat, with a chimp you always run away
06/05/2020, 21:43 - David;: Violently unpredictable
06/05/2020, 21:44 - David;: You charge a gun from a knife you run
06/05/2020, 21:44 - David;: I couldn't live with a chimp
06/05/2020, 21:44 - David;: It's unviable
06/05/2020, 21:44 - Paul;: I’ve read up on the attack stories of chimps
06/05/2020, 21:45 - Paul;: And they always destroy people
06/05/2020, 21:45 - Paul;: You can brush of stroking a cat the wrong way but a chimp...

06/05/2020, 21:47 - Paul;: Not a thing
06/05/2020, 21:47 - David;: Joe exotic was saying apes are the one animal he never goes near.
06/05/2020, 21:48 - Paul;: And he’s mental but even knows that
06/05/2020, 21:48 - David;: They trick you in and then attack when you least expect.
06/05/2020, 21:48 - David;: Yeah he's go in with big cats, tigers etc. but never an ape or chimp. He draws the line there.
06/05/2020, 21:49 - David;: So this woman took on a baby chimp as her child and it's gradually getting bigger and more unmanageable

07/05/2020, 11:42 - Damian Rumble: Just had this passed to me... I'm not sure how reliable it is but it will likely change quite a bit over time anyway
07/05/2020, 11:43 - Rob;: 18 May was the date on that leaked letter from a transport union Robert Peston shared a week or two ago
07/05/2020, 11:46 - Rob;: I would be surprised if they release that much detail in one go
07/05/2020, 12:46 - Stefan;: Some of the rules on social gatherings - how is  govt going to communicate those and ensure people actually understand and can follow them
07/05/2020, 12:46 - Stefan;: They're fairly complex and will be changing every 3 weeks, which is a massive public comms challenge
07/05/2020, 12:48 - Rob;: If that's real, it might just be the internal plan, with only one phase to be communicated by the government at once
07/05/2020, 13:00 - David;: Yeah would be chaos. And unenforceable - people would start meeting normally again.
07/05/2020, 13:00 - David;: If this was true earliest prem could start again is June 29th. Wonder if that's early enough for them to still complete season.
07/05/2020, 13:02 - David;: That means it could be done mid August. A month off-season (given they've already had a rest), start in mid/late September and compress season by e.g cancelling some domestic cups maybe?
07/05/2020, 13:03 - David;: I say just get rid of FA and League cups next season to play through league fixtures more quickly. Try and keep Europe.
07/05/2020, 13:03 - David;: Cancel nation's league as well maybe
07/05/2020, 13:05 - Paul;: @447746875764 how do you feel about all this?
07/05/2020, 13:13 - Jack G;: Only problem is a lack of preseason after such a long break. Injuries all over the place
07/05/2020, 13:14 - David;: Same for everyone Jack
07/05/2020, 13:14 - David;: Luck of the draw

07/05/2020, 20:16 - David;: Sick of it
07/05/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: The people most into it definitely seem to be the people who wouldn't be overly concerned whether the NHS is being supported in the meaningful ways
07/05/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: You can't clap a ventilator into existence
07/05/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Damo I think you recommend the Midnight Gospel on Netflix

08/05/2020, 21:23 - David;: In a bit no one would read.
08/05/2020, 21:23 - Sam;: For the fans
08/05/2020, 21:24 - David;: Yeah it will become collectible. The famous edition with the doefinwah typo
08/05/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: Feasible
08/05/2020, 21:24 - David;: We need this

08/05/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: Could slip it in on my last issue

09/05/2020, 09:52 - / James Ball: Pretty but the ordering hurts me
09/05/2020, 09:56 - / James Ball: Surprising seeing the early peaks and subsequent levelling off in London boroughs at the bottom
09/05/2020, 09:57 - / James Ball: Kent and Hertfordshire the most infected areas. Also very white and old
09/05/2020, 09:59 - Rob;: Looks like countries get wider peaks, perhaps due to slower infection rate?
09/05/2020, 09:59 - Rob;: London boroughs seen to have short sharp peaks
09/05/2020, 10:00 - Rob;: It has all been normalised, so the peak looks just as red for everywhere even if they didn't have many cases, so that total cases column on the right is quite important
09/05/2020, 10:20 - / James Ball: But as it's normalised and the total bar on the left indicates the counties seem to have had slower, more sustained infection building to a higher total. Slower to transmit but more vulnerable people? London's population mostly younger?
09/05/2020, 10:56 - Damian Rumble: It would be good if they had coloured the local authority by region as well but still a cool visualisation non the less
09/05/2020, 10:57 - / James Ball: Yeah, pretty but otherwise difficult to get data from
09/05/2020, 10:59 - Damian Rumble: Home counties really taking the brunt on the impact. Likely the commuters being sent home there
09/05/2020, 11:00 - / James Ball: Yes but also the most populated areas outside London

09/05/2020, 22:37 - / James Ball: 90s britpop questions were there?
09/05/2020, 22:38 - Sam;: Questions mostly feel between 90 and 2005. Perfik
09/05/2020, 22:41 - / James Ball: I feel your victory. I had some tedious and intense game of scrabble at Harriet's then upset her family by using all my letters and winning the game with "HUNT"
09/05/2020, 22:42 - Sam;: A real hunt
09/05/2020, 22:46 - Phill: We are also having a pub quiz. 3 teams of two. 20 for each team. Total of 40 points available. Made mine so hard that they had no realistic chance of getting many right. Won easily.
09/05/2020, 22:46 - Sam;: Lol
10/05/2020, 15:06 - Damian Rumble: >stay alert
10/05/2020, 15:06 - Damian Rumble: What a load of bollocks that advice is
10/05/2020, 15:06 - Damian Rumble: Definitely going to help control the pandemic be being 'alert'
10/05/2020, 15:08 - Damian Rumble: Saw a minister defending the advice as "stay alert means stay at home".... Probably should have kept "stay at home" then you prick.... Just like Scotland, Wales and northern Ireland did.
10/05/2020, 15:09 - Paul;: You butthurt damo
10/05/2020, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: "I'm sorry officer. I might be sunbathing in this park with all my friends and several bottles of wine, but I'm alert... "
10/05/2020, 15:12 - Damian Rumble: How did we end up with such a bunch of amateurs running the country
10/05/2020, 15:33 - Phill: You don’t follow the advice anyway so it doesn’t really matter
10/05/2020, 15:35 - Jack G;: People are starting to break the advice anyway. Better to tell them to be sensible rather than force them to continue lockdown and end up taking it out on people by sneezing in the supermarket queue
10/05/2020, 15:36 - Rob;: It's poor communication. A slogan that is not short-hand for what they say it means
10/05/2020, 15:39 - Rob;: It feels like they've got as bored of the lockdown as everyone else and decided vagueness will give them wiggle room to get some economic activity going while denying responsibility for a surge in infections
10/05/2020, 15:41 - Jack G;: That’s why they keep saying they’re following scientific advice, so they can blame the experts. Doesn’t matter to them that the pandemic focus group is headed by Cummings and the scientist advice isn’t actually taken, the plebs don’t know that
10/05/2020, 16:14 - Damian Rumble: It's politics as well. Restless Tory back benchers can feel like we've done something to ease the lock down whilst the rules haven't really changed at all... All whilst confusing the public and make it harder to enforce
10/05/2020, 16:59 - / James Ball: Keep calm and eat doefinwah Damo
10/05/2020, 17:57 - David;: Slogan is meaningless

10/05/2020, 18:00 - David;: R above 1. This is after lifting just a bit and in Germany where there is a competent government. Going to be fun
10/05/2020, 18:31 - Paul;: Lockdown forever incoming
10/05/2020, 18:39 - Phill: <Media omitted>
10/05/2020, 18:47 - / James Ball: Definitely into June then. The one good thing about coming out of lockdown later is that we can see what all the other countries do first.
10/05/2020, 18:47 - / James Ball: What news of Sweden and Belarus?
10/05/2020, 19:05 - Paul;: Damo you mad you fell into their communications trap they set up for this exact situation? Purposely create a more confusing message so it gets spread more and people hear about it and seek information. Stay sleeping sheeple
10/05/2020, 19:06 - Paul;: They made this for sperg lords like you who would otherwise do as they want thinking they’re above lockdown
10/05/2020, 19:10 - / James Ball: > sperg lord

10/05/2020, 20:01 - Rob;: Like a 2m grid system with ledges for your pint.

10/05/2020, 20:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Just do lines of those pub benches but your only allowed 2 on s bench
10/05/2020, 20:07 - David;: It's going to be so annoying to get in anywhere it won't be worth it
10/05/2020, 20:07 - David;: I mean I'm currently queuing 25 mins to get into home base
10/05/2020, 20:07 - Paul;: Pubs are old news. Need a new invention
10/05/2020, 20:09 - David;: Frousting?
10/05/2020, 20:09 - David;: We've been pioneering a post-corona social model for a decade
10/05/2020, 20:11 - David;: I'm curious as to whether this can genuinely bring back the mullet. Something no one thought would ever be possible
10/05/2020, 20:11 - / James Ball: I went to a pub near me on Friday that was doing exactly that
10/05/2020, 20:12 - Paul;: Yeah the froust concept
10/05/2020, 20:18 - Rob;: Perhaps in the future they will perfect virtual reality calls so it feels like you are actually meeting, and it will seem insane that we hated staying in
10/05/2020, 20:20 - / James Ball: So I can't work from home. Does that mean I should go to my place of work? Despite them all being closed?
10/05/2020, 21:19 - David;: That would seem rather futile
10/05/2020, 21:19 - David;: Just stay alert James
10/05/2020, 21:28 - / James Ball: Alert and destitute

10/05/2020, 22:35 - David;: Therouxs got a new lock down poddy
11/05/2020, 11:18 - David;: So we can meet up outside now
11/05/2020, 11:18 - David;: If 2m apart
11/05/2020, 11:20 - Rob;: Have heard conflicting info from different MPs on whether that's with one or two people
11/05/2020, 11:22 - / James Ball: Infinite people so long as 2m equidistance is maintained
11/05/2020, 11:27 - Rob;: Everyone in the world can have 66m squared each if we spread out evenly
11/05/2020, 11:28 - Rob;: Given some people would have to be on Everest etc, but would elimate Corona with we stayed stood in place for 3 weeks
11/05/2020, 11:29 - Rob;: Actually that includes the sea, so bad luck to 2/3s of people who have to stand in the sea
11/05/2020, 11:35 - Damian Rumble: And Antarctica as well?
11/05/2020, 11:36 - Rob;: Yeah it's just Wikipedia's rough guess of population/world surface
11/05/2020, 11:38 - David;: It's very confusing - e.g. I thought construction workers etc. already could go to work but they are acting as if that is a big change
11/05/2020, 11:41 - / James Ball: people have definitely already been seeing others at a safe distance
11/05/2020, 11:47 - Phill: This is correct. Nothing has changed.
11/05/2020, 11:48 - David;: Yeah, it's basically only the unlimited excercise plus meeting people from other households outside that's changed.
11/05/2020, 11:48 - Rob;: And you can sunbathe now
11/05/2020, 11:49 - Rob;: And fines for breaking the rules, which are less clear now, are more. Double jeopardy.
11/05/2020, 11:55 - David;: Lol Raab saying 'you can meet your mum in the morning and your dad in the afternoon'
11/05/2020, 11:55 - David;: What's fucking difference would it make meeting them both at the same time
11/05/2020, 11:56 - David;: They will transmit to each other anyway in the same household. I think it should be you can meet another household unit rather than one person
11/05/2020, 11:57 - Damian Rumble: But David. They changed the colour from red to green. Surely this means we are back to normal now?
11/05/2020, 11:57 - Damian Rumble: Nudge nudge

11/05/2020, 15:18 - Rob;: Can already observe how the messages are being taken differently withing my own friendship groups - some friends immediately messaging to say shall we meet in a park, others deciding to adhere to the old rules more strictly
11/05/2020, 16:05 - David;: Lol whose taken away stricter adherence from this?
11/05/2020, 16:22 - Rob;: As in, fuck you government, I don't agree it's time to lift it

12/05/2020, 08:57 - Paul;: who's vettle?
12/05/2020, 08:58 - Paul;: is he their star mechanic?
12/05/2020, 09:10 - Damian Rumble: Do you think he will be replaced by Hamilton?
12/05/2020, 09:12 - Jack G;: Doubtful, not when they’ve just given leclerc a bumper contract. Hamilton wouldn’t want to swap Mercedes for the clown show that is the Ferraro strategy team
12/05/2020, 10:45 - Damian Rumble: Would love to Ricardo go to Ferrari. Carlos Saniz jnr. Deserves a shot as well
12/05/2020, 10:46 - Damian Rumble: Not sure really where vettle goes now. There's no space at the mercs or the bulls so he basically has to accept any chance of winning a race again is over
12/05/2020, 10:47 - Rob;: Feel empathy with Stefan during football chat

12/05/2020, 13:10 - Paul;: nice and easy suggestion damo
12/05/2020, 13:10 - Sam;: Has any seen anywhere, whether an employer can reverse a redundancy and furlough some instead under Job Retention Scheme?
12/05/2020, 13:10 - / James Ball: How many years do I need to have worked in a box factory?
12/05/2020, 13:10 - Sam;: Can’t find anything but sure I heard it’s an option
12/05/2020, 13:11 - / James Ball: Yes
12/05/2020, 13:11 - / James Ball: Sunak originally said this was possible.
12/05/2020, 13:11 - / James Ball: But you would expect companies to have done it by now
12/05/2020, 13:13 - Paul;: I think it was at the beginning if you were switching jobs or something similar your original company would adopt you for furlough
12/05/2020, 13:13 - Sam;: Thought so, need to find the gov.uk  page on it or something. I think I’m gonna try going back to the walker boss who just went for redundancy, cap in hand
12/05/2020, 13:13 - Paul;: and they would sort it out
12/05/2020, 13:13 - Sam;: Nah new starters are still caught in a loop hole
12/05/2020, 13:14 - Paul;: why did you not get a furlough?
12/05/2020, 13:14 - Paul;: just a redundo
12/05/2020, 13:14 - / James Ball: Hopefully they extend the self employed measures too. I am only supported up til June currently
12/05/2020, 13:14 - Sam;: Utter pricks. They did it the day before the furlough scheme was announced
12/05/2020, 13:15 - Sam;: Sunak has extended to July then another extension to October but the 80% number share will reduce. Maybe 50 50
12/05/2020, 13:33 - David;: Just heard an epidemiologist on radio 4 saying locky has made no difference
12/05/2020, 13:33 - David;: R and case rate curve would have been about the same regardless
12/05/2020, 13:34 - Hamish Sinclair: I'm sure I heard about someone in this situation taking a unfair dismissal case to their employer
12/05/2020, 13:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Stefan probably would know
12/05/2020, 13:37 - David;: During my career, I was a team mate of Raul Meireles, Martin Skrtel, Brad Jones, Dirk Kuyt and Yossi Benayoun but I have never played for Liverpool. Who am I?
12/05/2020, 13:40 - Rob;: Are Chelsea and Fenerbace clubs that link them?
12/05/2020, 13:41 - David;: Couldn't tell you that Rob.
12/05/2020, 13:41 - Rob;: Or Feyeoord actually. That gets you Brad jones
12/05/2020, 13:43 - Rob;: Soloman Kalou?
12/05/2020, 13:43 - Paul;: @447969894197 has your bruised banana arrived yet?
12/05/2020, 13:44 - David;: Nope
12/05/2020, 13:45 - Rob;: DJ Khalid Boulahrouz?
12/05/2020, 13:45 - Rob;: Yes
12/05/2020, 13:47 - Paul;: How is the banana?
12/05/2020, 13:47 - David;: <Media omitted>
12/05/2020, 13:48 - Rob;: Yeah its good. A good fit. Not the best breather for exercise, but when down the pub exists again as a thing, I can really see myself in it there
12/05/2020, 13:53 - Stefan;: They can re-employ you under the furlough scheme if you were made redundant on or after 28 Feb. If they decided to make you redundant despite knowing that this scheme was coming and that you'd be eligible for it, that could be grounds for unfair dismissal (if you had over 2 years service)
12/05/2020, 13:56 - Sam;: Made redundant after 28 Feb but had under 2 years service. So they could furlough me now still
12/05/2020, 13:56 - Sam;: But no unfair dismissal case
12/05/2020, 14:01 - Rob;: What was their logic here?
12/05/2020, 14:08 - David;: Curves have evolved in the same way across countries, regardless of different lock down policies. We're breathing on each other and on surfaces on shops anyway.
12/05/2020, 14:08 - David;: Rob you of all people should know this player
12/05/2020, 14:08 - David;: <Media omitted>
12/05/2020, 14:09 - David;: (the last one, not this one)
12/05/2020, 14:09 - David;: Who played with all of those?
12/05/2020, 14:10 - Rob;: RvP?
12/05/2020, 14:11 - David;: yep
12/05/2020, 14:11 - David;: I guess skrtel was at fenerbace?
12/05/2020, 14:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Lassana diarra?
12/05/2020, 14:12 - Rob;: I bet data scientists would have it out over this one.
12/05/2020, 14:12 - David;: Good guess. Incorrect.
12/05/2020, 14:12 - Rob;: Of the epidemiologist kind. Not insurance wankers, Damo
12/05/2020, 14:15 - Stefan;: Yeah it's a bit of an anomaly that you could sue them for unfairly making you redundant (if over 2 years service), but not for unfairly refusing to rehire you
12/05/2020, 14:15 - Paul;: @447875303402 did you leave on good terms or incredibly frosty terms?
12/05/2020, 14:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Must be a Monaco link
12/05/2020, 14:18 - David;: This message was deleted
12/05/2020, 14:19 - Damian Rumble: I am not sure I agree with that premise. You can see countries where a strick lock down has been enforced (Italy, France, China, Spain) are starting to see a real drop in infection whereas countries where they largely didn't give a fuck (USA, Russia, Brazil) still seeing rapid increases in cases after months of not really testing properly
12/05/2020, 14:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Similar Berbatov?
12/05/2020, 14:19 - Hamish Sinclair: Dimitar
12/05/2020, 14:20 - Sam;: Stoney faced as it was out of the blue, but not in bad terms

12/05/2020, 14:21 - Sam;: No discussion
12/05/2020, 14:21 - Rob;: I've been down so many football career warrens for this. Gabriel Heinze ended his career at Newell's Old Boys
12/05/2020, 14:21 - David;: Correct
12/05/2020, 14:21 - David;: Yeah I was trolled by thinking it must be a madrid player, but he gets there through Spurs, United and Monaco
12/05/2020, 14:22 - Rob;: Sounds like you recorded it off that radio in ByC
12/05/2020, 14:22 - Rob;: Yeah I couldn't look beyond Madrid
12/05/2020, 14:22 - David;: Lol that was me playing off my phone recording into my laptop
12/05/2020, 14:22 - Paul;: recorded on an edison wax cylinder
12/05/2020, 14:22 - Damian Rumble: Yeah no clue what these guys are saying
12/05/2020, 14:23 - Paul;: worst use of technology yet
12/05/2020, 14:38 - Rob;: What do you think the anti-vaxers have to say about this?
12/05/2020, 14:41 - Rob;: Would they prefer to be under the boot of the disease forever?
12/05/2020, 14:58 - / James Ball: Disease isn't an issue to anti-vaxers non issue
12/05/2020, 14:59 - Rob;: I love that part of their ideaology is rejecting government control though, but in this circumstance vaccination would reduce it
12/05/2020, 15:03 - Phill: This gave me a seizure.
12/05/2020, 15:03 - David;: I think they would easily live with the cognitive dissonance via a nihilistic social darwinism. Just let it rip without the vaccine, develop herd immunity.
12/05/2020, 15:03 - David;: And most of them probably aren't in high risk categories
12/05/2020, 15:18 - Damian Rumble: But Rob. There are micro chips in those vaccines that will turn them all into socialists!
12/05/2020, 15:57 - / James Ball: The signal to noise ratio is extremely poor
13/05/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: Claim submitted, my government bunce is en route
13/05/2020, 17:28 - Paul;: this is exaclty like the free £1k i previously talked about
13/05/2020, 17:28 - Paul;: you are our test subject
13/05/2020, 17:37 - Sam;: Lol no it isn’t
13/05/2020, 17:37 - Sam;: Furlough for the self employed
13/05/2020, 17:38 - Paul;: nah, free 1k
13/05/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: direct
13/05/2020, 18:17 - / James Ball: > Free
> I still have to pay tax on it
13/05/2020, 18:52 - Rob;: Everyone who can't work should be sent an exercise bike that can be plugged into the grid. You have to pedal from 9-5 to generate power for those who can work
13/05/2020, 18:52 - Rob;: I see no problems
13/05/2020, 19:08 - / James Ball: So long as they fuel me and I get paid. I'd be up for it maybe 1 day a week

14/05/2020, 18:15 - / James Ball: Surely that just involves holding a bowl up to his arse?
14/05/2020, 18:18 - Phill: Roast a load of butternut squash.

- roast butternut squash gnocchi with crispy sage butter 
- roast butternut squash soup
- roast butternut squash with green lentil and roast red onion salad with roast chicken. 

3 meals. One squash.
14/05/2020, 18:26 - / James Ball: That's a good shout. Just getting into week 8 of pre-planned meals and lacking inspiration now.
14/05/2020, 18:41 - David;: Chicken Kung pow. Marinade chicken breast overnight in sesame oil, dark soy sauce, chilli flakes, garlic, pepper, honey. toast some cashew nuts in a wok and take out. Turn up heat high and fry the chicken with all the marinade. Add 10-15 chopped spring onions, then 1 or 2 sweet peppers, then the toasted cashews. Fry until the liquid has evaporated and turned sticky. Serve with rice.
14/05/2020, 18:44 - David;: Also do quite a good salmon fried rice, frying the salmon fillets with chilli's, garlic and chopped ginger. Then add spring onions, pat choi and peppers. Then fry in rice and stir in horseradish cream, siracha and bit of soy sauce
14/05/2020, 18:45 - David;: Very quick
14/05/2020, 19:28 - Phill: Ah. My 97 year old grandmother has tested positive in her care home. No symptoms.

15/05/2020, 23:24 - David;: Pippen = Firmino
15/05/2020, 23:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Love Rodman, given 48 hours to ho to Vegas midseason, takes 80
15/05/2020, 23:32 - David;: Haven't seen that bit yet
15/05/2020, 23:32 - Hamish Sinclair: Has a mad one
16/05/2020, 01:02 - Sam;: Rodman is a personal friend of Kim jong un
16/05/2020, 09:00 - Phill: Can’t watch it. Buzz too big now
16/05/2020, 09:02 - Rob;: Yeah thanks for making it objectively worse with subjective praise. Next.
16/05/2020, 10:42 - David;: You've misunderstood the concept of buzz
16/05/2020, 10:44 - Paul;: The last dance is getting big buzz everywhere. Definition of too much buzz
16/05/2020, 10:45 - David;: Again never even heard of it before I watched it. Your problem may be too much buzz exposure.
16/05/2020, 10:45 - David;: You search out buzz
16/05/2020, 10:46 - Paul;: Lol buzz exposure
16/05/2020, 10:49 - Phill: <Media omitted>
16/05/2020, 10:49 - Phill: No buzz he says
16/05/2020, 10:49 - Phill: Not heard of it he says
16/05/2020, 10:52 - David;: Nah buzz generally has to be word of mouth. Not just reviews.
16/05/2020, 10:54 - Paul;: You created buzz talking of it then said that was not buzz but now it is buzz?
16/05/2020, 10:54 - Paul;: You’re the king of buzz
16/05/2020, 11:11 - Rob;: Dave you're the most non word of mouth person I've ever met
16/05/2020, 11:11 - Rob;: Word of Killing Eve got to you a year after it came out
16/05/2020, 11:11 - David;: Yeah exactly that's buzz
16/05/2020, 11:11 - Rob;: Famously hadn't been aware of Chris Nolan's batman films
16/05/2020, 11:12 - Paul;: Hadn’t heard of roul moat
16/05/2020, 11:12 - Phill: Dave, you heard of Covid-19 yet?
16/05/2020, 11:12 - Rob;: You seem to basically live in a buzz bunker, shielded from buzz but also incredibly susceptible to it if it does get to you
16/05/2020, 11:12 - Rob;: Having just listened to an anecdote about Roaul Moat
16/05/2020, 11:13 - David;: Captain Tom is buzz
16/05/2020, 11:13 - David;: Forced not to engage with any of that
16/05/2020, 11:15 - Phill: Captain Tom’s Butthole Buzz Bukkake Party 2020 hosted by Lenny Henry and Steve Redgrave
16/05/2020, 11:16 - Paul;: Dave have you watched the films yet?
16/05/2020, 11:17 - David;: Nope
16/05/2020, 11:18 - David;: Can't now
16/05/2020, 11:18 - David;: Well I think dark knight was on at yours once actually. That was the origin of blinders and clangers
16/05/2020, 11:19 - David;: And scope
16/05/2020, 11:50 - Paul;: The blinders and clangers?
16/05/2020, 11:51 - David;: Yeah he was constantly pulling blinders and dropping clangers
16/05/2020, 11:52 - David;: Don't watch little comic book films anyway
16/05/2020, 11:53 - David;: The whole marvel thing too much buzz around that shit. Not interested.
16/05/2020, 11:59 - Paul;: He only ever does blinders
16/05/2020, 11:59 - Paul;: Not a single clanger
16/05/2020, 12:03 - Paul;: No clang. All bang
16/05/2020, 12:03 - Rob;: That Batman trilogy is the only decent comic book thing
16/05/2020, 12:04 - David;: People mad for it. All total shit.
16/05/2020, 12:11 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/05/2020, 12:20 - / James Ball: as an anti-buzz demonstration. I'm currently watching Chernobyl
16/05/2020, 12:20 - / James Ball: a year after release
16/05/2020, 12:20 - / James Ball: anti-buxx
16/05/2020, 12:20 - / James Ball: buzz
16/05/2020, 12:21 - / James Ball: no one's talking about Chernobyl now. Buzz gone. programme enjoyed sans buzz
16/05/2020, 12:21 - / James Ball: ✔️ correct
16/05/2020, 12:24 - Rob;: Dave so throughout all the hours of Sam being Bane, you've had no idea what's been going on?
16/05/2020, 12:29 - / James Ball: I really hate all the comic book shit. Makes me shiver. But Dark Knight is a really good action film in its own right
16/05/2020, 12:44 - David;: Dark knight is acceptable. None of the others.
16/05/2020, 13:28 - Rob;: Six Bundesliga matches to chose from this afternoon
16/05/2020, 14:31 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
16/05/2020, 14:31 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
16/05/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: She looks very typically Fiat 500
16/05/2020, 15:28 - Phill: <Media omitted>
16/05/2020, 15:34 - / James Ball: Really loud buzzing
16/05/2020, 15:34 - / James Ball: Different tonal quality from clapping
16/05/2020, 15:35 - David;: Strange I don't hear it in my new street where no one claps
16/05/2020, 15:35 - / James Ball: Would hear it through the clapping easily, especially if it was so loud it permeated the air for hundreds of metres in all directions. The sort of sound pressures required would probably be lethal near the towers
16/05/2020, 15:35 - / James Ball: Clearly no 5G in Edinburgh then
16/05/2020, 15:35 - David;: You'd think that would have revealed the buzzing
16/05/2020, 15:38 - Phill: Lol football without fans is utter shite
16/05/2020, 15:42 - David;: Yeah boring
16/05/2020, 15:43 - Phill: It’s like watching training
16/05/2020, 15:43 - Phill: The spergs at melwood who lurk outside for salahs signature
16/05/2020, 15:44 - David;: I wonder if some players who are great in training but can't deal with the match day pressure will suddenly shine
16/05/2020, 15:44 - David;: Everyone will be tricked into thinking they are greay
16/05/2020, 15:44 - David;: Go for huge transfer fees. Then fans return and they floo
16/05/2020, 15:45 - David;: *flop
16/05/2020, 15:45 - Rob;: But your Scott Browns, your Cattermoles, your Bartons. They're suddenly unable to play due to not being able to wind anyone up
16/05/2020, 15:45 - David;: It will make diving suddenly look ridiculously embarassing and stupid
16/05/2020, 15:45 - David;: A silver lining
16/05/2020, 15:49 - Rob;: You can actually hear the 5G without fans in the stadium
16/05/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: The echoes of the players and staff give it a real indoor kickabout at Morton Fire College vibe
16/05/2020, 15:54 - David;: Yeah. Very Sunday league.
16/05/2020, 15:54 - David;: Would back myself to be playing fine in that environment
16/05/2020, 16:00 - David;: Every chance seems like nothing. Even huge open goal chances
16/05/2020, 16:01 - David;: Someone just hit the post. Past off with no comment or noise
16/05/2020, 16:01 - David;: *passed
16/05/2020, 16:01 - / James Ball: Probably quite relaxing
16/05/2020, 16:01 - / James Ball: A nice relaxing game of football
16/05/2020, 16:01 - David;: But the stakes James. So low. Floor steak.
16/05/2020, 16:02 - Rob;: They should send out a few thousand little headsets so fans can all hear eachother while watching, then aggregate that so it's just crowd noise
16/05/2020, 16:03 - David;: Lol that would be shit. People in their living rooms wouldn't aggregate to the same thing
16/05/2020, 16:03 - Rob;: Then at half time you get thousands of kettles boiling
16/05/2020, 16:03 - David;: Heavy muttering
16/05/2020, 16:03 - Rob;: Nah but they're all feeding off each other
16/05/2020, 16:03 - Rob;: Huge energy
16/05/2020, 16:03 - / James Ball: Would be awful. Very low bitrate
16/05/2020, 16:03 - / James Ball: Lots of lag
16/05/2020, 16:03 - Rob;: They're all chanting
16/05/2020, 16:03 - David;: Could any stream even deal with that as well
16/05/2020, 16:04 - David;: Nah
16/05/2020, 16:04 - Rob;: So you're all arguing for delay these days?
16/05/2020, 16:04 - David;: Could you get a chance going virtually? Would be an achievement
16/05/2020, 16:04 - David;: Well it's already 30 mins delayed so what's a bit more
16/05/2020, 16:04 - Rob;: Yeah yeah huge chants
16/05/2020, 16:04 - / James Ball: Nah, the audio you hear will be out of sync compared to you speaking
16/05/2020, 16:05 - / James Ball: Everyone always permanently out of sync with everyone else
16/05/2020, 16:05 - / James Ball: > latency
16/05/2020, 16:05 - Rob;: It might seem to your family like you're telling paedo over and over for no reason, but actually it's a great chant
16/05/2020, 16:06 - David;: If you all coordinated before hand though. E.g. we start the chant at exactly 3.41.10 on clock time.
16/05/2020, 16:06 - Rob;: To be fair it is often like this to a small extent in grounds and chants begin to spread. Often get one end a line ahead
16/05/2020, 16:06 - / James Ball: Might be possible if you had a chant whose length divided equally into the latency
16/05/2020, 16:06 - / James Ball: That's true
16/05/2020, 16:06 - / James Ball: Would be worse on grainy headsets when fat Mike starts up another round of you'll never walk alone
16/05/2020, 16:08 - Rob;: If the game is 30 mins  delayed, you could just line up all the chants at the sound desk before synching it to the feed
16/05/2020, 16:08 - Rob;: Worth it, I'm sure
16/05/2020, 16:09 - / James Ball: Theoretically possible but would need exact timing and some kind of sync signal. Also the latency will be variable so would likely need to be dynamically adjusted
16/05/2020, 16:10 - Rob;: You sound like the perfect man to sort it out, James
16/05/2020, 16:10 - / James Ball: IP networks (like The Internet) not designed for sync
16/05/2020, 16:11 - / James Ball: We use specialist networks for digital audio in the "pro audio" world. Or we used to when we had work
16/05/2020, 16:11 - Rob;: Or we could get every club to set up a hotel with 200 fans who have to live together and not see their families. Closed off from the world so they can be recorded watching the games
16/05/2020, 16:12 - / James Ball: More feasible
16/05/2020, 16:12 - David;: Was wondering about this re. the viability of a band playing a live set virtually with the members in different places. But think you would never have the timing exact enough to work for live music?
16/05/2020, 16:15 - / James Ball: It's been tried and is _being_ tried currently; usually to not much success. A skilled musician probably can pick out delay from between 50-100ms or better. It would sound out of time even with very low latency. Skype or Zoom latency is probably up to a few thousand milliseconds in the worst case and a few hundred in the best.
16/05/2020, 16:16 - / James Ball: Best option is to record each part separately and line them up in software. That's actually what's going on in the various videos on social media
16/05/2020, 16:22 - David;: Yeah, but not really the same you are not playing off the other performances
16/05/2020, 16:23 - / James Ball: Example. 120bpm is a common enough tempo for pop music. A semi quaver (16th note) therefore has a duration of 125ms. And that's not even a particularly fast rhythm
16/05/2020, 16:27 - David;: I guess the only thing that could work is you all start a metronome/rhythm track at exactly the same real-time moment. You record your own line over that while others do the same, and there is some software syncing your relative lags to put it together again - but you couldn't be listening to the other lines simultaneously
16/05/2020, 16:28 - / James Ball: A physical distance of about 43 metres already delays the audio by about 125ms
16/05/2020, 16:28 - / James Ball: Yeah, pretty much this
16/05/2020, 16:28 - / James Ball: At which point you've described a very complicated version of multi tracking
16/05/2020, 16:29 - David;: What's the latency on a big concert amp set up, between the guitar pluck and sound coming out of the amp
16/05/2020, 16:29 - David;: Yeah, it's basically just the process of recording an overdubbed multi-track just doing it simultaneously
16/05/2020, 16:31 - / James Ball: It's 100% noticeable but depends on which element you're referring to. Some of the digital desks display their latency. Some of the big Midas ones I like often operate in the 1-3ms range. Usually total latency from audio entering the mic to coming out the speakers is less than 10ms
16/05/2020, 16:31 - / James Ball: It must be low or else musicians wouldn't be able to use monitors
16/05/2020, 16:32 - / James Ball: Some of the shows I've done in say, the royal festival hall or the Barbican for example it's odd when I hear my own voice coming back from the PA, just due to my distance
16/05/2020, 16:33 - / James Ball: I will often use delay to adjust the system
16/05/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: For example delaying the audio coming out of speakers at the back of the hall to coincide with the audio arriving their from the main PA at the front. If it's not done it would sound weirdly delayed to the audience at the back
16/05/2020, 16:34 - / James Ball: Arriving there*
16/05/2020, 16:37 - / James Ball: Temporal analysis and adjustments actually make some of the biggest differences to sound with the least effort
16/05/2020, 16:37 - David;: Why doesn't this only work for the bit of the audience in the middle though?
16/05/2020, 16:38 - David;: Wouldn't those very close to either speaker get delay anyway
16/05/2020, 16:39 - / James Ball: Well you delay everything to the source and assume that sound (as electrical signals) propagates instantly to any loudspeakers.
16/05/2020, 16:41 - / James Ball: So in some hypothetical concert hall you have the stage then 5m in front of that you have some speakers and then 20m further back you have some more speakers. The first speakers are delayed by a few ms to match the stage, the ones at the back are delayed more to match their further distance
16/05/2020, 16:41 - David;: Right yeah
16/05/2020, 16:41 - David;: Makes sense
16/05/2020, 16:42 - / James Ball: The big speakers on towers at festivals are literally called delay towers
16/05/2020, 16:42 - Rob;: I've always reasoned in my head for large gigs that you would want to be close to a speaker, rather than at a point far from a speaker in front with one close behind you
16/05/2020, 16:42 - / James Ball: A well set up system that shouldn't matter
16/05/2020, 16:43 - / James Ball: But often there are huge time and spatial constraints that mean it does matter
16/05/2020, 16:43 - David;: Yeah according to the explanation you've given it's coming out of the further back speakers at the same time the delayed sound from the speakers in front would be reaching you
16/05/2020, 16:44 - / James Ball: Yeah exactly that
16/05/2020, 16:44 - / James Ball: You're talking milliseconds of delay but it's noticeable
16/05/2020, 16:45 - Rob;: Hate in venues with an upper tier where you have a very low ceiling on the ground floor beneath it. Gigs where I've got stuck in that bit have always sounded total shit
16/05/2020, 16:45 - / James Ball: Yep, the worst
16/05/2020, 16:46 - / James Ball: My rider with Saint Etienne states that under balcony mix positions are not acceptable
16/05/2020, 16:46 - Rob;: Haha
16/05/2020, 16:46 - David;: Like when we got trapped in that tent in the middle at Fatboy slim and couldn't hear anything
16/05/2020, 16:46 - Rob;: You are just in front when we came to St. Etienne
16/05/2020, 16:47 - / James Ball: Yeah, that wasn't too bad. SB empire is a reasonable venue. Quite reverberant though without audience
16/05/2020, 16:48 - Rob;: Julia actually likes it at the front of those under balcony bits as they are often raised so she can see better. I will try to avoid it unless we get there early enough to lean forward against a railing and get the proper sound
16/05/2020, 16:49 - Rob;: It's nice in that you never feel far away. The short multiple tiers create quite  a unique set of multiple front rows. Bit weird
16/05/2020, 16:49 - / James Ball: It can be great if you've got fills (smaller speakers "filling in the gaps") under there but often not. Biggest issue is that it's a bass trap
16/05/2020, 16:49 - Rob;: Brixton/Hammersmith style slanted floor is absolutely the best kind of venue
16/05/2020, 16:50 - / James Ball: Yeah, amphitheatre style
16/05/2020, 16:50 - Rob;: Have you ever done Alexandra Palace?
16/05/2020, 16:50 - Rob;: Most people complain about the sound, usually blaming the height
16/05/2020, 16:50 - / James Ball: Nope but I'm booked in for a show there in October if it's not cancelled
16/05/2020, 16:51 - David;: Like the back seat of Paul's old car. The bass trap.
16/05/2020, 16:51 - Rob;: They put these huge black hangings over the ceilings, I assume to try to fix it
16/05/2020, 16:51 - Rob;: The sound cage
16/05/2020, 16:52 - / James Ball: Yeah. They're on the venue rider I requested all drapes
16/05/2020, 16:52 - David;: Yeah. A torture chamber.
16/05/2020, 16:52 - David;: Oppressive
16/05/2020, 16:53 - Rob;: You used to feel like a second class citizen in the back. Unable to communicate with the elites in the front
16/05/2020, 16:53 - / James Ball: Put some music on at a moderate level through ok speakers that can actually reproduce bass. Stick your head in the corner of the room. You will notice the bass trap effect
16/05/2020, 16:54 - / James Ball: Opposite can be true in the centre of rooms. Bass dead spots.
16/05/2020, 16:55 - / James Ball: Blah blah standing waves, (de)constructive interference
16/05/2020, 17:59 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message

16/05/2020, 20:06 - / James Ball: leagu
16/05/2020, 20:11 - Damian Rumble: The words have been stemed to merge things like 'play' and 'playing'into the same thing
16/05/2020, 20:11 - Damian Rumble: Hence some words are missing the ends
16/05/2020, 20:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Is each graph a person?

16/05/2020, 20:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Gotcha
16/05/2020, 20:28 - Damian Rumble: I could break it down by persons if people are interested
16/05/2020, 20:37 - Phill: Damo, those graphs show cumulative use of the words

16/05/2020, 20:38 - Damian Rumble: Yes
16/05/2020, 21:14 - David;: Nice.
16/05/2020, 21:14 - David;: Mental - play a clear front runner. We always say play
16/05/2020, 21:19 - Rob;: Play and stay
16/05/2020, 21:19 - Rob;: Play everywhere. Stay.
16/05/2020, 21:20 - Sam;: Just telling Laura about the time my gas woke Dave up in air froust one. From a different room. She’s gone, laughing to hard.
16/05/2020, 21:21 - Rob;: Through two doors
16/05/2020, 21:22 - Sam;: The volume to fill before it needs to seep under the door
16/05/2020, 21:23 - Rob;: Yeah, hot air. Have to fart most of the volume of the flat to get down to Dave's nose level.
16/05/2020, 21:24 - Sam;: My door closed as well
16/05/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: The old gas alarm
16/05/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: DAVE. It's time to wake upppp. You're inside Sam's colonnnnnn.
16/05/2020, 22:38 - David;: Yeah, pungent enough to trigger a panic response
16/05/2020, 22:38 - David;: 2 rooms away
16/05/2020, 22:38 - David;: Because there was also the entire living area in between
16/05/2020, 23:52 - David;: Lol this is great. That had to let him have a mad one for sporting reasons. Only way he could possibly perform.
16/05/2020, 23:56 - David;: No way he could play without a huge bender in Vegas first.

17/05/2020, 09:11 - Rob;: His dead dad built a shed that met planning regulations, which is BAD
17/05/2020, 09:13 - Rob;: They turned it into a donkey sanctuary, which is somehow BAD.
17/05/2020, 10:46 - Stefan;: The very worst bit was when his mother lost the ability to walk so stopped going in the field
17/05/2020, 10:46 - Stefan;: What a waste of a field
17/05/2020, 10:49 - David;: Lol
17/05/2020, 10:50 - David;: Desperate. Good to see
17/05/2020, 10:58 - David;: 'thought to have a stake in a strip of scrubland'
17/05/2020, 11:05 - Stefan;: The Mail has done a screeching 180 from its usual position on the planning system and greenbelt development
17/05/2020, 11:06 - Stefan;: Oh, you won't ruin this green and pleasant land with a massive housing block? Traitor.
17/05/2020, 11:35 - David;: BBC News - Coronavirus: Dozens flout lockdown rules for Telford 'rave'
https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-52696720
17/05/2020, 11:35 - David;: Presume you attended Damo?
17/05/2020, 12:44 - Damian Rumble: Not great a party. At least the police were polite though. The DJ mainly played glitch and break beats which I'm not a massive fan of. 3/10
17/05/2020, 12:45 - Hamish Sinclair: I prefer a flan

18/05/2020, 11:18 - David;: If league 1s off then how can anything else finish as it fucks relegation and promotion through the pyramid
18/05/2020, 13:15 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-52702075
18/05/2020, 13:41 - Phill: The leagues which decide to abandon their season obviously give up their right to promotion. As league 1 and 2 now off, then there is no promotion to the championship and therefore no relegation from the championship (can’t see any championship clubs moaning about this). If prem and championship complete season then relegation and promotion still happen
18/05/2020, 13:42 - Phill: From and to the premier league
18/05/2020, 13:42 - Phill: Anything below league 2 is also presumably cancelled so there is no issue really
18/05/2020, 13:59 - David;: What if prem votes continue champ votes stop
18/05/2020, 14:02 - Jack G;: I presume they’d be champions in prem but no relegation in that scenario

18/05/2020, 14:09 - Paul;: Why is Stilton being hit so hard
18/05/2020, 14:10 - Paul;: Tearing the heart out of the cheese industry
18/05/2020, 14:16 - Rob;: Love a sweaty stilton in blazing hot weather
18/05/2020, 14:17 - Rob;: Happy to pick up the slack and make it my go-to food of the summer
18/05/2020, 14:17 - Phill: No relegation from prem, no promotion from championship
18/05/2020, 14:17 - / James Ball: Nice hot mouldy cheese
18/05/2020, 14:17 - Phill: Prem clubs love that scenario, champs clubs give up their right to promotion by voting on a club by club basis
18/05/2020, 14:18 - David;: Given we've sown up title it would be a pretty futile season
18/05/2020, 14:18 - David;: With no fans as well
18/05/2020, 14:19 - David;: Depending on what happens with Europe qualification there could be nothing left at stake

18/05/2020, 14:52 - David;: <Media omitted>
18/05/2020, 14:57 - Rob;: What pisses me off most about having Johnned it is how many countries are like 'it's odd because we used UK expertise to implement a version of their epidemic plan, which has worked relatively well for us'
18/05/2020, 14:58 - Rob;: We actually bothered to develop a good plan, then ran tests and recognised it had been underfunded and forgotten and still didn't fix it

18/05/2020, 20:28 - Phill: Watched first episode of last dance
18/05/2020, 20:28 - Phill: Big take away from the first episode is that America was quite cool in the 90’s and this documentary just highlights how much of a cesspit it’s become
18/05/2020, 20:33 - Phill: Lol Dennis Rodman ended his playing career at the Brighton Bears in 2016
18/05/2020, 20:33 - Paul;: Has anyone watched normal people?
18/05/2020, 20:34 - Phill: Tried. Just constant shagging.
18/05/2020, 20:34 - Phill: Becca watched it. I couldn’t be fucked. Millennial garbage.
18/05/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: It’s got extreme levels of buzz
18/05/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: Dangerously high
18/05/2020, 20:36 - Phill: It’s off the charts.
18/05/2020, 20:37 - David;: Watched it
18/05/2020, 20:38 - Rob;: Read it. Very good book. Watched it too. Enjoyed it. A lot of sex, yes.
18/05/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: Dave permanently watching the highest buzz programmes
18/05/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: The biggest fault was that they had a new Caribou song in a scene set 3 years ago at least. I immediately set out on foot to deliver my complaint letter to Ofcom in person.
18/05/2020, 20:43 - David;: I don't know where you get your buzz from
18/05/2020, 20:43 - David;: None of it's making it my way in lockdown
18/05/2020, 20:43 - David;: It's a hermetically sealed buzz chamber
18/05/2020, 20:43 - / James Ball: Digetic or non digetic?
18/05/2020, 20:43 - David;: Noticed this instantly as well
18/05/2020, 20:44 - Rob;: Digetic
18/05/2020, 20:48 - Hamish Sinclair: Its bullshit
18/05/2020, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: Had I watched without the hype would have given it a 7/10 and approved of the sexual references
18/05/2020, 20:49 - Hamish Sinclair: But too much hype, drops it tona 5
18/05/2020, 20:57 - David;: That's the principle of buzz
18/05/2020, 20:57 - David;: Text book case
18/05/2020, 20:58 - Jack G;: Is there a cycle to it? So if more and more people saying it’s crap because too much buzz then it becomes an option again?
18/05/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Buzz is a cancer
18/05/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: I won't engage with it as a concept
18/05/2020, 21:09 - Rob;: Can't get bogged down in other people's opinions
18/05/2020, 21:10 - Phill: Does that mean that you’ll let go of the opinion that Arsenal are still relevant?

Me - "neither does Priti Patel"
19/05/2020, 14:11 - Rob;: New plan for football atmosphere
19/05/2020, 14:14 - Rob;: You mic up one large family. Multiply their voices to around 45,000 different copies, slightly skewing them so they don't all happen at once, altering the pitches to get a normal range of voices - your old men, young men, child-men, wo-men, your gays, travelling business men.
19/05/2020, 14:14 - Rob;: Instant atmosphere
19/05/2020, 14:14 - Rob;: Ever cheer is crowd cheer
19/05/2020, 14:15 - / James Ball: Stefan how do you feel about gays having markedly different voices from men?
19/05/2020, 14:25 - Stefan;: There's already been a documentary about it
https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/a-man-finds-out-the-the-link-between-his-homosexuality-and-his-gay-voice-in-new-documentary-a6711186.html
19/05/2020, 14:26 - Stefan;: I'm more interested in "travelling businessman" voice
19/05/2020, 14:32 - David;: What was the conclusion?
19/05/2020, 14:33 - David;: This would sound mental. Like a lunatic aslum of whispering and talking. They wouldn't be cheering properly.
19/05/2020, 14:33 - / James Ball: It's actually done more often than you think
19/05/2020, 14:33 - / James Ball: Most crowd noise in film/TV is usually only a few people
19/05/2020, 14:34 - David;: Yes but those people presumably know they are trying to produce crowd noise not just randomly recorded in their living room watching a game?
19/05/2020, 14:35 - / James Ball: Yes true
19/05/2020, 14:36 - David;: It would end up being a lot of 'Barry can you fetch the pringles', all said in the same way but slightly delayed and pitched differently.
19/05/2020, 14:36 - David;: I.e. completely mental
19/05/2020, 14:36 - Paul;: Lol
19/05/2020, 14:37 - David;: 'I'm just going for a shit can we pause' - overlayed on top of its self 20,000 times
19/05/2020, 14:38 - David;: Great accurate crowd noise. You'd never notice the difference.
19/05/2020, 14:40 - Stefan;: Here’s a song for you… It's Gonna Rain, Part II (1965) by Steve Reich
https://open.spotify.com/track/3B9GLWmWBmjDyxjXSdR0Hv?si=ijkJPtHGSCiMnOUZ3qVE4Q
Steve Reich already did this in the 60s and it's completely fucking mental
19/05/2020, 14:40 - Stefan;: Skip to about 2:30
19/05/2020, 14:40 - / James Ball: Classic
19/05/2020, 14:41 - Rob;: I think we need to try it for at least one major game before we just wave it away
19/05/2020, 14:41 - / James Ball: Wrote an essay on Steve Reich at uni
19/05/2020, 14:41 - Stefan;: Great choice, man was a genius
19/05/2020, 14:42 - David;: Surely better idea: you just use the audio from past games in that stadium, chop it up into bits that correspond to certain scenarios and tag them - e.g. 'goalmouth scramble', 'slowly building move out of defence', 'yellow card on home player' etc. then have somebody mapping those to events in the new live game in real time, and a smoothing algorithm that can transition between them somehow.
19/05/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: Unworkable
19/05/2020, 14:43 - Rob;: Next
19/05/2020, 14:43 - / James Ball: So you're saying play back the Fifa or pes soundtrack?
19/05/2020, 14:43 - David;: But with audio from actual matches at that ground
19/05/2020, 14:43 - David;: Could even get the audio from that specific fixture to generate any local rivalry dynamics
19/05/2020, 14:43 - Paul;: Sounds like the best idea out of complete shit so far
19/05/2020, 14:44 - David;: So we're stuck with the eternal echoing mutter?
19/05/2020, 14:46 - David;: As fans can we claim the crowd atmosphere is our IP and mount a class action lawsuit?
19/05/2020, 14:47 - David;: So work out how much less TV games are worth without crowd noise, and claim the difference.
19/05/2020, 14:49 - Stefan;: Yeah this sounds very straightforward, legally speaking
19/05/2020, 14:49 - David;: I dont see any problems
19/05/2020, 15:00 - Rob;: But hearing yer Nan ask who that player with the daft hair is 45,000 times at every human pitch
19/05/2020, 15:03 - Paul;: How large a family are you anticipating on finding? Searching out a cult or commune might yield better results?
19/05/2020, 15:04 - Rob;: The system is flawless, so the data you feed in doesn't matter
19/05/2020, 15:29 - David;: I think this is a flawed assumption
19/05/2020, 15:52 - Damian Rumble: I mean... Don't they do this in FIFA video games? Probably would be workable
19/05/2020, 18:59 - Paul;: What day of lockdown are we on now

19/05/2020, 19:10 - / James Ball: Looks good. I just bought a load of meat for BBQage tomorrow
19/05/2020, 19:10 - Phill: Since 12 March for me so I’ve lost count

19/05/2020, 19:21 - Phill: Double stack that cunt.
19/05/2020, 19:21 - Rob;: Choices. Not all traditional. Chimmichurri, slaw or minted yogurt

19/05/2020, 20:03 - Rob;: That is a correct coarseness of cheese and a correct amount
19/05/2020, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: We were just about to have a BBQ and then Sarah's noisey neighbour put his long neck over the fence and told us we the estate owner doesn't allow it, and that he would report us if we went ahead with it.
19/05/2020, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: The BBQ has been there for over a year now
19/05/2020, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: Such a prick

19/05/2020, 23:06 - David;: Too much
19/05/2020, 23:10 - David;: He wears all the football shirts. Inter, Chelsea, Liverpool
19/05/2020, 23:37 - Damian Rumble: Oh no... Headlines not looking so good Boris. Better knight the man who did more to save save the NHS than 10 years of Tory rule
20/05/2020, 00:07 - Hamish Sinclair: Really got into old episodes of shooting stars
20/05/2020, 00:08 - Hamish Sinclair: The bit where vic Reeves imitates songs by club singing, some real honking
20/05/2020, 00:20 - David;: Lol isn't there a whole feature built around the premise of him just hibbing?
20/05/2020, 00:21 - David;: I like how ulrika Johnson was just there for them to grot over
20/05/2020, 00:22 - David;: Did it for multiple seasons.

20/05/2020, 11:16 - Paul;: Lol are you ready for a captain Tom award to be rolled out
20/05/2020, 11:17 - David;: Sick of it. Obviously we'll now have to endure a huge state funeral probably.
20/05/2020, 11:17 - David;: We'll never hear the end of it.
20/05/2020, 11:18 - Paul;: But Dave, everyone is in awe
20/05/2020, 11:19 - David;: He walked down his garden path. Next.
20/05/2020, 11:19 - Paul;: People just can’t hold themselves back at how much awe they have
20/05/2020, 11:27 - / James Ball: I can't say I've listened to all of it
20/05/2020, 11:28 - / James Ball: Interesting as an experiment into synthesizers though
20/05/2020, 11:35 - David;: Yeah was watching a documentary called I dream of wires which is a history of the synth. Listened to it's it's completely mental.
20/05/2020, 11:39 - David;: Was interesting where they were highlighting philosophical differences in early synth design. Moog saying basically make it look like an electric piano and Buchla saying this is a completely new way of making music and putting it back into regular scales would restrict innovation

20/05/2020, 20:35 - / James Ball: True

20/05/2020, 22:49 - / James Ball: I think just go back to the 1930 ball one game a season
20/05/2020, 22:49 - / James Ball: Spice things up a bit
20/05/2020, 22:50 - / James Ball: The 1970 ball is very wholesome. Very pure

21/05/2020, 10:25 - David;: Something about this explanation made me more suspicious that he had been partying
21/05/2020, 10:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Just signed up to hydroxychloroquine study. If it's good enough for trump ite good enough for me
21/05/2020, 11:19 - David;: But you don't have the disease?
21/05/2020, 11:20 - David;: Are you in a control group or something
21/05/2020, 11:26 - Phill: Think the trial is to see if the drug prevents infection
21/05/2020, 11:28 - David;: Ah okay I thought it was to reduce severity of symptoms
21/05/2020, 11:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Looking at whether it can prevent/reduce symptoms
21/05/2020, 11:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Have to go through screening first, and 50% chance I get placebo
21/05/2020, 11:35 - David;: So you would be taking it regularly and then if you were to get it they evaluate the effects it has vs the group given the placebo?
21/05/2020, 11:35 - David;: Or you only take it if you get it
21/05/2020, 11:39 - Damian Rumble: Are you getting paid for this?
21/05/2020, 11:40 - Damian Rumble: Not sure why you would willing go through with this (apart from humiliating trump)
21/05/2020, 11:42 - Hamish Sinclair: you take it regularly for 3months and they will  track symptoms. They'll then compare the number of people diagnosed in each group and compare symptom severity etc
21/05/2020, 14:20 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
21/05/2020, 14:31 - Phill: Nice, what terms did you get on the mortgage to afford that?
21/05/2020, 14:42 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
21/05/2020, 14:43 - Hamish Sinclair: Men in tight trousers?
21/05/2020, 14:44 - Rob;: And no socks
21/05/2020, 14:44 - Rob;: Borrowing quite heavily from gay style, but doing it worse and being super laddy with it
21/05/2020, 14:45 - Hamish Sinclair: The third guy as you go left to right is particularly bad
21/05/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: All Bar One is the perfect backdrop
21/05/2020, 14:46 - Hamish Sinclair: Is this male fiat 500?
21/05/2020, 14:46 - Rob;: Definitely crossover
21/05/2020, 14:47 - Rob;: I would guess definitely Kent/Essex, whereas we were pinning Fiat 500 more Midlands
21/05/2020, 14:47 - Paul;: Newcastle as well
21/05/2020, 15:00 - Stefan;: It's generic regional Fiat 500. Imitates gay fashion insofar as that means tight fit and lot of skin showing, but the actual style is dogshit
21/05/2020, 15:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Isnt the whole issue with this that there is NO style in this, the entire outfit is designed to show that they're built
21/05/2020, 15:02 - Hamish Sinclair: As long as it does that style is irrelevent
21/05/2020, 15:08 - Stefan;: Basically yes. What they have borrowed heavily from the gays is a massive focus on being built and showing it
21/05/2020, 15:09 - Rob;: But crucially ignored the idea of things being a good fit
21/05/2020, 15:09 - Rob;: Or having enough room for your phone
21/05/2020, 15:12 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah the bulge top of thigh looks amateur

21/05/2020, 16:46 - David;: Is there a straight otter analogue as well?
21/05/2020, 16:47 - David;: Or they've only borrowed from the bears
21/05/2020, 16:48 - David;: Irony is I can imagine them all being quite homophobic

21/05/2020, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: That's a great spot
21/05/2020, 16:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Face takes up less than 2/3
21/05/2020, 16:58 - Stefan;: Hard to map a close analogue. The best fit is probably the the "Clapham muscle queen" look, but with even less style
21/05/2020, 17:00 - David;: The colour choices he's made are hard to get past
21/05/2020, 17:01 - David;: ha, not familiar with this particular look

22/05/2020, 20:30 - Rob;: 8 miles was about where it kicked in

23/05/2020, 08:30 - Hamish Sinclair: Should probably state that I have no real interest or belief in hydroxychloroquine. But randomised trial data would be useful and toxicity in healthy volunteers minimal

23/05/2020, 14:37 - Paul;: How does he not think that that wasn’t the coronavirus
23/05/2020, 14:39 - Rob;: So despite knowing he had it, and having had no symptoms since, he still doesn't believe the unexplained pneumomia was when he had it?
23/05/2020, 14:40 - Paul;: No couldn’t possibly have been it
23/05/2020, 15:56 - / James Ball: I know 5 people including my parents' neighbour that had pneumonia in December/January  and only one considers that it could have been covid

23/05/2020, 16:58 - Stefan;: They've reopened now though, I went to my local on Thursday
23/05/2020, 16:59 - Phill: Yeah but becca is high risk so not allowed anywhere until end of June
23/05/2020, 17:03 - Phill: I pop to the local garage to get a few tinnies now and again, but she’s not been out since mid March and all food has been delivered
23/05/2020, 17:14 - David;: When's 12 weeks up?
23/05/2020, 17:15 - Phill: The 12 week thing is arbitrary, the letters from her healthcare provider state a minimum end date
23/05/2020, 17:15 - Phill: Which is currently end of June
23/05/2020, 17:15 - Phill: Will likely be extended
23/05/2020, 17:15 - David;: Shit storm
23/05/2020, 17:16 - Phill: I guess with the T cell discovery that will change things also, her treatment destroyed T cells and they don’t repopulate for years

24/05/2020, 01:33 - David;: Family night in. Sounds cosy. Where are you scoring ket in lock down?

24/05/2020, 09:49 - Sam;: I hope the need for a dump was fabricated just to lead to the photo.
24/05/2020, 10:02 - Hamish Sinclair: This is my suspicion
24/05/2020, 10:02 - Hamish Sinclair: The dump actually a lie
24/05/2020, 10:07 - Rob;: Working at an estate agent just for a bit would be so elightening
24/05/2020, 10:07 - Rob;: The amount of shit that must go on

24/05/2020, 12:49 - Paul;: Watch nausica next
24/05/2020, 17:04 - Damian Rumble: Watching Boris try to explain Domonic cummings's transgressions
24/05/2020, 17:05 - Sam;: Biggest pressy for a while
24/05/2020, 17:05 - Damian Rumble: >Dominic acted with integrity
24/05/2020, 17:13 - Damian Rumble: Worst defense ever. People are angry about government hypocrisy over lock down rules. However I think Dominic is a top bloke. So, therefore, we are not going to talk about it any more.
24/05/2020, 17:13 - Jack G;: The fact that Dom has gotten away with this surely puts an end to any sort of lockdown

25/05/2020, 08:56 - Phill: When I say Formula E, I don’t mean the electric version. I mean the VR gaming versions
25/05/2020, 08:59 - David;: Couldn't get close to it
25/05/2020, 09:00 - David;: Should be q version where all the drivers are on MDMA

25/05/2020, 17:28 - Sam;: I had it on the radio, just put on the tv. Cummings behind a shitty tressle table in the corner of a garden
25/05/2020, 17:28 - Sam;: Makes it somehow more bullish than a more official set up
25/05/2020, 18:01 - Rob;: Quite prince Andrew when you sum it up: My wife and I were worried my illness had affected my eyesight, making it unsafe to drive, so we decided to test this by driving on an excursion to a local beauty spot, with our son with us, as a sort of eye test. It took over an hour for this test to be carried out and we did get out of the car at the beauty spot, yes.
25/05/2020, 18:02 - Rob;: My son needed a wee on that occasion, which is why we stopped, but he didn't need one in the initial 260 mile drive from London to Durham.
25/05/2020, 18:12 - Jack G;: Surely there’s now a legal precedent for everyone to dispute the fines they’ve been given for breaking lockdown. Shitstorm

26/05/2020, 16:57 - / James Ball: So they've achieved a similar death rate to us despite being a vastly less urban country
26/05/2020, 17:49 - / James Ball: Also is it even possible to compare countries like that given different reporting methods for deaths

26/05/2020, 18:15 - Damian Rumble: More that you can probably adequately compare Norway, Sweden and Denmark as nations to see the difference in having a comprehensive lockdown verses not having one (at least on death rate)

26/05/2020, 20:50 - Rob;: Getting it to break with a domestic cat rather than eat it seems like a challenge
26/05/2020, 20:50 - David;: Its of that size where it hovers between dangerous and cute.
26/05/2020, 20:50 - David;: There's an edge to it

27/05/2020, 11:31 - / James Ball: About 4 or 5 small ones as well
27/05/2020, 11:33 - Rob;: Sell them on eBay, see if any wasps are interested. You could save them a lot of work
27/05/2020, 11:48 - / James Ball: I actually tried picking up the big one when we moved in. It didn't weigh anything and just turned to dust where my fingers touched it

27/05/2020, 15:13 - Rob;: Killed the wasps that made a nest in the wall near my bedroom for money. Gassed them too

27/05/2020, 15:14 - Rob;: There's a fox killing the moles in the field currently
27/05/2020, 15:15 - Rob;: I imagine Mick is pro fox hunting so there's less competition for mole killing

27/05/2020, 16:09 - / James Ball: But he has the gas to also gas the foxes

27/05/2020, 17:45 - / James Ball: Just some extra keys and lower register?
27/05/2020, 17:48 - / James Ball: https://youtu.be/dHj5YGimzbs

The clarinet family is huge enough to allow for this hilariously mismatched duet
27/05/2020, 17:51 - / James Ball: Ah good. Enjoy a nice contrabass wind
27/05/2020, 19:30 - David;: So you have puffed a clarinet? Just to be clear
27/05/2020, 19:31 - David;: <Media omitted>
27/05/2020, 19:31 - David;: The grot
27/05/2020, 19:41 - Stefan;: Yes but I didn't inhale and I didn't enjoy it

27/05/2020, 23:00 - Damian Rumble: I have not
27/05/2020, 23:45 - Stefan;: I've been several times, Primavera is great

28/05/2020, 14:08 - Rob;: Phil and I cooked a huge ragu while Sambo and Daffy watched a match. We were only running in for goals then getting description of the play from them
28/05/2020, 14:09 - Rob;: But by the end of the night u was having to retell the details of the match back to Dave
28/05/2020, 14:10 - Rob;: Howling everywhere
28/05/2020, 14:10 - Phill: Was this the night Sam threw up in my newly decorated bedroom?
28/05/2020, 14:11 - Phill: Then came down covered in vomit into the living room in his pissed pants
28/05/2020, 14:12 - Sam;: A night so uuuuge we forgot it

28/05/2020, 14:16 - Phill: No memory
28/05/2020, 14:16 - Phill: Couldn’t say
28/05/2020, 14:16 - Rob;: Just the reaction of Dave to being squeezed in the picture
28/05/2020, 14:17 - Rob;: Had some real booze inside him. Didn't appreciate the squeeze
28/05/2020, 14:17 - Paul;: Just howled as a reaction
28/05/2020, 14:23 - David;: It was a really big Ragu
28/05/2020, 14:23 - David;: Hard to come back from
28/05/2020, 14:23 - David;: Was this the same night Sam vommed in the cabinet of important mortgage documents?
28/05/2020, 14:23 - Sam;: There was no pissing
28/05/2020, 14:23 - David;: Your honour
28/05/2020, 14:24 - Sam;: The vomiting was a different night.
28/05/2020, 14:29 - Phill: Nah you came downstairs covered in vomit and piss.
28/05/2020, 14:30 - Phill: Eating pizza crusts and drinking fosters post vom
28/05/2020, 14:31 - Jack G;: The sunglasses on too?
28/05/2020, 14:32 - Phill: Nah just black boxers, pissed on, water in the hair and on the face in an attempt to wash the vomit away, eating pizza and drinking fosters. Walks into the living room and says “I’ve done bad”
28/05/2020, 14:33 - Paul;: What time is this at?
28/05/2020, 14:33 - David;: It coudnt have happened to a nicer guy
28/05/2020, 14:33 - Phill: Like 1AM or something
28/05/2020, 14:33 - Paul;: Done bad
28/05/2020, 14:33 - Phill: Everyone else was winding down with a joint
28/05/2020, 14:34 - Phill: Then we suddenly had to deal with that
28/05/2020, 14:34 - David;: Was this same night as the vomming on the documents?
28/05/2020, 14:34 - David;: Or different.
28/05/2020, 14:34 - Phill: Yeah
28/05/2020, 14:34 - Phill: Same
28/05/2020, 14:35 - Jack G;: Something happened bad

28/05/2020, 14:39 - / James Ball: might need to refer to the vom at a later date
28/05/2020, 15:28 - Jack G;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/52833725
28/05/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: Have people aren't he interview Matt Hancock gave with sky where he tried to laugh through it to make the questions seem ludicrous, but actually comes across like he's at peak of a massive MDMA high?
28/05/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: *seen the interview
28/05/2020, 16:23 - Rob;: https://twitter.com/DrRosena/status/1265922329462411265?s=19
28/05/2020, 16:24 - Jack G;: Yeah seen that - he’s trending as the “death minister” on Twitter
28/05/2020, 16:24 - Rob;: That fucking Queen print background too.
28/05/2020, 16:24 - Rob;: Lol. The grinning face of death, high as tits
28/05/2020, 16:57 - David;: Ah no.
28/05/2020, 16:57 - David;: That's gone very wrong. Failing to impersonate a human
28/05/2020, 17:00 - Paul;: Lol just pissing himself at that
28/05/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 17:16 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 17:17 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 17:17 - Rob;: Most deaths in Europe
28/05/2020, 17:17 - Rob;: Highest death rate in the world
28/05/2020, 17:18 - Rob;: We through a protective ring around the care homes
28/05/2020, 17:20 - David;: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 17:20 - David;: Lol the incredible break out tour
28/05/2020, 17:21 - David;: Saville and Harris
28/05/2020, 17:36 - David;: So only 6.4% have had corona. That's a piece of shit
28/05/2020, 17:36 - David;: Not even close to a herd.
28/05/2020, 17:36 - David;: A gaggle at best
28/05/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: Yeah, and if resistance lasts for 3 months like with other Corona viruses, the herd will actually get smaller
28/05/2020, 18:21 - Phill: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 18:40 - Rob;: Getting all 92 remaining games televised is a pretty good outcome of corona
28/05/2020, 18:58 - Rob;: 4 live on BBC
28/05/2020, 19:01 - Rob;: Of Sky's 64 matches, 25 will be free to watch
28/05/2020, 19:07 - / James Ball: Lockdown easing then
28/05/2020, 19:08 - / James Ball: BBQs now allowed
28/05/2020, 19:20 - Rob;: Not sure they really waited long enough to see if the initial relaxing of rules has led to more infections yet, given the delay in symptoms and reporting, but hey ho
28/05/2020, 19:35 - David;: That's quite randomhow did this happen
28/05/2020, 19:35 - Rob;: Suddenly ally he games were up for grabs
28/05/2020, 19:36 - David;: Is it the 3 oclocks that are free i.e. ones they didn't buy rights to in the first place?
28/05/2020, 19:37 - Rob;: Not sure which ones will be free to air. They all start as 3pm games then get moved when a broadcaster requests to show them, usually a month or two in advance, so the last few games may not actually have been picked for telly before lockdown happened
28/05/2020, 19:38 - Rob;: Sometimes it's quite short notice - i've bought tickets for a 3 pm game and had it moved when selected for TV before
28/05/2020, 19:38 - David;: But don't see how it was all up for grabs they bought all those fixtures they're just happening on a different date.
28/05/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: But now there are no 3pm games and more, so suddenly there are loads more games allowed to be shown
28/05/2020, 19:39 - David;: Yes, but the original lunch time and late slots are the same I guess? But now with all these new shittier fixtures also televisdd
28/05/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: No crowds = no attendance to protect or police considerations = no 3pm games = every game available to show
28/05/2020, 19:40 - Rob;: They only get moved in lunch/late slots a month or two in advance
28/05/2020, 19:40 - Rob;: When the fixture list first comes out, they're all 3pm
28/05/2020, 19:41 - David;: Yeah but they buy the rights to that many games it's irrelevant which they then pick. They know they will get x amount of lunch time games, Sunday games etc.
28/05/2020, 19:41 - Rob;: Well yeah, but not there were more games to buy
28/05/2020, 19:41 - Rob;: *now there are more to buy
28/05/2020, 19:41 - Rob;: And yes, they will probably be the shitter games
28/05/2020, 19:42 - David;: Yeah, so the rights for the originals I presume are unchanged but now all the other shit is also televised
28/05/2020, 19:42 - Rob;: Yeah, Sky and BT have the same number they had, and will have bought more. BBC bought 4
28/05/2020, 19:42 - David;: Which sometimes to be fair are good fixtures at 3 o'clock.
28/05/2020, 19:42 - David;: Lol. This.
28/05/2020, 19:42 - David;: Dipping a shitty toe in
28/05/2020, 19:43 - Rob;: But maybe they went for fewer better games?
28/05/2020, 19:43 - Rob;: They're getting schedules every day too, so no more weekend rounds
28/05/2020, 19:44 - David;: BBC will be showing all the brexit grot. Your Burnley vs Newcastles
28/05/2020, 19:44 - David;: So do they have a schedule up to the end of the season yey
28/05/2020, 19:44 - David;: *yet
28/05/2020, 19:45 - David;: Has anyone said anything about the champs league yet?
28/05/2020, 19:47 - David;: That's huge. Prem football every day
28/05/2020, 19:47 - David;: From famine to feast
28/05/2020, 19:47 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 19:48 - Rob;: Like a premier league world cup
28/05/2020, 19:48 - David;: That Saturday. Late breakfast then you never have to stop watching football again
28/05/2020, 19:48 - David;: Takes you through to MotD
28/05/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: Sleep in until 11:30 then up in time for the early game on Sunday
28/05/2020, 19:49 - David;: Yep and then bedded in until 9 that evening
28/05/2020, 19:50 - Rob;: There will be at least one team that was good that goes total shit and at least one dump team that gets great
28/05/2020, 19:50 - David;: Fantasy football is a write off
28/05/2020, 19:50 - David;: How do you get close to this?
28/05/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: I guess the say the game week starts on Friday?
28/05/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: But possibly fucked, yes
28/05/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: There will be lazy players who've for fat in lockdown
28/05/2020, 19:52 - David;: I more mean what's good anymore.
28/05/2020, 19:52 - David;: Who's injured, what are starting XIs.
28/05/2020, 19:52 - David;: Who's in form.
28/05/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: Spurs got all those injured players back. They were fucked
28/05/2020, 19:53 - David;: Kane.
28/05/2020, 19:53 - Rob;: He's able now
28/05/2020, 19:53 - David;: Could suddenly be a thing again
28/05/2020, 19:53 - Rob;: The prodigal Son's returned too
28/05/2020, 19:53 - David;: Could have worked well for England because we were looking fucked going into the euros
28/05/2020, 19:54 - Rob;: We're getting a centre half we bought then loaned back to league 1, because league 1 is dead now
28/05/2020, 19:55 - David;: Are they still paying his wages?
28/05/2020, 19:55 - Rob;: Don't think so. Loan terminated I guess
28/05/2020, 19:55 - David;: All quite a hilariously mental situation
28/05/2020, 19:55 - Rob;: We wanted him anyway he was loaned as a condition of sale, rather than because he needed experience
28/05/2020, 20:01 - Paul;: The clapping
28/05/2020, 20:02 - Sam;: The final time
28/05/2020, 20:02 - Sam;: Thank fuck
28/05/2020, 20:02 - Paul;: I thought you’d have been all over the clapping. The balcony of clap
28/05/2020, 20:08 - Sam;: Yeah I famously love clapping...
28/05/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: Why the final time?
28/05/2020, 20:36 - / James Ball: The originator said it was time to stop it
28/05/2020, 20:37 - Rob;: Ah brilliant
28/05/2020, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Apparently they said public had shown thier appreciation and it was now time for the politicians to reward them
28/05/2020, 21:59 - David;: I wanted to mutate into a minute of hate like in 1984
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Paul;: Someone did try and get a boo for boris so we almost had it
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Paul;: Almost hit 1984
28/05/2020, 22:00 - Paul;: Damo probably did it
28/05/2020, 22:05 - David;: With the 'free' sky games do you still have to have the basic sky package though?
28/05/2020, 22:05 - Paul;: @447875303402
28/05/2020, 22:06 - Paul;: @447540496004
28/05/2020, 22:06 - David;: @447969894197
28/05/2020, 22:06 - David;: One thing I do miss from the old thread is the nicknames.
28/05/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: Just do the now tv
28/05/2020, 22:08 - David;: But then money doe
28/05/2020, 22:09 - Rob;: It will probably be free to stream on now tv
28/05/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: It’s £25 or something for a month
28/05/2020, 22:09 - David;: Is that no free Jenny
28/05/2020, 22:09 - Paul;: More free than a sky annual subscription
28/05/2020, 22:10 - Rob;: Sky often puts forts game of the season on a random Freeview channel
28/05/2020, 22:11 - David;: So by offering it 'free' they're actually roping everyone into to the clutches of now tv
28/05/2020, 22:11 - David;: Cunning
28/05/2020, 22:12 - Paul;: Yeah rob you know about this free option from sky
28/05/2020, 22:12 - Paul;: How does it work
28/05/2020, 22:12 - Paul;: You said 25 games free
28/05/2020, 22:12 - David;: @447969894197
28/05/2020, 22:12 - David;: That's what you claimed
28/05/2020, 22:12 - Rob;: For streaming I imagine you'll need a nowtv log in but not a subscription
28/05/2020, 22:13 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 22:13 - Paul;: We need more information
28/05/2020, 22:14 - Paul;: You’ve sold us down the river rob
28/05/2020, 22:14 - Paul;: And left us clutching turds in both hands
28/05/2020, 22:14 - Rob;: That's all the information
28/05/2020, 22:14 - Rob;: It'll be free
28/05/2020, 22:15 - David;: Free to air. A free to air missile.
28/05/2020, 22:15 - David;: But I need it on the ground. In my bonce. It's no good to me in the air
28/05/2020, 22:16 - Paul;: You’ve really fucked us @447969894197
28/05/2020, 22:17 - David;: Free to air but thousands of pounds to get it on your TV screen. Pounds to screen, free to air.
28/05/2020, 22:18 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
28/05/2020, 22:18 - Paul;: I think it’s just extra on top of a subscription
28/05/2020, 22:19 - Rob;: The whole nation
28/05/2020, 22:19 - Paul;: Free that you weren’t expecting
28/05/2020, 22:19 - Paul;: Maybe now tv is the answer
28/05/2020, 22:22 - David;: >pick
28/05/2020, 22:22 - David;: Seems like that's a freeview channel
28/05/2020, 22:22 - Rob;: Yep. FREEview
28/05/2020, 22:22 - Rob;: Free to view
28/05/2020, 22:22 - David;: So you could watch without a basic sky subscription. However I don't have a freeview tv
28/05/2020, 22:23 - David;: Can you stream freeview?
28/05/2020, 22:23 - Rob;: Yes

28/05/2020, 22:24 - David;: Only internet and a projector.
28/05/2020, 22:24 - David;: Anything not streamable is dead to me
28/05/2020, 22:24 - Rob;: Sky are making those matches free for the advertising bunce. They will make it free to stream on their website and apps. Maybe YouTube channel like the champions League final
28/05/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: BBC News on the projector

28/05/2020, 22:26 - Rob;: Lottery
28/05/2020, 22:26 - David;: Watch stuff that's worth projecting. Don't watch shite. It's a good filter
28/05/2020, 22:26 - Phill: Should we be tentatively planning a wales? August Banky again?
28/05/2020, 22:27 - David;: Potentially but bank holiday traffic was fucking grim last year
28/05/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: Was the renovation meant to be completed this year?
28/05/2020, 22:27 - David;: That obviously hasn't happened now
28/05/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: Guess we'll all have accrued holiday
28/05/2020, 22:28 - Paul;: Better to go on non banky
28/05/2020, 22:36 - Phill: Why so much hate for the banky?
28/05/2020, 22:36 - Phill: Free holiday and a short week to recover the following week

01/06/2020, 08:42 - Damian Rumble: Surely trump has got to be finished after all of this. Economy down the pan. Not a clue when dealing with the pandemic. Jobs lost in a pointless trade war with China. Losing control of law and order following more racism from the police. And finally a democrat who's so bland that just about anyone can imagine voting for him.

01/06/2020, 11:10 - / James Ball: Why are you even due this? Could you vote when you were there?
01/06/2020, 11:11 - Paul;: Probably just because I was on the tax role
01/06/2020, 11:13 - Rob;: Can you not get it cashed and keep it if they stamp it void after?
01/06/2020, 11:13 - Rob;: Quite an expensive memento otherwise
01/06/2020, 13:00 - Damian Rumble: Take a photo copy. Frame that and cash the cheque I reckon

02/06/2020, 12:11 - / James Ball: Yeah deep frying too messy and too wasteful. Results are basically the same from oven

02/06/2020, 20:20 - / James Ball: Pretty sure the couple opposite us are having a breakup. Have heard them shouting a bit over the past few weeks and he's now just sat in his car slumped on the steering wheel
02/06/2020, 20:21 - Phill: Lol
02/06/2020, 20:21 - Phill: Go out and offer him an old locky
02/06/2020, 20:21 - Phill: Damo, this triggers me. The proximity of the raw to the salad.

04/06/2020, 12:46 - Damian Rumble: I am really struggling to see Boris surviving until the 2024 election. The only thing that might keep him in place is that the Tories have no other obvious leaders.
04/06/2020, 12:52 - Rob;: If our death rate doesn't go down and we keep recording hundreds of deaths while the rest of Europe get less than us combined, in a normal logical world everyone would turn on him, right?

04/06/2020, 12:58 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
04/06/2020, 13:00 - Damian Rumble: I think the Dominic Cummings scandal and woken up a fair number of Tories up to the reality that Boris is not the Messiah. Combined with the fact for the first time in 10 years labour is not being run by someone they perceive as a Marxist.
04/06/2020, 13:01 - Damian Rumble: Yes the timing of that was quite suspicious...

05/06/2020, 16:56 - Rob;: (or well projected reality)
05/06/2020, 16:58 - Rob;: Best to end lockdown before it's worked
05/06/2020, 16:58 - Rob;: Best to get the economic fucking AND the deaths

05/06/2020, 17:03 - Damian Rumble: I seem to recall the 20,000 deaths figure originally thought with respect to the estimate that up to 60% of the population could get the virus. Last time I checked this was currently at around 7%. Still much more fucking to go...
05/06/2020, 17:04 - Rob;: I love the argument that Brexit is less risky now because the economy is already fucked, so it will do less damage

05/06/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: Yeah I think individual councils are in charge
05/06/2020, 20:28 - Paul;: I think I read that or heard that?
05/06/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: The one in the south west has been skewed by a hospital outbreak, so in that case you just clear that uo
05/06/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: Not sure
05/06/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: They got funding to decentralise it where needed
05/06/2020, 20:29 - Phill: The based west
05/06/2020, 20:29 - Paul;: So it doesn’t locky everyone
05/06/2020, 20:29 - Rob;: The one in the north west is much broader
05/06/2020, 20:30 - Paul;: What’s even in the north west?
05/06/2020, 20:30 - Paul;: Liverpool?
05/06/2020, 20:30 - Paul;: Lake District?
05/06/2020, 20:32 - Stefan;: The K number is the new big thing now. How variable the R rate is between individuals, whether you've got your superspreaders
05/06/2020, 20:33 - Paul;: Your Typhoid Marys?
05/06/2020, 20:33 - Paul;: Your covid Jacks
05/06/2020, 20:34 - Paul;: Isn’t measles an R30?
05/06/2020, 20:34 - Paul;: What’s a K #?
05/06/2020, 20:34 - Paul;: Ket number
05/06/2020, 20:36 - Rob;: They think the variable K is a good thing, as those individuals who spread it loads should be easy to track and trace, but the majority of people don't spread it much and it doesn't matter as much if you find them or not
05/06/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: Compulsory face masks incoming as well
05/06/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: Surely this was so obvious
05/06/2020, 20:36 - Paul;: Like a tissue when sneezing
05/06/2020, 20:37 - Paul;: They must be aware of that
05/06/2020, 20:37 - Paul;: “The science is inconclusive”
05/06/2020, 20:37 - Rob;: Yes. Objections to it are that masks aren't very effective at stopping you get a disease, but do help a lot in stopping you spread it. In a disease like this with an infectious period before the onset of symptoms, it makes perfect sense to ask everyone to wear masks
05/06/2020, 20:38 - Paul;: I shart in open and it sprays. I shart confined it no spray
05/06/2020, 20:38 - Rob;: It doesn't make sense for every disease, but seems to for this one
05/06/2020, 20:38 - Paul;: And other examples
05/06/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: The cold and flu. Coughs and sneezes spread diseases. This relative of that. Nah couldn’t possibly be the same
05/06/2020, 20:40 - Paul;: It’s beyond obvious surely
05/06/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: That bbc guy who tests positive after his difficult pneumonia. Very surprised I tested positive
05/06/2020, 20:41 - Phill: How’s the disease spread. Coughing. Cover gob. No particles.
05/06/2020, 20:41 - Rob;: There would be no point if you were only infectious when you had symptoms and everyone who had symptoms isolated
05/06/2020, 20:41 - Damian Rumble: Death
05/06/2020, 20:41 - Paul;: Cover gob. Done
05/06/2020, 20:42 - Phill: Ebola. Cover gob. Cover arse. Covid. Cover gob. HIV, cover dick.
05/06/2020, 20:42 - Paul;: That bbc guy - mental he wouldn’t connect the two together
05/06/2020, 20:42 - Phill: The answer is in front of us
05/06/2020, 20:43 - Paul;: >surprised after pneumonia when he never gets ill
05/06/2020, 20:43 - Rob;: A mask won't stop the 5G
05/06/2020, 20:45 - Damian Rumble: Need more K Stefan. Need moah!
05/06/2020, 20:45 - Paul;: @447752458076  is tonight k night?
05/06/2020, 20:47 - Stefan;: Could well be. We ran out so just bought 6 more grams
05/06/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: Which film
05/06/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: Nausica
05/06/2020, 20:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Feast
05/06/2020, 20:47 - Phill: How’s the bladder?
05/06/2020, 20:47 - Paul;: Or porco rosso
05/06/2020, 20:49 - Stefan;: Maybe nausica or kiki's delivery service. Porco Rosso too much fascism for a K trip
05/06/2020, 20:49 - Damian Rumble: Still not a huge fan of K. Maybe we should crack out some Studio Ghibli in Wales because clearly I am doing it wrong
05/06/2020, 20:49 - Stefan;: Functioning
05/06/2020, 20:50 - Phill: For now.....
05/06/2020, 20:51 - Sam;: Do you feel in charge?
05/06/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: Hear hear. Hit the depths of K the other month but takes ages to get out of it
05/06/2020, 20:52 - Paul;: Pretty sure I was in the K hole
05/06/2020, 20:52 - Rob;: I don't think I've ever gone deep enough with it
05/06/2020, 20:53 - Rob;: The drip and the initial buzz all I get
05/06/2020, 20:53 - Stefan;: Yeah I overdid the K watching Howl's Moving Castle the other week. Couldn't move or speak for a while
05/06/2020, 20:53 - Paul;: Starting coming round after being recruited by a group of people to head into a space ship. Like coming round from a dream
05/06/2020, 20:53 - Paul;: Was out for 40mins
05/06/2020, 20:53 - Paul;: Only remember 5 mins
05/06/2020, 20:53 - Stefan;: Lol that's deep
05/06/2020, 20:54 - Stefan;: When I eventually got up I was Stefan's moving castle
05/06/2020, 20:54 - David;: Lol yeah not hearing a lot about the 4 phases these days. Maybe they were just a phase? Hiiiiiiib
05/06/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: I believe I was in the k hole
05/06/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: I was due to travel into a different dimension
05/06/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: Full visuals
05/06/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: Then slowly come round back to reality
05/06/2020, 20:55 - Sam;: Had a ticket
05/06/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: It’s so annoying to process
05/06/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: I was being strapped into the pilot seat of the spaceship
05/06/2020, 20:56 - Sam;: Forced to pilot
05/06/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: Your honour. It wasn’t my idea
05/06/2020, 20:57 - Sam;: No trousers but asked to pilot
05/06/2020, 20:57 - Rob;: Most acutely fucked I've ever been was probably from a bong hit of salvia. Everything went extremely Gorillaz videos/windwaker and I couldn't move for 20 mins. Xfactor on TV. Unbearable.
05/06/2020, 20:58 - Paul;: The k hole isn’t bad it just takes a while. I did 2 big lines of CK and it really hit me
05/06/2020, 20:58 - David;: Lol this
05/06/2020, 20:59 - Sam;: This message was deleted
05/06/2020, 20:59 - Rob;: Favourite high ever is that daytime 2cb in Wales, when Phil could throw anything for miles
05/06/2020, 20:59 - Paul;: Coke ket mix
05/06/2020, 21:00 - David;: Yeah I've never hit the depths. Can you elaborate. At what point do you break through into a new reality?
05/06/2020, 21:00 - Paul;: Keep reading
05/06/2020, 21:00 - Damian Rumble: Being trapped in the aquarium...
05/06/2020, 21:01 - Damian Rumble: Can't forget the classic "Ball, Ball" can we?
05/06/2020, 21:01 - Damian Rumble: though it might have been more funny trying to explain this to James in the chequers given he wasn't even there at the time
05/06/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: The depth of k I was in was very matrix like. That I’d discovered a secret group who were preparing me to pilot a space craft to break through
05/06/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: The night if that obscene stew and dumplings with toad in the hole that was breathing
05/06/2020, 21:02 - David;: You need to go back and actually make the journey
05/06/2020, 21:02 - David;: You were only strapped in
05/06/2020, 21:02 - Damian Rumble: Phill just cooked up too enormous meals but we were too high to eat by that point
05/06/2020, 21:02 - Paul;: That’s when I started coming round
05/06/2020, 21:03 - Paul;: But I was gone for about 40mins. Motionless on the sofa
05/06/2020, 21:03 - David;: But you never actually made the journey. All prep
05/06/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: Probably had basic training I couldn’t remember
05/06/2020, 21:04 - David;: Like Neil Armstrong but he actually got out of Apollo 11 just before it took off
05/06/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: >basic training
05/06/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: I can’t deal with that
05/06/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: Boot camp
05/06/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: You wouldn’t put them straight in the craft
05/06/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: Next time I’ll be ready though
05/06/2020, 21:05 - Paul;: Skip that part
05/06/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: The depths of CK was purely due diligence
05/06/2020, 21:05 - David;: So it was mainly a health and safety operation
05/06/2020, 21:05 - Paul;: I didn’t know what to expect so got given 2 huge lines of CK
05/06/2020, 21:05 - David;: That can't be the limits of the k hole
05/06/2020, 21:06 - David;: Ah, what. This doesn't follow
05/06/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: Eh?
05/06/2020, 21:07 - Phill: “Derk, what’s Paul doing?”
05/06/2020, 21:07 - Phill: Derek*
05/06/2020, 21:07 - Rob;: Christine gave him the CK
05/06/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Derk & Chrastn - what’s our Pol dowen
05/06/2020, 21:08 - Sam;: Lol. Derek was also fucked. Obvs
05/06/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Louis CK
05/06/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Are you broken?
05/06/2020, 21:08 - Sam;: Pol
05/06/2020, 21:08 - Sam;: Pol ducknsun
05/06/2020, 21:09 - Phill: Derk pol on K agen
05/06/2020, 21:09 - Paul;: Never flown the k hole I see
05/06/2020, 21:09 - Phill: <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 21:09 - Paul;: Didn’t even pass basic training
05/06/2020, 21:10 - Paul;: @447969894197
05/06/2020, 21:12 - Sam;: Please don’t watch starship troopers rob
05/06/2020, 21:12 - Sam;: So many flash backs of not passing basic training
05/06/2020, 21:15 - / James Ball: Ah. Just read this whole conversation
05/06/2020, 21:15 - / James Ball: 123 messages
05/06/2020, 21:15 - / James Ball: Lel
05/06/2020, 21:16 - Paul;: Far too convenient
05/06/2020, 21:16 - Sam;: A convenient truth
05/06/2020, 21:19 - / James Ball: Ahts wart de fone say, Pol
05/06/2020, 21:20 - Sam;: Northern James not Jamaican
05/06/2020, 21:21 - Stefan;: Ah yeah, that really was the mad hatter's tea party. But with stew and dumplings
05/06/2020, 21:21 - Hamish Sinclair: Biggest yorkshire pudding
05/06/2020, 21:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Sam's curry, cant remember when that was
05/06/2020, 21:22 - Hamish Sinclair: Had to take triple the drugs, cos you know, he ate a curry
05/06/2020, 21:22 - Stefan;: Phil spent hours lovingly cooking a feast while we got completely muntered
05/06/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: That was always so foolproof as well...
05/06/2020, 21:22 - Sam;: Too big a curry
05/06/2020, 21:23 - Sam;: Drugs couldn’t get near it
05/06/2020, 21:23 - Paul;: The walls melted near it
05/06/2020, 21:24 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 21:24 - / James Ball: What's your Northern version?
05/06/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: Dave's grin
05/06/2020, 21:24 - Paul;: This is the peak?
05/06/2020, 21:25 - Sam;: Everyone so fucked
05/06/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: Have we got me at him at the window from this night?
05/06/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: Lol Stefan
05/06/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: May murder at any moment
05/06/2020, 21:25 - Paul;: Hellraiser
05/06/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: Stefan kills souls from 10ft away
05/06/2020, 21:26 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 21:27 - Rob;: Chinny mugs
05/06/2020, 21:27 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 21:27 - Rob;: 'we choose to do this'
05/06/2020, 21:29 - Phill: MOAR
05/06/2020, 21:30 - / James Ball: The Thornton sweat
05/06/2020, 21:31 - Stefan;: I remember just being transfixed by the chinny mugs at the window
05/06/2020, 21:31 - Phill: Best thing about this photo is that it’s clearly day time outside
05/06/2020, 21:31 - Sam;: We choose to go the moon in this decade
05/06/2020, 21:32 - Rob;: We thought we were so far away from the kitchen
05/06/2020, 21:33 - Stefan;: Not because it is easy, but because it is hard
05/06/2020, 21:33 - / James Ball: Actually, quite close
05/06/2020, 21:34 - Sam;: We choose to do the other thing
05/06/2020, 21:34 - Sam;: What’s the album? Public Service Announcement?
05/06/2020, 21:35 - Stefan;: Race for Space
05/06/2020, 21:35 - Rob;: Public Service Broadcasting
05/06/2020, 21:35 - Phill: <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 21:35 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
05/06/2020, 21:36 - Sam;: There it is
05/06/2020, 21:36 - Sam;: That’s joint
05/06/2020, 21:36 - Hamish Sinclair: Never been so lean
05/06/2020, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: Ahh... The join that destroyed me... Had to go and lie down in the bunk bed for an hour after that
05/06/2020, 21:38 - Damian Rumble: Joint*
05/06/2020, 22:22 - Paul;: Wu Wear
05/06/2020, 22:35 - Phill: Man actually really gutted don’t get to watch England this summer
05/06/2020, 22:36 - Phill: Sancho. Sterling. Kane. Henderson. Trent.
05/06/2020, 22:37 - Phill: Rashford.
05/06/2020, 23:15 - David;: Haha, remember this moment.
05/06/2020, 23:16 - David;: It couldnt have happened to a nicer guy
05/06/2020, 23:17 - David;: Public Service Announcement. The tribute act.
05/06/2020, 23:18 - David;: Wu wears wu wear on the sea shore
05/06/2020, 23:19 - David;: <Media omitted>
06/06/2020, 05:21 - Paul;: Time for some princess monoWOKEoe
06/06/2020, 06:54 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
06/06/2020, 06:56 - Phill: What are you doing up at 05:21 on a Saturday during locky?
06/06/2020, 07:55 - / James Ball: Clearly he was just woke AF
06/06/2020, 07:55 - / James Ball: So woke
06/06/2020, 08:41 - Rob;: This means kitless as in no weights, not no clothes, Ball Ball
06/06/2020, 08:42 - Phill: Yeet lel jomes u ghey
06/06/2020, 08:50 - Damian Rumble: Doople konig
06/06/2020, 09:06 - Paul;: Sniffing chop
06/06/2020, 09:12 - Rob;: BT and Sky will give you options to turn crowd noise on or off for the premier league
06/06/2020, 09:12 - Phill: Lol that will be so shit
06/06/2020, 09:13 - Phill: How are they going to predict the flow of the game? Sudden chances? How will the noise react to this?
06/06/2020, 09:13 - Phill: Or will it just be a droning crowd hum
06/06/2020, 09:13 - Phill: Constantly
06/06/2020, 09:14 - Rob;: Apparently they've been doing it for the Bundesliga and people haven't hated it surprisingly
06/06/2020, 09:14 - Phill: I want to hear klopp yelling
06/06/2020, 09:14 - Rob;: I would imagine it's the phrase 'and they're going at it, hammer and tongs' continuously
06/06/2020, 09:16 - Rob;: Schedule for the next 31 matches https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/premier-league-fixture-list-season-dates-kick-off-times-latest-a9546486.html
06/06/2020, 09:27 - Phill: When is fantasy football open again for transfers etc?
06/06/2020, 09:28 - Hamish Sinclair: I heard that apparently thetve been running the game Weeks
06/06/2020, 09:28 - Hamish Sinclair: So in theory you could have just retransferreyourteam during lockdown
06/06/2020, 09:30 - Rob;: Ah fuck that
06/06/2020, 09:30 - Rob;: Transfers is currently not an option on the app
06/06/2020, 09:31 - Phill: Yeah not an option for me
06/06/2020, 09:31 - Phill: Can’t do shit
06/06/2020, 09:32 - Phill: Can’t even see game week fixtures
06/06/2020, 09:33 - Rob;: Villa and arsenal double gameweek to begin
06/06/2020, 09:33 - Rob;: Man city too?
06/06/2020, 09:46 - Damian Rumble: Will post form be a thing? Who are the new bandwagons? Will peadopool continue to choke? so many questions..  IT ALREADY IS INTERESTING!
06/06/2020, 10:00 - Hamish Sinclair: There will be loads of weird results. Some of the safe teams may use it as preparation for next season
06/06/2020, 10:01 - Rob;: Can't wait to see who's got woefully unfit
06/06/2020, 10:23 - Phill: All those players that are known to be “good in training” are going to thrive
06/06/2020, 11:58 - / James Ball: But the implied homoeroticism
06/06/2020, 11:58 - Stefan;: Yeah strong repressed gay vibes from Lacey
06/06/2020, 11:59 - Paul;: Lacey obviously touching tips
06/06/2020, 12:04 - / James Ball: Kitless in the studio and kitless in the changing room. Very convenient
06/06/2020, 12:04 - / James Ball: Very easy to get confused in that situation
06/06/2020, 12:11 - Paul;: Laceys Facebook posts / comments are of a 50 yr old man who lives alone but made friends with the neighbours and discusses the TA at any opportunity and the history of the RAF. Invited over for a bbq gives off an odd vibe but seems harmless. He’s the one with a soundproof cellar
06/06/2020, 12:13 - Paul;: He also wears his mother’s skin
06/06/2020, 12:13 - / James Ball: I think he's more unlucky than that. He's the one everyone thinks has a soundproof cellar but actually he's just super awkward and goes to kitless workouts with his nob out
06/06/2020, 12:14 - / James Ball: Or had planning permission declined when he was going to build the soundproof cellar
06/06/2020, 12:16 - Paul;: Why was the planning permission declined?
06/06/2020, 12:18 - / James Ball: Didn't leave enough space for a fire escape. It's always the fire regs that get you
06/06/2020, 12:18 - Damian Rumble: Sound proof cellar full of model trains?
06/06/2020, 12:18 - Damian Rumble: And air fix kits
06/06/2020, 12:18 - Paul;: Mark Gacey. Crawl space absolutely packed
06/06/2020, 12:19 - / James Ball: His antique collection of vintage phallic idols
06/06/2020, 12:19 - / James Ball: "I just like the way the look"
06/06/2020, 12:32 - Rob;: Say what you like about the Nazis, but their tanks were second to none
06/06/2020, 12:32 - Rob;: And the uniforms fitted very well. You can see why Hugo Boss are where they are today
06/06/2020, 12:39 - David;: Lol this is what I live for. The droning monotone. Like that radio in Wales.
06/06/2020, 12:40 - David;: Painful to listen to, throbbing waves of noise. Forget what that game even was. But it was vital
06/06/2020, 12:40 - Rob;: Mark Lacey is all the male characters in American Beauty combined
06/06/2020, 12:42 - Paul;: And the plastic bag
06/06/2020, 12:43 - David;: Most like of our yeargroup to commit mass murder?
06/06/2020, 12:44 - Paul;: Harley bunce
06/06/2020, 12:44 - Rob;: Stephen Thresher
06/06/2020, 12:45 - David;: I'd say it is lacey. At one of the Christian glider events.

06/06/2020, 15:21 - Sam;: Takes the edge off
06/06/2020, 15:22 - Sam;: Not just hearing shouting
06/06/2020, 15:45 - / James Ball: If it works in FIFA it would work in the real world
06/06/2020, 16:11 - Damian Rumble: Watching some Peep show. The one where Jeff sends Mark out to get condom's before he could bang Sophie. Can't get close to that
06/06/2020, 16:18 - David;: But the consistent drone? Is there any reaction to on field events?
06/06/2020, 16:19 - David;: It would wierd me out there being some huge open goal chance or a  red card appeal and there's no reaction
06/06/2020, 16:50 - Phill: This
06/06/2020, 16:51 - Phill: At least with no synthetic crowd, you can hear the managers melting down
06/06/2020, 17:01 - Rob;: You'll have both options, and I'm sure they'll mix reactively
06/06/2020, 17:44 - Damian Rumble: This fucking June weather - @447752458076

06/06/2020, 18:54 - David;: What fucks me off is now the tories will be able to blame the second wave on the demonstrations not the fact everyone decided to pie off the lock down over Cummings.
06/06/2020, 18:54 - Rob;: And they definitely will. It's perfect for them.
06/06/2020, 18:55 - David;: Yeah timing plays into their hands. Ready made excuse
06/06/2020, 18:55 - David;: I hope there's some way of precisely dating it to last week not this week
06/06/2020, 18:55 - Rob;: All of them not Tory voters. Ideal scapegoats
06/06/2020, 18:55 - David;: But the data probably won't be that precise with the lags etc.

06/06/2020, 20:54 - / James Ball: Pepper sauce yeah
06/06/2020, 20:55 - / James Ball: Smells pretty good like flowers and pepper mixed together

07/06/2020, 12:45 - Hamish Sinclair: No frazzles? No rolo yogurt? Do you even froust?
07/06/2020, 12:45 - Phill: Although I feel that the rural liberal are not the same as the london liberal elite
07/06/2020, 12:45 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
07/06/2020, 12:46 - Phill: That whole box cost me £35. It’s all local and the shop is basically a barn.
07/06/2020, 12:46 - Phill: The liberal elite would spend £35 on half an avocado from the London branch of Daylesford
07/06/2020, 13:06 - Damian Rumble: The first step towards recovery is admitting you have problem
07/06/2020, 13:22 - Phill: Hamish, if they sold frazzled and roll yoghurt you know they’d be in my box. Come on.
07/06/2020, 13:22 - Phill: Although I’m partial to a snap over a frazzle
07/06/2020, 13:45 - Jack G;: Have you warmed up the pork pie yet Phil? Need a pic

07/06/2020, 14:44 - Paul;: He didn’t read his own book?
07/06/2020, 14:44 - David;: Nope. Ghost written for him by someone else and he had no idea what was even in it. Never read it
07/06/2020, 14:45 - David;: He said it was at a point in his life where he would say yes to anything on principle without questioning it
07/06/2020, 14:45 - Paul;: Had input on the title?
07/06/2020, 14:45 - David;: That was the basis on which he was operating.
07/06/2020, 14:46 - David;: Don't think so someone just approached him suggesting it and he okayed it. Didn't have input beyond that
07/06/2020, 14:47 - Paul;: Hah
07/06/2020, 14:47 - David;: He said he just wanted any publicity going.

07/06/2020, 16:04 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
07/06/2020, 16:17 - David;: Getting into the snooker on itv4. A sport that suffers absolutely nothing from corona. Can really grot down into it.
07/06/2020, 16:18 - David;: It's so low stakes in the first place. So no difference.
07/06/2020, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: Lol Everton. Sorry much money to consistently grind out 7th place
07/06/2020, 18:48 - Sam;: Anyone heard of the “10 cent beer night”. A night of mayhem at a baseball game in 1974
07/06/2020, 19:00 - Paul;: Yes, heard of that
07/06/2020, 19:07 - Sam;: Phew, good.
07/06/2020, 19:08 - David;: No
07/06/2020, 19:30 - Sam;: Quite predictable but funny that they couldn’t predict that ridiculously cheap beer would lead to drunken antics in the stadium

08/06/2020, 11:58 - Sam;: He’s forced to take that seriously. Does well to bounce it back to her.
08/06/2020, 12:44 - David;: <Media omitted>
08/06/2020, 12:50 - Rob;: Ah she told that one on Jonathan Ross once

08/06/2020, 16:52 - Rob;: Come on Mr Tinkerman tinker my bananas
08/06/2020, 16:52 - David;: And we're straight into a double gameweek?
08/06/2020, 16:53 - Rob;: For 4 teams
08/06/2020, 16:53 - Hamish Sinclair: NULL AND VOID
08/06/2020, 16:54 - David;: Well looking at my squad I believe it's perfect anyway. No holes.
08/06/2020, 16:54 - David;: Which 4?
08/06/2020, 16:57 - Rob;: Man City, Arsenal, Villa, Sheffield United
08/06/2020, 16:57 - David;: How's your pepe
08/06/2020, 16:58 - David;: Nah, that's a distraction. All set up to crowd Sheffield and villa players in and be left with a squad built of raw shit
08/06/2020, 16:58 - David;: Best to avoid
08/06/2020, 16:58 - Rob;: Barely anyone seems to be injured, which must be a lack of data
08/06/2020, 16:58 - David;: If no one is fit then everyone's fit
08/06/2020, 16:59 - Rob;: Leicester seem to have some injuries
08/06/2020, 16:59 - David;: Aubameyang could score a goal last time I checked.
08/06/2020, 17:00 - Rob;: He, Lacazatte and a young Nokia Nketiah bagged goals in a friendly against charlton
08/06/2020, 17:00 - Rob;: Nketiah quaffed three
08/06/2020, 17:01 - Damian Rumble: What a leveller
08/06/2020, 17:01 - David;: Will I no be buying Nketiah
08/06/2020, 17:01 - David;: Will he even start
08/06/2020, 17:02 - Rob;: We have two great strikers who are fit, so perhap nah
08/06/2020, 17:03 - David;: Is the fa cup ded then?
08/06/2020, 17:06 - David;: Ah just been plunged back into the eternal troll of the city defence. I haven't missed this
08/06/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: I don't think so
08/06/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: Yep it's on
08/06/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: Only 8 teams left, so not that disruptive, and now we can have football any day
08/06/2020, 17:08 - David;: Europe ded?
08/06/2020, 17:08 - Rob;: Yes
08/06/2020, 17:08 - David;: Ah good. Still the reigning champions then
08/06/2020, 17:09 - Rob;: They should behave a ceremony where they take it away from you and put it back in a cupboard until next year
08/06/2020, 17:09 - David;: If we win it next year would that count as defending our title? I'm going to go about my life on the assumption it would
08/06/2020, 17:10 - Rob;: You did get knocked out
08/06/2020, 17:10 - David;: Of a tourny declared void. Next
08/06/2020, 17:10 - Phill: They should lend it to Arsenal for the year so they can pretend to be relevant.
08/06/2020, 17:12 - Rob;: Looking at the table again was very chastening
08/06/2020, 17:13 - Rob;: > Being in a position where voiding would make no difference
08/06/2020, 17:13 - David;: Ah yeah there you are. I'd forgotten you were a piece of shit
08/06/2020, 17:13 - David;: Somehow thought you were in the race for 4th
08/06/2020, 17:14 - Sam;: Europe not ded yet
08/06/2020, 17:14 - David;: Spurs also equally wank though. You can hold onto that
08/06/2020, 17:14 - Phill: <Media omitted>
08/06/2020, 17:14 - Sam;: UEFA to meet on 17th of June
08/06/2020, 17:15 - David;: Who's even the managers now
08/06/2020, 17:15 - David;: I've forgotten football
08/06/2020, 17:15 - Rob;: Big. I thought they wiped it
08/06/2020, 17:15 - Rob;: How will the French teams deal with it?
08/06/2020, 17:16 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
08/06/2020, 17:16 - David;: Yeah having to play knock out European ties with no domestic foot ally going on
08/06/2020, 17:16 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
08/06/2020, 17:17 - David;: BREAKING
08/06/2020, 17:17 - Sam;: Announced today as it happens
08/06/2020, 17:20 - Rob;: So only League 1 of the big leagues called it all off?
08/06/2020, 17:20 - Rob;: Slight self troll
08/06/2020, 17:26 - Jack G;: Wasn’t the Dutch league cancelled as well?
08/06/2020, 17:30 - Rob;: Seems so
08/06/2020, 17:30 - Rob;: Oh well
08/06/2020, 17:31 - Rob;: Just Lyon and PSG in the champs league still with no domestic schedule
08/06/2020, 18:28 - Phill: Anyone watched this Norwegian drama on BBC called Twin?
08/06/2020, 18:38 - Sam;: Man City’s case at the CAS then
08/06/2020, 18:38 - Sam;: Live at the CAS
08/06/2020, 19:38 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
08/06/2020, 19:39 - Sam;: Thoughts on the above?
08/06/2020, 20:02 - Rob;: Makes sense if that's when this season finishes
08/06/2020, 20:10 - Sam;: Would have to drop one or both cups to achievement a normal May finish next year surely?
08/06/2020, 20:11 - Rob;: Yeah, if euros are to start at their usual time
08/06/2020, 20:12 - Rob;: League cup on its own gets you what, two rounds of midweek fixtures for everyone?
08/06/2020, 20:17 - Sam;: 5 potentially if we’re saying that there would a prem round in each of the league cup midweek slots. R3, R4, QF, SF leg 1 and Leg 2. 

Then without the final there wouldn’t be the postponed prem game to catch up either.
08/06/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: Yeah, does pack it in a lot for the prem teams though. Some then eventually most of them would normally get a rest from R4 to SF
08/06/2020, 20:20 - Rob;: Losing the FA cup would give you more, but it would be more of a shame to lose
08/06/2020, 20:25 - Sam;: How many games would need to be made up by loosing August and September?
08/06/2020, 20:26 - Sam;: 7 played in those months this season.
08/06/2020, 20:27 - Sam;: If we lost both cups it would be pretty easy to do
08/06/2020, 20:27 - Phill: Who even cares?
08/06/2020, 20:27 - Phill: Just play the games and love the players around
08/06/2020, 20:27 - Rob;: When will this season finish? Do they need to wait until October given that they've just had 3 months off?
08/06/2020, 20:27 - Phill: Move the players*
08/06/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: Just love them
08/06/2020, 20:28 - Sam;: Lol
08/06/2020, 20:28 - Phill: Ball in net. Pass ball. Pay money. Buy legs.
08/06/2020, 20:29 - Sam;: At present this season will be finished by the end of July. Fa cup final on August 1
08/06/2020, 20:29 - Sam;: But Europe TBC.
08/06/2020, 20:30 - Phill: Fan shout. Win. Lose. 3 points. No points. Champions. Whistle blow. Card out. VAR on. VAR off. Post. Crossbar. Celebrate. Commiserate.
08/06/2020, 21:29 - Damian Rumble: Coming soon to a crappy t-shirt and dodgy tattoo artist near you
08/06/2020, 22:06 - David;: Can surely shrink pre-seqson next summer by a couple of weeks as well to smooth it out and take pressure off this season
08/06/2020, 22:21 - David;: https://twitter.com/martin_oneill/status/1270076406857445380
08/06/2020, 22:30 - Hamish Sinclair: This is so upsetting

09/06/2020, 10:57 - David;: <Media omitted>
09/06/2020, 10:58 - David;: Excess deaths close to normal again now
09/06/2020, 10:58 - David;: Plus non-covid deaths are now below average
09/06/2020, 13:02 - Phill: Lol Damo you’ve gone full right wing there pal
09/06/2020, 13:14 - Rob;: The slave labour thing?
09/06/2020, 13:14 - Rob;: Straight out of age 14 Ukip Damo
09/06/2020, 13:14 - Phill: Ye
09/06/2020, 13:15 - Damian Rumble: Wasn't aware that objecting to the vandalism of historical monuments was what passed for being right wing these days
09/06/2020, 13:16 - Paul;: BNP Damo
09/06/2020, 13:16 - Phill: I but dismissing racism as a modern sensibility is very Daily Mail
09/06/2020, 13:17 - Paul;: Damian the defender of slavery
09/06/2020, 13:18 - Rob;: It's the unwise equivalence you drew between something made by slaves and a statue celebrating someone who profited from selling slaves that's the right wing thing
09/06/2020, 13:21 - Damian Rumble: That's not the equivalence I am making
09/06/2020, 13:21 - Phill: <Media omitted>
09/06/2020, 13:25 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
09/06/2020, 13:25 - Paul;: Lol anger at slavery “a modern sensibility”
09/06/2020, 13:26 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
09/06/2020, 13:28 - Rob;: Also, a new right wing trope: statues in town centres are some essential part of history education.
09/06/2020, 13:29 - Phill: Lol he’s also compared BAME protestors to ISIS
09/06/2020, 13:29 - Rob;: We all remember those history lessons, staring endlessly at the Chippy War memorial. It was the only way to learn about the war, since there were no books about it
09/06/2020, 13:29 - Phill: LOL
09/06/2020, 13:32 - Rob;: I often go to Trafalgar Square so I can look up learn about Lord Nelson
09/06/2020, 13:35 - Sam;: Where’s our hitler statue?
09/06/2020, 13:35 - Sam;: I demand hitler!

09/06/2020, 13:38 - Phill: Your PR consultant really did need a review of it before it was published.
09/06/2020, 13:39 - Rob;: Yeah, I do agree that it should have been put in a museum when people first campaigned for it to be removed, but those first two paragraphs....

10/06/2020, 12:16 - Sam;: Enjoying Sir Kier in PMQ’s. Big upgrade in corbyn. Boris really seeming arrogant and incompetent. Such basic debate tactics - his defence is always, “you seems confused on his point”
10/06/2020, 12:16 - Sam;: Rehearsed attack lines
10/06/2020, 12:21 - Damian Rumble: Yep. Refreshing to finally have a competent leader of the  opposition. Can definitely see myself potentially voting for a Starmer government

10/06/2020, 13:04 - Rob;: And it's become a meme format that people write to
10/06/2020, 13:04 - / James Ball: there's a guy that produces them, no?
10/06/2020, 13:04 - / James Ball: he does have an AI software that makes them
10/06/2020, 13:04 - / James Ball: Harry Potter etc
10/06/2020, 13:05 - Rob;: He's programmed it beautifully then
10/06/2020, 13:06 - / James Ball: yeah, you just make a program that writes words and "reward" it when it writes words that match some given input so it writes more words that match the input. you do it enough and it makes things like this
10/06/2020, 13:07 - / James Ball: I guess things like "Ronald Rogaine" come from it using a dictionary to remove nonsense words and Reagan was not in the dictionary

11/06/2020, 18:50 - David;: Yeah just naming the Asian cabinet members as proof they must be an inclusive government
11/06/2020, 18:58 - David;: La liga then

11/06/2020, 20:11 - / James Ball: I'm growing some habbys now. Few little habby
11/06/2020, 20:45 - Paul;: Thoughts on all the tv programmes being removed from bbc etc?
11/06/2020, 20:48 - / James Ball: erasure of history on either side is not a solution and only causes further division
11/06/2020, 20:50 - Sam;: So should we start showing ‘Love thy Neighbour’ then? Where they use phrases like ‘nig-nog’.
11/06/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: This is besides the point, but is Papa Lazarou the only blackface in League of Gentlemen? Because he is an absolutely insane creation I can't get a handle on and not really on the same plane of existence as anything else
11/06/2020, 20:52 - Sam;: It’s still very reminiscent of the black and white minstrels
11/06/2020, 20:52 - Sam;: Which was very racist
11/06/2020, 20:52 - / James Ball: Probably not, but following that should we ban its sale then?
11/06/2020, 20:52 - / James Ball: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Love-Thy-Neighbour-Complete-DVD/dp/B01CA3XDGW/
11/06/2020, 20:53 - Rob;: Yeah, I suppose it is. It's a weird one, because he's an insane Greek wife snatcher who can hide inside old women
11/06/2020, 20:54 - Sam;: Yes
11/06/2020, 20:54 - / James Ball: So we should censor it because it says bad things.
11/06/2020, 20:54 - / James Ball: So it should also be illegal to sell Mein Kampf then?
11/06/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: Should censor history books
11/06/2020, 20:55 - Sam;: No one is talking about making illegal
11/06/2020, 20:55 - / James Ball: Banning sale = illegal to sell
11/06/2020, 20:55 - Sam;: Just stop doing it, to move on from it
11/06/2020, 20:56 - Sam;: Amazon should ban it I mean
11/06/2020, 20:56 - Sam;: They do that with many products
11/06/2020, 20:56 - / James Ball: Borat?
11/06/2020, 20:57 - Sam;: I’m not the council of DVD sales.
11/06/2020, 20:57 - Rob;: I think not showing blackface anymore is a proportionate and considerate thing for a broadcaster to do. TV on demand is a grey area because it's less the broadcaster deciding to show it to you, and more each users' choice. I don't particularly feel comfortable with either outcome there
11/06/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: No, I'm just pointing out that it's absurd and where to we draw the line of restriction
11/06/2020, 20:58 - / James Ball: Agreed
11/06/2020, 21:00 - Sam;: Racist things. Those are things people want to be removed.
11/06/2020, 21:01 - Rob;: It is a bit mad that they went ahead with blacking  up in Little Britain and Come fly with me and it caused very little controversy at the time
11/06/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Love thy neighbour wasn’t at the time..
11/06/2020, 21:03 - Rob;: I've never even heard of Love thy neighbour
11/06/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: It’s basically the classic example of overt 70’s racism to immigrants
11/06/2020, 21:04 - Rob;: Summer Heights High is going too. Could just refit to just the J'amie and Mr G scenes
11/06/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: One of many.
11/06/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: I can understand that being accepted more then than the stuff that came out like 10-15 years ago
11/06/2020, 21:07 - Sam;: I guess it’s down to the people green lighting shows 20 years ago growing up in the 70s or even 60s
11/06/2020, 21:08 - David;: We censor it ourselves by not watching or endorsing it. Engage your own critical faculties.
11/06/2020, 21:11 - / James Ball: Yes when the censorship is enforced by a 3rd party it necessarily creates division and only meets the requirements of a minority of people
11/06/2020, 21:11 - / James Ball: Any form of higher censorship will never actually have a wholly positive effect
11/06/2020, 21:18 - Sam;: It’s not about us though. It’s about minorities who have to just “take it on the chin” when these things crop up in entertainment. Removing it is a show of respect and acknowledgment of the fact that we’ve never had to experience casual racism like that. It’s not censorship at all it’s de-platforming. That sort of stuff can still get made it’s just not going to promoted or perpetuated by tax payer funded outlets like the BBC.
11/06/2020, 21:24 - / James Ball: Only thing removed from iPlayer is little Britain so far I think?
11/06/2020, 21:27 - / James Ball: I agree with that the essence of that too but the fact remains where do you stop
11/06/2020, 21:27 - / James Ball: Do you also remove anything that features negative stereotypes of white people
11/06/2020, 21:30 - / James Ball: If you start removing things in big swathes like this rather than assessing things on their merits (or lack thereof) it doesn't solve anything and may even stir up more racial tension in the short term
11/06/2020, 21:32 - Sam;: That sort of thinking is why Coulsons statue was still standing.
11/06/2020, 21:35 - Sam;: It’s a good start as far as minorities are concerned
11/06/2020, 21:36 - / James Ball: So what's the final point if this is the start? Never mentioning anything about another group unless you are within that group?
11/06/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: To be fair, I think the only things that have been removed are those with blackface, so there is potential for that to be the line and it stops there
11/06/2020, 21:37 - Rob;: I could well be wrong
11/06/2020, 21:38 - / James Ball: To take the mighty boosh as an example then, why remove a whole series when one character in one episode is blackface. Is that responding to a racist character or just knee jerk?
11/06/2020, 21:39 - Sam;: There’s no perfect end point. It’s and ongoing thing that requires dialogue. The “where does is end argument” is now in the same category as “it’s PC gone mad”
11/06/2020, 21:41 - / James Ball: No it really isn't. I'm not pro blackface. Where does it end is a valid question when we as a society are deciding which parts we want to remove going forward
11/06/2020, 21:42 - Phill: Question: Is it racist to not care about all of this and just carry on living my life as a non-racist?
11/06/2020, 21:43 - / James Ball: Some films have sex/drugs/violence in which are individually offensive to various people but for that a warning suffices
11/06/2020, 21:43 - Phill: Or am I racist because by not wanting to engage I am saying it’s OK?
11/06/2020, 21:45 - Phill: I’m just knackered after brexit and Covid I need a rest from difficult socio-economic issues.
11/06/2020, 21:46 - Sam;: It’s not racist phil. It’s an example of white privilege that we can opt-out of the conversation as carry on as normal. White privilege doesn’t = racism btw. It’s being to do something or choose not to, which minorities don’t get a choice to aka a privilege
11/06/2020, 21:46 - Sam;: It’s not just about beating white people over the head for all problems
11/06/2020, 21:47 - / James Ball: So choosing to ignore racist things and letting them fade into the past, whilst maintaining education about them, is bad?
11/06/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: I don't think you specifically have to care about old TV programmes, but part of being anti-racist is educating yourself on the systems and other things in society that enable and continue racism. Being silent about those things helps them continue. But yeah, it's hard to have enough headspace for all the problems. You can only try to be as open as your can to different viewpoints.
11/06/2020, 21:48 - Sam;: Whose saying to do that? Education is good. Sitcoms on the BBC are not education..
11/06/2020, 21:48 - / James Ball: Sorry, I wasn't comparing sitcoms to eduaction
11/06/2020, 21:48 - / James Ball: I was picking up on Phil's point
11/06/2020, 21:48 - Rob;: TV is more a product of the system than a direct cause obviously
11/06/2020, 21:49 - Sam;: Ah ok
11/06/2020, 21:50 - / James Ball: I meant that if societally if we chose to just ignore the racist things, whilst still remaining educated about them, is that not a suitable way of moving on?
11/06/2020, 21:51 - Sam;: Nah, we (collective we) got to challenge the bigots out there
11/06/2020, 21:51 - Sam;: >collective we
11/06/2020, 21:51 - Sam;: Joint piss
11/06/2020, 21:52 - Sam;: I’m also having to deal with Laura just pronouncing archive as arch-I’ve.
11/06/2020, 21:52 - Phill: But ignoring bigots is quite a good way of changing viewpoints
11/06/2020, 21:52 - Rob;: Lol WHAT
11/06/2020, 21:53 - Sam;: I think getting them out in the open is better.
11/06/2020, 21:53 - Sam;: Whose chives?
11/06/2020, 21:53 - / James Ball: As in, sounds like "our chive"?
11/06/2020, 21:54 - Sam;: Yeah yeah. But it was plural. Our chives.
11/06/2020, 21:54 - Sam;: Are chives
11/06/2020, 21:55 - / James Ball: They are chives over yonder
11/06/2020, 21:55 - / James Ball: Posh RP or rural Yorkshire?
11/06/2020, 21:55 - Rob;: True and can work for the really proactive wankers who feed off of attention like Farage, but this moment is more about directly addressing the harder-to-spot systems and prejudices that white society collectively ignores
11/06/2020, 21:57 - / James Ball: How do we combat the vast amounts of general low level racism day to day? The football racism for example. The kind of people that think it's ok to boo black players or whatever are going to take one look at this and then think "it's PC gone mad"
11/06/2020, 21:57 - / James Ball: Driving a wedge further and pushing viewpoints further apart.
11/06/2020, 21:58 - Rob;: I obviously don't have the  answer, but doing something is better than nothing
11/06/2020, 21:59 - / James Ball: Yeah I'm more asking generally
11/06/2020, 21:59 - / James Ball: And I agree
11/06/2020, 21:59 - / James Ball: I've actually done a whole heap of work around this subject
11/06/2020, 22:01 - / James Ball: The show I did in South Africa was all about white privilege and ignoring black plight but seen through the eyes of "it's ok as it's the way it's done and were not individually racist"
11/06/2020, 22:01 - Rob;: How you vote, what you read, whether you write to your MP, the petitions you sign, the initiatives you donate to, how you explain things to your older friends and family, the practices you suggest should be changed at work. Those are all achievable things you can do consistently to do something
11/06/2020, 22:02 - / James Ball: Why I'm no longer talking to white people about race by Renni Eddo-Lodge is a great dive into this whole subject
11/06/2020, 22:02 - Rob;: Yes
11/06/2020, 22:03 - Stefan;: Yeah it's great, and being widely read atm
11/06/2020, 22:04 - Stefan;: White Fragility is also good. Not particularly well written, but it gets you to interrogate your own reactions to confronting racism
11/06/2020, 22:06 - / James Ball: I'd not heard of that one I'll have a look
11/06/2020, 22:08 - / James Ball: I think, fortunately, it is something that is gradually dying out with the older generation. But one of the key things is standing up to and resisting racism when you see it. Much the same as you would any other crime
11/06/2020, 22:10 - / James Ball: I remember when I worked in HMV we had a little radio in the back room and I put it on 6 music. One of the older guys (a bit of a shit muncher) came up to me and said "oh thanks for changing the radio, I always avoided radio 6 before because I though it was black man's music"
11/06/2020, 22:12 - Stefan;: A lot of anti-racism work is also about learning to recognise the subtler ways it manifests, and the social structures that maintain it. You can only challenge it if you first see it.
11/06/2020, 22:13 - Rob;: I don't really think racism will just go by the time we're old. Certainly it'll be better and less overt, but those intrinsic things about society that give minorities less of a chance will be difficult to fix, because most people can go about their lives without realising they are there
11/06/2020, 22:15 - / James Ball: Yeah to clarify I think it's the general ignorant racism and overt hatred that is mostly held my the older generations. Obviously it's still being passed down though
11/06/2020, 22:15 - Stefan;: People can get complacent and sort of believe racism just naturally dissipates over time with passing generations. It takes active work, and gains made can always be undone.
11/06/2020, 22:16 - Rob;: Also, by the time we're old everyone young will hate us because we refuse to recognise the union between a transexual lamp and a abstract noun. Morals change.
11/06/2020, 22:16 - Rob;: Well I for one welcome that union!
11/06/2020, 22:17 - / James Ball: No I think it very much stays with time. But through education we can reduce it with each generation
11/06/2020, 22:17 - Stefan;: Ah yeah, I'm looking forward to finding out what views I currently have make me bigoted and backwards when I'm old
11/06/2020, 22:17 - / James Ball: We're better educated about it now than our parents were
11/06/2020, 22:18 - / James Ball: So we're passively more likely to not be racist
11/06/2020, 22:18 - / James Ball: We as a generation
11/06/2020, 22:18 - / James Ball: Collective we
11/06/2020, 22:20 - Rob;: But our children and grandchildrenmight describe is as less open educated about it than them. Buckle in for a wild ride.
11/06/2020, 22:21 - / James Ball: Yeah I assume they will and so our falsehoods die out with time. Thus reducing generation on generation?
11/06/2020, 22:22 - Rob;: Yeah
11/06/2020, 22:23 - Rob;: But we can help it reduce more quickly by working harder
11/06/2020, 22:25 - / James Ball: Well that's that wrapped up then
11/06/2020, 22:25 - / James Ball: Racism solved
11/06/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: Feels good

12/06/2020, 08:22 - Rob;: If you're a shady government body planning Corona virus 8 years in advance, why allocate your budget to advertising space in Times Square hinting at what you're doing?
12/06/2020, 08:40 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure how the comment has any relation to the image, as from the lofty assertion that some people were planning something
12/06/2020, 08:46 - / James Ball: Statistical low point but likely to return higher for May?
12/06/2020, 08:47 - Paul;: It’s only for one month as well. Doesn’t wipe out 18 years
12/06/2020, 09:03 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 09:04 - Rob;: Makes 2008 look 2000 and great
12/06/2020, 09:11 - / James Ball: But surely the important thing is the angle of the graph, ie the rate of change
12/06/2020, 09:12 - / James Ball: And it also fell because no one could do anything. It will rebound somewhat if people go back to work
12/06/2020, 09:12 - / James Ball: Did I read that the DOW is already back to pre covid levels?
12/06/2020, 09:14 - Rob;: Yeah, it will probably be the biggest rise ever seen, but not equal to the drop.
12/06/2020, 09:27 - / James Ball: Yeast shortage affecting marmite production I see
12/06/2020, 09:27 - / James Ball: Time to panic buy marmite
12/06/2020, 09:28 - David;: This. A lot of the lost demand can't be replaced - plus effects of bankruptcies and long term scarring and hysterisis effects on the labour force. Markets had recovered a lot of ground but not to pre-COVID levels, and the effects on individuals sectors and stocks within that have been very variable. Also, e.g. the DOW is down 7% today.
12/06/2020, 09:28 - Rob;: You didn't hear this from me, but Tesco anticipating peanut butter ice cream / lolly shortages in the next couple of months
12/06/2020, 09:29 - Paul;: Lol why is this such top secret news
12/06/2020, 09:29 - David;: So I need to hoard penut butter ice cream?
12/06/2020, 09:29 - Rob;: I could probably get fired if seen to be giving away information that would help a competitor
12/06/2020, 09:30 - David;: I mean I'd never usually even be buying it, but now I know there might be a shortage I will cram my freezer to the limit.
12/06/2020, 09:30 - Rob;: Yeah, get it all. You want the option if you do ever decide to eat it
12/06/2020, 09:31 - David;: Could I start a huge arbitrage scheme by buying it from Morrisons and selling to Tesco?
12/06/2020, 09:31 - David;: Through a large system of intermediary holding companies based in the cayman islands.
12/06/2020, 09:33 - / James Ball: Lol specifically peanut butter ice cream. Not peanut butter or plain ice cream, but the two together is in dire shortage
12/06/2020, 09:34 - Rob;: Sorry there should have been an and in the there
12/06/2020, 09:35 - Rob;: Peanut butter, and ice creams
12/06/2020, 09:36 - David;: Lol, fucking estate agents. So putting my flat on the market. Conells were offering ridiculous fees so told them I was going to use purplebricks instead. Look who comes knocking.
12/06/2020, 09:36 - David;: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 09:36 - David;: The panic. She's on the ropes.
12/06/2020, 09:37 - David;: So for reference the quoted fee is total bollocks and they take everyone for mugs. Interesting.
12/06/2020, 09:38 - / James Ball: Wed sell it really easily, promise!
12/06/2020, 09:38 - David;: Estate agents literally my least favourite category of people.
12/06/2020, 09:39 - / James Ball: The ultimate middlemen
12/06/2020, 09:39 - David;: They need disrupting out of existence
12/06/2020, 09:40 - David;: They were proposing a fee of 3,000 + VAT (so 3,600) to sell a 2 bed flat valued at 200,000.
12/06/2020, 09:40 - David;: So more than my monthly salary, and almost 2% of the property value.
12/06/2020, 09:41 - / James Ball: Cunts
12/06/2020, 09:41 - David;: That was obviously not including solicitors fees
12/06/2020, 09:41 - / James Ball: Everyone taking a cut
12/06/2020, 09:41 - David;: Purplebricks = 1 grand, including VAT.
12/06/2020, 09:42 - / James Ball: Also the work they do is often riddled with errors and poor
12/06/2020, 09:42 - David;: Yes, they are shit and incompetent as well.
12/06/2020, 09:42 - Sam;: Were those sort of fees not included in the recent legislation or was that just applied to rentals?
12/06/2020, 09:42 - / James Ball: The energy report on my current house lists almost all factors as (assumed, not checked)
12/06/2020, 09:43 - / James Ball: Isn't checking these things your literal job and the entire reason you were hired?
12/06/2020, 09:43 - / James Ball: Insufficient loft insulation (assumed, not checked)
12/06/2020, 09:44 - David;: Lol.
12/06/2020, 09:44 - David;: You'd want to know that
12/06/2020, 09:44 - David;: Large aging asbestos stockpile (assumed, not checked)
12/06/2020, 09:45 - Rob;: Is the plan to buy in Edinburgh?
12/06/2020, 09:45 - David;: Yeah, now we're there long term we're going to sell here to buy up there. Simplify
12/06/2020, 09:46 - Rob;: Think this was just renting. And from the experience of the people who took over my flat when I moved, they're still finding ways to be arseholes
12/06/2020, 09:46 - Rob;: Yeah yeah, time to shit where you eat (own where you earn)
12/06/2020, 09:46 - / James Ball: Or used to earn
12/06/2020, 09:46 - David;: Don't know about that legislation to be honest, but was that hidden fees? These weren't hidden they were just brazen over-priced fees.
12/06/2020, 09:47 - Rob;: The change to rentals was to pass contract renewal fees above £50, and reference fees onto landlords
12/06/2020, 09:47 - / James Ball: To be fair this year was my first move since the law changed and it was pretty painless. No fees at all, just deposit. They even took a lower offer on rental
12/06/2020, 09:48 - David;: Good time to be entering rental market I imagine low demand and landlords just wanting to get people in
12/06/2020, 09:48 - Rob;: In our flat the changes jncentivised the estate agents to not bother actually sending us a renewed contract and which slipped into a rolling month by month deal without our landlord knowing. Great for me when knowing I was going to buy
12/06/2020, 09:49 - Rob;: Apparently demand rocketed actually
12/06/2020, 09:49 - Rob;: Could be temporary as it's just pent up from lockdown
12/06/2020, 09:49 - Rob;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/amp/uk-england-52847319
12/06/2020, 09:50 - Rob;: That's the article with a man named DJ branch
12/06/2020, 09:50 - David;: I've heard the house market is surprisingly active as well, maybe for a similar reason.
12/06/2020, 09:50 - / James Ball: Yeah this is just a standard Assured Shorthold Tenancy apparently. An initial fixed term and then indefinite monthly rolling, usually with 2 month notice period
12/06/2020, 09:50 - / James Ball: It's what it was at my last place
12/06/2020, 09:51 - David;: Yep I've used that with tenants as a landlord on this place.
12/06/2020, 09:51 - Phill: People have become disgusted by their own homes having been locked up in them for months so want a change
12/06/2020, 09:51 - David;: Realised they live in a rotting sty.
12/06/2020, 09:51 - Phill: Also going to really push our garden when we sell in 12 months
12/06/2020, 09:51 - David;: 'oh look it's a piece of shit'
12/06/2020, 09:52 - David;: Yep I'm planning to plug the balcony hard in the advert. and proximity to massive park
12/06/2020, 09:53 - Rob;: The buyers on Julia's brother's house pulled out two weeks ago, saying the housing market was about to collapse and the didn't want to pay too much. He sold it the following weekend for 10k more
12/06/2020, 09:54 - Sam;: That guy... explain that one to the wife. I know it’s your dream home but..
12/06/2020, 09:59 - David;: Little word of advice to all. Don't ever shop at asda it's a piece of shit.
12/06/2020, 09:59 - Rob;: That one in Leamington is grotty as fuck
12/06/2020, 09:59 - Rob;: You want the huge Sainsbury's. Second biggest in the country
12/06/2020, 10:00 - David;: Yeah, just such an underwhelming experience after Lidl. Oh, double the price for shittier stuff? Great.
12/06/2020, 10:00 - David;: But I needed tahini Rob.
12/06/2020, 10:00 - Phill: Found this lovely little house
12/06/2020, 10:00 - Phill: https://www.rightmove.co.uk/new-homes-for-sale/fullscreen/image-gallery.html?propertyId=93151625&photoIndex=2
12/06/2020, 10:00 - David;: where's this? Don't think I've been.
12/06/2020, 10:01 - Phill: Wattle and daub. Drop toilet inside.
12/06/2020, 10:01 - Rob;: You want that
12/06/2020, 10:01 - Rob;: Get it
12/06/2020, 10:01 - David;: Probably just snaffle that.
12/06/2020, 10:02 - David;: Fan of the log burner
12/06/2020, 10:04 - Rob;: Tachbrook park drive, like southeast
12/06/2020, 10:04 - Rob;: Log burners are goat
12/06/2020, 10:04 - Rob;: Can't wait to get one
12/06/2020, 10:20 - / James Ball: Possibly soon banned though
12/06/2020, 10:20 - Rob;: Yeah, need to get in there
12/06/2020, 10:20 - Phill: Yeah get your burner in they ban that shit now.
12/06/2020, 10:21 - Rob;: They have been upping the eco requirements and most comply now
12/06/2020, 10:21 - / James Ball: Illegal to burn softwood too
12/06/2020, 10:21 - / James Ball: Only allowed to burn ancient oaks
12/06/2020, 10:22 - Rob;: Only sequoia
12/06/2020, 10:23 - / James Ball: Or just import Chinese hardwoods. Huge ecological impact but not here so that's ok
12/06/2020, 10:24 - Rob;: Excellent
12/06/2020, 10:26 - David;: Good luck enforcing that on ByC. Come at us.
12/06/2020, 10:27 - David;: Soft wood everywhere. They literally planted a forest full of it right next to the house and then didn't bother to harvest it.
12/06/2020, 10:27 - / James Ball: Less dense. Creates more soot.
12/06/2020, 10:28 - / James Ball: Best dispose of it all in big fire and then plant oak instead
12/06/2020, 10:29 - Rob;: I have read some studies of the particulate release from wood burners, and it is fucking shit
12/06/2020, 10:29 - Rob;: But fuck it. We're humans. We love fire
12/06/2020, 10:29 - Rob;: You can't take our fire
12/06/2020, 10:29 - David;: You can take fire
12/06/2020, 10:30 - David;: That's been tried and tested. A real human classic
12/06/2020, 10:30 - David;: Universally loved
12/06/2020, 10:30 - David;: I really don't think climate change can be placed at the door of the ByC wood burner. Maybe try the global fossil fuel industry first
12/06/2020, 10:31 - Rob;: It's more public health from breathing in particulates
12/06/2020, 10:31 - Rob;: BYC will never matter as no one walks past
12/06/2020, 10:31 - David;: Yeah from the dense slums of snowdonia
12/06/2020, 10:32 - Rob;: My terraced house on a busy road is definitely the house they don't want to have a woodburner
12/06/2020, 10:34 - David;: You can't take fire. They'll be taking away abstract thought and language next.
12/06/2020, 10:35 - David;: Opposable thumbs.
12/06/2020, 10:35 - Rob;: To burn is to be human
12/06/2020, 10:37 - David;: They haven't banned smoking yet. So you can still deliberately suck smoke and ash straight into your lungs but not burn wood for warmth.
12/06/2020, 10:38 - David;: I'm not happy with that
12/06/2020, 10:38 - Rob;: As a hipster, I get all my smoke second-hand
12/06/2020, 10:39 - / James Ball: It's more that they had the clean air act to remove smog which worked great. Then everyone started fitting wood burners to houses with perfectly good central heating and lowering the air quality but not even for the warmth. Just for looks. A fashionably low air quality
12/06/2020, 10:40 - David;: Different sort of warmth you get though. Not comparable
12/06/2020, 10:40 - Rob;: To be fair to me, which we all want, the room I'm putting it in is fucking cold even with the heating on
12/06/2020, 10:40 - David;: Try frousting in front of a radiator
12/06/2020, 10:40 - Rob;: Lol
12/06/2020, 10:42 - David;: I'll take my particulates thanks
12/06/2020, 10:43 - David;: This will probably be the conservative attitude I'll hold when I'm older then. I can't imagine ever coming to think this is ok.
12/06/2020, 10:43 - / James Ball: Cavity wall insulation missing (assumed, not checked)
12/06/2020, 10:45 - / James Ball: You'll still be able to use the ByC burner just only burn fully seasoned hardwoods
12/06/2020, 10:46 - / James Ball: Which burn longer and release less shite
12/06/2020, 10:46 - David;: So now I'm chopping down virgin redwood forest. Great.
12/06/2020, 10:46 - David;: I can't wait
12/06/2020, 10:47 - / James Ball: The Snowdon sequoia
12/06/2020, 10:47 - David;: Also have they considered the embedded environmental and carbon costs of me transporting specially seasoned wood from miles away rather than picking it up by hand right outside my door.
12/06/2020, 10:47 - David;: I don't believe they have to be honest James
12/06/2020, 10:48 - / James Ball: Could always transport it without a vehicle
12/06/2020, 10:48 - / James Ball: Just horse and cart it up the track
12/06/2020, 10:48 - Rob;: The future looks a lot like the past, to quote David Mitchell the novelist
12/06/2020, 10:49 - / James Ball: Oak, beech, ash, elm, birch, sycamore are all hardwoods apparently
12/06/2020, 10:49 - / James Ball: It's your spruce, fir and pine that you want to avoid
12/06/2020, 10:49 - Rob;: You can buy those from firewood suppliers very easily
12/06/2020, 10:49 - David;: That's exactly what we have boundless supplies of
12/06/2020, 10:49 - / James Ball: The whole of the pinus genus
12/06/2020, 10:50 - Rob;: And they are naturally nicer to burn. An old slice of oak with bark on will set your life to rights all night
12/06/2020, 10:50 - David;: Jennifer Ennis' pinus genus
12/06/2020, 10:50 - / James Ball: I nice slice of oak and tea
12/06/2020, 10:51 - David;: That's fine if you happen to live in the middle of a deciduous oak forest.
12/06/2020, 10:51 - David;: All they gave us was acidic monoculture pine
12/06/2020, 10:51 - / James Ball: Nah just get a firewood supplier to dump a load at the top of the track
12/06/2020, 10:51 - David;: that's literally mental
12/06/2020, 10:52 - / James Ball: The plantation won't be there forever
12/06/2020, 10:52 - David;: driving wood into a forest region
12/06/2020, 10:52 - / James Ball: Concerted move to remove plantations and replace with natural deciduous woodland though
12/06/2020, 10:52 - David;: I think I will politely and sustainably breaking that law.
12/06/2020, 10:52 - / James Ball: Not actually law yet
12/06/2020, 10:53 - / James Ball: Burn away
12/06/2020, 10:54 - Rob;: And it's an England only ban on softwood fuels
12/06/2020, 10:55 - / James Ball: To be fair it's probably mostly targeting suburban homes with pointless wood burners not rural shepherd's cottages
12/06/2020, 10:56 - / James Ball: Things like traditional peat fires in Scotland are hella smokey but I doubt they'll ban them
12/06/2020, 10:56 - Rob;: This will turn me into a right wing libertarian
12/06/2020, 10:57 - David;: The campaign for real fire
12/06/2020, 10:58 - Phill: Dave, the old shit pits have probably broken down into a combustable peat like substance by now.
12/06/2020, 10:58 - Phill: Burn shit.
12/06/2020, 10:59 - Phill: Just little hods of shit drying on the hillside
12/06/2020, 10:59 - Phill: Stacked in the barn.
12/06/2020, 10:59 - David;: Great, I can't wait
12/06/2020, 10:59 - David;: This is what progress looks like. Me burning my own shit to stay warm
12/06/2020, 10:59 - Phill: The years where we are loads of crisps constantly would burn more intensely due to the oils
12/06/2020, 10:59 - Phill: Ate*
12/06/2020, 11:00 - Rob;: You'd know when a froust cake went on
12/06/2020, 11:00 - Phill: Lol. A bonus. You’d really get the thermometer shooting up.
12/06/2020, 11:00 - David;: Yeah it would light up like a christmas tree
12/06/2020, 11:00 - Phill: “Must be a froust cake”
12/06/2020, 11:01 - David;: 'Ah this log must be from the skipps seam'
12/06/2020, 11:01 - Rob;: Would be good if they released a powerful hallucigenic
12/06/2020, 11:01 - Rob;: More likely a powerful laxative
12/06/2020, 11:02 - Phill: You’d really struggle to ignite Sambo slurry.
12/06/2020, 11:02 - Phill: Like wet garage logs.
12/06/2020, 11:05 - / James Ball: The sparks and the excitement for a heavy froust log
12/06/2020, 11:05 - / James Ball: Burns with a slight blue ethanol flame
12/06/2020, 11:06 - David;: like bitumen.
12/06/2020, 11:07 - / James Ball: Very tacky
12/06/2020, 11:07 - / James Ball: Good for sealing a roof
12/06/2020, 11:09 - David;: You could do a classification of them into different fuel grades like in fractional distillation. The shit after a christmas dinner is like high grade refined jet fuel.
12/06/2020, 11:13 - Damian Rumble: Only 33,000 people infected currently in the UK. Seems a fairly manageable number...
12/06/2020, 11:14 - / James Ball: Not quite as manageable as 0 though is it
12/06/2020, 11:15 - Rob;: It did shoot up rather quickly from 0 if you remember
12/06/2020, 11:18 - Rob;: When we had 33,000 cases on the way up the curve on April 2nd, it was 65,000 cases 1 week later, 103,000 after 2. Go back to normal now and you get that
12/06/2020, 11:19 - Rob;: Worse actually, as that growth occurred during lockdown
12/06/2020, 11:19 - Rob;: With lower testing
12/06/2020, 11:20 - David;: But doesn't the increased testing mean that isn't comparable
12/06/2020, 11:21 - David;: I.e. we probably had lots more than 33,000 when we lasted tested that number
12/06/2020, 11:21 - David;: In fact we will still have lots more than that, but more % of cases are now detected I would guess.
12/06/2020, 11:22 - Rob;: Yeah, suppose absolute numbers are irrelevant due to testing variances
12/06/2020, 11:22 - David;: words are irrelevant
12/06/2020, 11:23 - Rob;: But the rate is everything - it can double in a week, so 30,000 is a huge number
12/06/2020, 11:24 - David;: Also who is getting it. Not so bad if shielding is effective and most of the cases are young people etc. Worse if it is concentrated in vulnerable demographics
12/06/2020, 11:24 - Rob;: Which it actually seems to be with the outbreaks in care homes
12/06/2020, 11:27 - Damian Rumble: I think the key difference is that the public are a lot better educated now than they were in February not to mention large parts of society where people would most likely mix closely are closed right now
12/06/2020, 11:28 - Damian Rumble: The overall R is just less than one now where as it was like 4 or 5 before lockdown if I remember correctly
12/06/2020, 11:32 - Rob;: In normal life R is between 3 and 4. Less than 1 with proper lockdown and seemingly just under 1 in most places with he current regulations. If you're advocating carrying on as we are for the foreseeable, cases should decline. Change anything, as the government is, and it will go up, from a higher starting point than before. At that point you have to make things stricter again.
12/06/2020, 11:34 - / James Ball: But sadly most people don't give a shit even if they know about it
12/06/2020, 11:35 - / James Ball: I'm pretty wary right noe as I had a day of work on Wednesday, indoors, occasionally less than 2m, with someone known to have had symptoms (more than two weeks ago)
12/06/2020, 11:47 - David;: This is ignoring track and trace which in theory allows more loosening with the same R rate by targetting isolation.
12/06/2020, 11:48 - David;: If people actually use and follow it
12/06/2020, 11:48 - David;: But seems to have been implemented in a somewhat shambolic way
12/06/2020, 11:52 - Rob;: Yeah, I'm refusing to acknowledge it as a viable thing
12/06/2020, 11:53 - Rob;: Even the people running it say it won't be fit for purpose until September
12/06/2020, 11:55 - / James Ball: Very British, very shit
12/06/2020, 11:57 - Rob;: If we had locked down one week earlier, not had a key member of government flout the rules and got a proper track and trace system in place, we would have it pretty under control. All very doable things
12/06/2020, 12:18 - Damian Rumble: Basically done what Germany had done then. Yes a very avoidable tragedy.
12/06/2020, 12:40 - David;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-dS2McPYzEE
12/06/2020, 12:41 - David;: Lol just watched this short film which Jamie xx used samples from in Gosh. From 9.00 - the level of bloot.
12/06/2020, 14:00 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 14:01 - Paul;: Lol Man U fucking shit
12/06/2020, 14:01 - Paul;: Dat City
12/06/2020, 14:02 - Rob;: This seems quite out of step with the nation as a whole
12/06/2020, 14:02 - Paul;: Why have they got you doing football stuff
12/06/2020, 14:02 - Paul;: You frisbee
12/06/2020, 14:03 - Paul;: Tottenham got a fair representation
12/06/2020, 14:03 - Phill: When you say personalise what you actually mean infiltrate and advertise
12/06/2020, 14:03 - Jack G;: This leads me to believe it’s a load of bollocks
12/06/2020, 14:04 - Phill: Ajax more fans then Madrid. Sure.
12/06/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: @447854020575 how much do you trust this data
12/06/2020, 14:04 - Paul;: It seems to be complete shit
12/06/2020, 14:04 - Rob;: Where's that David Icke it's a piece of shit gif when you need it?
12/06/2020, 14:05 - Rob;: Why is there an entry for Real and Real Madrid?
12/06/2020, 14:06 - Damian Rumble: It will be based towards the teams that were on the TV the most last year, i.e. Tottenham and Liverpool as the made the champions League final
12/06/2020, 14:07 - Paul;: So how is that predicting the team they support?
12/06/2020, 14:07 - Paul;: How have you been given data power and all you’ve done is chart tv hours
12/06/2020, 14:11 - Paul;: Boss is happy with this work is he?
12/06/2020, 14:14 - Phill: Hey guys I’m creating a model that predicts what shows people like based on what shows they’re watching.
12/06/2020, 14:16 - Sam;: Do some sentiment analysis on the response to your model.
12/06/2020, 14:18 - Damian Rumble: Funnily enough how many months you've had broadband for and post code don't correlate very well with football team support
12/06/2020, 14:19 - Sam;: I was born with that knowledge
12/06/2020, 14:19 - Sam;: First thing I knew
12/06/2020, 14:20 - Paul;: Why is how many months they’ve had broadband for being used as a variable?
12/06/2020, 14:21 - Paul;: Solid research that says longer you have bt broadband the more likely you are to support Norwich?
12/06/2020, 14:22 - / James Ball: You can always find a correlation if you look hard enough and ignore enough data
12/06/2020, 14:22 - Paul;: Post code indicating football team I can see as making more sense but I’m not the data scientist here
12/06/2020, 14:23 - Phill: I’ve had broadband for 12 years so I must be a Leicester fan.
12/06/2020, 14:23 - Rob;: Wigan fans ❤️ telecoms
12/06/2020, 14:23 - Sam;: Just ask them. That’s what sky sports do
12/06/2020, 14:23 - Phill: Lol postcode NOT correlative. U wot?
12/06/2020, 14:24 - Paul;: Damo we need answers
12/06/2020, 14:24 - Paul;: How are you able to get away with this
12/06/2020, 14:25 - Phill: This poor algorithm engineering is the same reason I get fucking Huel ads all time time.
12/06/2020, 14:25 - Phill: >huel
12/06/2020, 14:26 - / James Ball: On Reddit all I see is huel
12/06/2020, 14:26 - Phill: And I love food.
12/06/2020, 14:26 - / James Ball: And depression ads
12/06/2020, 14:26 - Phill: I don’t want my food replaced by a nutrition slurry
12/06/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: But young male = only want protein food shakes
12/06/2020, 14:27 - / James Ball: That's what Damo's science says
12/06/2020, 14:29 - Paul;: @447854020575 did you have no suspicion over your results? Blind faith in the data always
12/06/2020, 14:30 - Paul;: How do you go from complete raw fucking shit to something meaningful. You produced the worst data we’ve seen
12/06/2020, 14:30 - Damian Rumble: The Dickinson rage is brewing
12/06/2020, 14:36 - Damian Rumble: Though in all seriousness this has been a successful alpha test. Lots of good qualitative data gathered
12/06/2020, 14:38 - Paul;: From the data it would indicate your largest customer base is Liverpool then Tottenham and for some reason a huge amount of customers in Barcelona
12/06/2020, 15:21 - David;: This is complete shit
12/06/2020, 15:23 - David;: Lol this reasoning
12/06/2020, 15:24 - David;: That explains Ajax having more fans than Man Mtd then.
12/06/2020, 15:24 - David;: and the Spurs figure
12/06/2020, 15:25 - David;: So by this logic everyone who watched the champions league final last season became a liverpool or spurs fan overnight?
12/06/2020, 15:45 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: This data is still terrible
12/06/2020, 15:46 - Damian Rumble: Yeah I know. There is no mention of Arsenal at all.
12/06/2020, 15:47 - Paul;: No idea what you’re trying to get out of this but the data set you’re using is definitely wrong
12/06/2020, 15:47 - Damian Rumble: Like I know they are terrible but they must have at least one fan out there
12/06/2020, 15:48 - Paul;: You need to harvest a season of data
12/06/2020, 15:48 - Paul;: At least
12/06/2020, 15:48 - Sam;: BLM protest in Stratford. Two absolute wasters start arguing with them. Clutching their fosters. Stratfords finest counter protesters
12/06/2020, 16:12 - David;: Do you only have TV viewing data to work with? I think this will never get you to fans because that's largely determined by what's televised by the broadcasters, which is based largely on season and title race dynamics plus a formula where they have to show teams a minimum number of times.
12/06/2020, 16:12 - David;: So e.g. a watford fan who is a general football fan will have to watch lots more of liverpool and man city than watford simply because that's what's on
12/06/2020, 16:14 - David;: Plus when they do watch Watford it is probably against one of those teams so would still show up as them watching liverpool or city
12/06/2020, 16:19 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-53020335
12/06/2020, 16:27 - Damian Rumble: We tried linking up with Twitter but the problem is joining on postcode is not person specific plus postcode is a terrible match for football support. Think a Manchester postcode would point at man u or man city. Getting it wrong would be very costly.
12/06/2020, 16:28 - Damian Rumble: I think our analysis will have to be limited to champions League teams. Not enough premier League matches are streamed on BT sadly
12/06/2020, 16:30 - Paul;: Put shit in get shit out
12/06/2020, 16:31 - David;: This won't predict fans though, people just watch the champions league anyway
12/06/2020, 16:31 - David;: I probably watch more champions league games that liverpool are not involved in than they are
12/06/2020, 16:31 - Paul;: It would also help if you knew football
12/06/2020, 16:32 - David;: What error bars are you putting on those figures?
12/06/2020, 19:24 - Sam;: What are your managers expecting from this?
12/06/2020, 19:24 - Sam;: Single pie chart on the deliverables?
12/06/2020, 19:34 - Damian Rumble: Well I am the manager so whatever I god damn want
12/06/2020, 19:34 - Sam;: You’re CEO of BT.
12/06/2020, 19:35 - Damian Rumble: Basically stylise the website/marketing
12/06/2020, 19:35 - Damian Rumble: With pie charts
12/06/2020, 19:35 - Damian Rumble: All the pies
12/06/2020, 19:36 - Paul;: How did you decide this was a good idea?!?
12/06/2020, 19:37 - Paul;: Surely someone will have to vet this
12/06/2020, 19:37 - Sam;: You are not responsible for the website.
12/06/2020, 19:39 - / James Ball: Lol if damo was responsible for the website
12/06/2020, 20:06 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 20:12 - Damian Rumble: I am responsible for machine learning on the website
12/06/2020, 20:20 - David;: So you put that pie chart on the BT website? When does it go live?
12/06/2020, 20:25 - Paul;: And how much input do you get on marketing when you tell the marketing manager all the budget should just go on Liverpool and Tottenham?
12/06/2020, 20:50 - Phill: The Martian. Such a great film.
12/06/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: Having to communicate how he does would really fuck me off
12/06/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: That is a good space film unlike gravity
12/06/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: Eating shit potatoes too
12/06/2020, 20:52 - / James Ball: Gravity was very annoying and Hollywood
12/06/2020, 20:52 - / James Ball: Interstellar is great too
12/06/2020, 20:53 - Paul;: Yeah interstellar one of my top films
12/06/2020, 20:53 - Phill: Interstellar is goat space film
12/06/2020, 20:54 - Rob;: Like the wave world and time stuff in Interstellar a lot
12/06/2020, 20:55 - Rob;: Goes a bit mad later on
12/06/2020, 20:56 - Rob;: I didn't get round to seeing Ad Astra last year, did any of you?
12/06/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Ad Astra got panned
12/06/2020, 21:00 - Paul;: Seen it
12/06/2020, 21:00 - Rob;: Nah
12/06/2020, 21:00 - Rob;: 84% rotten tomatoes
12/06/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: Very good 3/4 of it then turns dull
12/06/2020, 21:01 - Rob;: 4/5 empire
12/06/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: You can’t trust critics
12/06/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: I’ve always said this. They know shit. You need the IMDb reviews
12/06/2020, 21:01 - Rob;: Well if it got panned as Sam said, that would mean it's good
12/06/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Nah critics know nothing
12/06/2020, 21:03 - Rob;: Joel loved it. That's enough for me
12/06/2020, 21:03 - Sam;: It’s derivative
12/06/2020, 21:04 - Sam;: Want to be the next interstellar
12/06/2020, 21:04 - Rob;: Crucially, I haven't seen it
12/06/2020, 21:04 - Rob;: But had wanted to watch
12/06/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: I am currently watching a shit film called Ice Quake because Julia loves terrible disaster movies
12/06/2020, 21:06 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 21:06 - Rob;: That discrepancy
12/06/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: Critics don’t pick films the rabble enjoy
12/06/2020, 21:07 - Rob;: Surely the audience score is the rabble here?
12/06/2020, 21:07 - Paul;: Write pithy nonsense to impress guardian readers
12/06/2020, 21:08 - Phill: Deep Impact. big.
12/06/2020, 21:08 - Paul;: Yeah and they hate it
12/06/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: She lives that, but we're talking far worse than that
12/06/2020, 21:09 - Sam;: Event horizon is a cracker. Horror in space
12/06/2020, 21:09 - Rob;: Sorry i'm too pissed to have read the word 'don't' there
12/06/2020, 21:09 - Phill: Geostorm?
12/06/2020, 21:09 - Rob;: We watched that at the shaft. Very deep into a froust
12/06/2020, 21:10 - Paul;: Geostorm worthy of being shit. The day after tomorrow GOAT
12/06/2020, 21:11 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. That was a Framestore one. Remember interviewing the VFX guy on it and he was just like, this is the biggest piece of shit I've ever done. Put that on the website.
12/06/2020, 21:11 - Rob;: The shart*
12/06/2020, 21:12 - / James Ball: love it
12/06/2020, 21:12 - / James Ball: sphere is on a similar vein to event horizon
12/06/2020, 21:13 - Paul;: Contact. Huge film
12/06/2020, 21:13 - Paul;: If you know what’s good for you
12/06/2020, 21:13 - / James Ball: ah yeah, that's good
12/06/2020, 21:15 - / James Ball: ex machina I thought was ok. I wouldn't watch again but might be worth a little friday night snaffle
12/06/2020, 21:15 - Rob;: Ah I liked that a lot
12/06/2020, 21:16 - / James Ball: mad max fury road is basically 2 hours of action
12/06/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: Ex Machina much more than annihilation
12/06/2020, 21:17 - / James Ball: looper
12/06/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: Ex machina couldn’t get into
12/06/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: Looper yes
12/06/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: Annihilation would have liked more creepy intense bits
12/06/2020, 21:17 - Paul;: 2001 space odyssey. Dull
12/06/2020, 21:18 - Paul;: But critics tell you it’s the best film ever
12/06/2020, 21:18 - Phill: Looper is great.
12/06/2020, 21:18 - Phill: Hipster trash.
12/06/2020, 21:19 - Paul;: Haven’t seen Solaris. Anyone seen that?
12/06/2020, 21:20 - Paul;: Would anticipate that to be very critic heavy but actually shit
12/06/2020, 21:21 - Sam;: MOON
12/06/2020, 21:21 - Paul;: 65/100
12/06/2020, 21:21 - Paul;: Passengers better than I thought it would be. Panned by critics of course
12/06/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: Very easy watching
12/06/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: Enjoyable
12/06/2020, 21:23 - Sam;: I only watch Fellini Films
12/06/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: Moon is enjoyable
12/06/2020, 21:25 - / James Ball: Very british
12/06/2020, 21:30 - Paul;: Wallace and grommets a grand day out
12/06/2020, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: Lol
12/06/2020, 21:37 - Damian Rumble: Interstellar is a pile of crap
12/06/2020, 21:37 - Sam;: Not enough equations for you? Ph fucking D
12/06/2020, 21:38 - Phill: Lol stay mad
12/06/2020, 21:39 - Paul;: What’s your top space film and film in general @447854020575
12/06/2020, 21:40 - Damian Rumble: Rate this. Couldn't sleep for hours after watching that
12/06/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: The Chumscrubber
12/06/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: The Greasy Strangler
12/06/2020, 21:41 - Rob;: Katherine Cookson's The Girl
12/06/2020, 21:42 - Rob;: Top three
12/06/2020, 21:45 - Damian Rumble: Definitely a fan of moon
12/06/2020, 21:46 - Rob;: Discussing Armageddon. Have got stuck on the idea that they thought it easier to train drillers as astronauts, rather than train astronauts as drillers
12/06/2020, 21:47 - Damian Rumble: Tbh stellar is bad because the the first half of it is just the guy mopping about on his farm doing fuck all. It's just boring. The. The second half where he actually goes into space is just so totally different. It's like they crudely mashed two films together
12/06/2020, 21:48 - Damian Rumble: Deep impact > Armageddon
12/06/2020, 21:48 - Rob;: True
12/06/2020, 21:48 - Paul;: Armageddon still good but no deep impact
12/06/2020, 21:49 - Damian Rumble: Very difficult one. I'm not sure about space film give me a moment to do my research. However my favourite of all time is probably "a life in a day"
12/06/2020, 21:53 - Damian Rumble: Pandorum is pretty decent sci fi wise
12/06/2020, 21:55 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 21:56 - Hamish Sinclair: A good vintage
12/06/2020, 21:57 - / James Ball: A fine year. Now a year out of date but only increased the richness and tang
12/06/2020, 21:58 - Paul;: Nothing on the yarrow cupboard condiments
12/06/2020, 21:58 - / James Ball: True
12/06/2020, 21:59 - / James Ball: I can still smell that rancid butter from a year or so ago
12/06/2020, 22:00 - Paul;: lol yeah that butter
12/06/2020, 22:01 - Paul;: The taste of dusty 5yr old marmite
12/06/2020, 22:01 - Paul;: *ketchup
12/06/2020, 22:02 - / James Ball: Does anyone remember the special vintage marmite they used to sell?
12/06/2020, 22:03 - / James Ball: I've got some very out of date marmite. Turns out it tastes identical to the "marmite XO" they used to make
12/06/2020, 22:11 - Paul;: Any oxo cubes
12/06/2020, 22:15 - David;: Interstellar is gash
12/06/2020, 22:15 - David;: Moon is great
12/06/2020, 22:15 - David;: Arrival is goat
12/06/2020, 22:15 - David;: Gravity is trash
12/06/2020, 22:15 - David;: Martian is great
12/06/2020, 22:20 - David;: Agree
12/06/2020, 22:23 - David;: I can't compute this with her personality
12/06/2020, 22:23 - David;: Did she like the war of the world's film?
12/06/2020, 22:24 - Damian Rumble: Definitely rate
12/06/2020, 22:25 - Paul;: Agreed. 10/10
12/06/2020, 22:25 - Sam;: How? What? Where?
12/06/2020, 22:26 - Paul;: Oblivion. 5.5/10
12/06/2020, 22:26 - Paul;: Edge of tomorrow 9/10
12/06/2020, 22:27 - Damian Rumble: I actually loved this film. I feel like I should have hated it but actually not
12/06/2020, 22:27 - Paul;: Great film
12/06/2020, 22:28 - Paul;: Total recall 9/10
12/06/2020, 22:28 - Phill: >pretending to be this woke.
12/06/2020, 22:28 - Damian Rumble: The problem with oblivion was that it was basically a rip off of a bunch of over scifi movies
12/06/2020, 22:28 - Paul;: Alien 2 - 8.5/10
12/06/2020, 22:28 - Damian Rumble: Good shout. Classic
12/06/2020, 22:28 - Paul;: Prometheus - 7/10
12/06/2020, 22:29 - Phill: No
12/06/2020, 22:29 - Damian Rumble: This though... Not goat. The anti-goat
12/06/2020, 22:29 - Phill: Yes.
12/06/2020, 22:29 - Damian Rumble: Agreed. This was terrible
12/06/2020, 22:29 - Damian Rumble: Should never have been made
12/06/2020, 22:30 - Paul;: Total recall is excellent. Pleb
12/06/2020, 22:30 - Damian Rumble: Please tell you talking about the original here
12/06/2020, 22:30 - Paul;: Yes obviously
12/06/2020, 22:31 - Paul;: Blade runner the latest one 8/10
12/06/2020, 22:31 - Damian Rumble: We watched this other day. Two hours of my life I am not getting back
12/06/2020, 22:31 - Paul;: But can only watch once
12/06/2020, 22:31 - Phill: Nah get fucked. 1/10 so shit.
12/06/2020, 22:32 - Paul;: Predator 6/10
12/06/2020, 22:34 - Paul;: Sunshine 8/10
12/06/2020, 22:36 - Paul;: Apollo 13 - 9/10
12/06/2020, 22:36 - Paul;: The fifth element - 10/10
12/06/2020, 22:36 - Rob;: Yeah very good. Not your typical cruise film
12/06/2020, 22:37 - Damian Rumble: Also agreed. Visually/audio great. But the plot was basically a rip _off_ of 'her'. No where near as good as the original
12/06/2020, 22:37 - Phill: For a realistic review take what Paul gives it and subtract 3
12/06/2020, 22:37 - David;: Philosophical depth 0/10. Consistency of tone 0/10. Interest in characters and plot 0/10.  Effects 6/10. Performances 2/10.
12/06/2020, 22:38 - David;: Interstellar was the biggest cinematic dissapointment of my life. Wanted to like it
12/06/2020, 22:38 - Damian Rumble: Sunshine 8, Apollo 13 8, the fifth element 6. Predator not seen
12/06/2020, 22:39 - Paul;: Got to put some reviews up
12/06/2020, 22:39 - Rob;: Geography degree. Huge love of natural disasters
12/06/2020, 22:40 - Sam;: I thought you only watch cartoons Phil?
12/06/2020, 22:41 - Paul;: Akira 10/10
12/06/2020, 22:42 - David;: Her is good
12/06/2020, 22:42 - David;: 8/10

12/06/2020, 22:43 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
12/06/2020, 22:44 - Phill: Exclusively. I don’t even know any of the films people are talking about here just passing the titles through my algorithm which tells me how good a film is subjectively based on people’s reviews of said film. It’s innovative and pioneering.
12/06/2020, 22:44 - Rob;: Aliens is good, but diluted the fear factor by having loads of aliens that you see early and are easy to kill. Alien still the best of the series.  Prometheus a tired nonsensical retred
12/06/2020, 22:44 - Rob;: Classic
12/06/2020, 22:44 - Paul;: Not seen alien
12/06/2020, 22:44 - Paul;: The thing 8.5/10
12/06/2020, 22:45 - Rob;: One of my favourite films
12/06/2020, 22:45 - Rob;: Researched the thing aged 31 and didn't get me as hard as aged 14
12/06/2020, 22:45 - Rob;: *rewatched
12/06/2020, 22:46 - Paul;: What does that mean
12/06/2020, 22:46 - Phill: Robs favourite porno.
12/06/2020, 22:46 - Sam;: It got you hard?
12/06/2020, 22:46 - Rob;: Lol
12/06/2020, 22:46 - Paul;: Starship troopers 9/10
12/06/2020, 22:47 - Paul;: Dark city 7/10
12/06/2020, 22:47 - Paul;: Gattaca 5/10
12/06/2020, 22:47 - Rob;: Not even a typo, was trying to explain that it was terrifying as a kid, but slightly silly as an adult
12/06/2020, 22:48 - Phill: Credibility gone.
12/06/2020, 22:48 - Paul;: Nah you dumb
12/06/2020, 22:48 - Paul;: Starship troopers is brilliant
12/06/2020, 22:49 - Paul;: So easy watching. Action packed. Better cgi than today’s films
12/06/2020, 22:50 - Paul;: Avatar 3/10
12/06/2020, 22:51 - Sam;: Yeah. A great comment on nationalism
12/06/2020, 22:51 - Rob;: Glad 3D cinema is dead
12/06/2020, 22:51 - Rob;: > glasses over glasses
12/06/2020, 22:52 - Rob;: > Seeing the Big Short in 3D
12/06/2020, 22:53 - Paul;: >the big long
12/06/2020, 22:54 - Paul;: Planet of the apes 4.5/10
12/06/2020, 22:56 - Paul;: Elysium 1/10
12/06/2020, 23:09 - / James Ball: I remember you being obsessed with this when we were like 16
12/06/2020, 23:11 - Paul;: Do I no remember this. Only seen it 3 times
12/06/2020, 23:12 - / James Ball: I'm sure you had it recorded on sky plus. Christine very unhappy with it. Derek no problem
12/06/2020, 23:12 - Paul;: It’s a 15!
12/06/2020, 23:14 - / James Ball: That sounds like a Christine problem
12/06/2020, 23:15 - Paul;: Sounds like a false memory
12/06/2020, 23:15 - / James Ball: Lol totally invented
12/06/2020, 23:15 - Paul;: Are you sure you’re not thinking of species
12/06/2020, 23:15 - / James Ball: Possible it was much earlier
12/06/2020, 23:15 - / James Ball: When we were more like 12
12/06/2020, 23:15 - Paul;: Yes
12/06/2020, 23:16 - / James Ball: That would fit better
12/06/2020, 23:16 - Paul;: Species. Recorded on vhs
12/06/2020, 23:16 - Paul;: You are fake news
12/06/2020, 23:16 - / James Ball: Nah. Not species
12/06/2020, 23:17 - Paul;: Well that’s what it would have been

12/06/2020, 23:21 - Damian Rumble: How do you feel about inception? 11/10
12/06/2020, 23:22 - / James Ball: Inception too long
12/06/2020, 23:22 - / James Ball: Could have made it better by removing a load of shit from it
12/06/2020, 23:24 - Paul;: Inception 9.6/10
12/06/2020, 23:25 - Sam;: This message was deleted
12/06/2020, 23:26 - Rob;: I was enjoying the mundanity of that

https://amp.theatlantic.com/amp/article/281236/
12/06/2020, 23:41 - Damian Rumble: I actually read the starship troopers book the film is based on. Easily the worst piece of fiction I have ever read
12/06/2020, 23:54 - / James Ball: Not much you like tonight is there Damo
13/06/2020, 01:12 - David;: Huge scope. 9/10
13/06/2020, 01:13 - David;: Remember this
13/06/2020, 01:15 - David;: Star ship troopers is indeed great. Big metaphor for everything dressed up as a shit film

13/06/2020, 18:52 - David;: Lol the far right Nazi saluting as they protect a Churchill statue
13/06/2020, 18:52 - David;: Do they know?
13/06/2020, 19:13 - / James Ball: <Media omitted>
13/06/2020, 19:19 - David;: What's the recipe
13/06/2020, 19:20 - David;: Is it like cordial but with yeast added
13/06/2020, 19:22 - / James Ball: No added yeast, just natural yeasts from the air
13/06/2020, 19:22 - / James Ball: 10L water, 5 small lemons, 2 or 3 tablespoons of white wine vinegar, 1Kg sugar about 10 large heads of elderflower
13/06/2020, 19:23 - Phill: Dip your bollies in there for added yeast
13/06/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: Put it all in a sanitised container and wait for it to go a bit mouldy
13/06/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: Leave for another day or so
13/06/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: Strain off everything with muslin cloths and sieve
13/06/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: Put in bottles
13/06/2020, 19:24 - / James Ball: Will be good to go a week or so after that
13/06/2020, 19:26 - / James Ball: Bottles need to be able to withstand a lot of pressure as it will produce a lot of CO2
13/06/2020, 19:26 - Phill: Use plastic tonic water bottles
13/06/2020, 19:27 - Phill: Or similar
13/06/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: Yeah bought a load of water from Lidl earlier and used the water for the brew
13/06/2020, 19:27 - Paul;: Glass > plastic
13/06/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: Nah. Glass will probably shatter
13/06/2020, 19:27 - Paul;: What is a champagne bottle
13/06/2020, 19:27 - Phill: Made elderflower champagne before with glass and it shattered after a few days
13/06/2020, 19:27 - / James Ball: That's why champagne bottles are big and heavy
13/06/2020, 19:28 - Phill: What is commercial bottling vs home brewing
13/06/2020, 19:28 - / James Ball: Yeah, would need hefty bottles and corking
13/06/2020, 19:29 - / James Ball: It's going in 2L water bottles and will be pressing out the air to allow more volume for expansion
13/06/2020, 21:55 - David;: White lines - great watch
13/06/2020, 22:10 - Damian Rumble: I've seen two episodes so far. I hate all of characters but the soundtrack is excellent
13/06/2020, 22:24 - David;: What is Martin braithwaite. 8 goals in 36 appearences for Middleborough. 29 years old. Who should come knocking but Barcelona
13/06/2020, 22:27 - Rob;: Emergency signing. Now has a 300m release clause
13/06/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: I can't get my head around that either

14/06/2020, 13:05 - Paul;: Fantasy football then. What do
14/06/2020, 13:05 - Paul;: I’ve made sweeping changes
14/06/2020, 13:05 - Paul;: Deployed a triple captaincy
14/06/2020, 13:05 - Rob;: Big. Only old data to go off
14/06/2020, 13:06 - David;: I can't get close to it
14/06/2020, 13:06 - David;: I can't engage with Guardiola's Troll carousel.
14/06/2020, 13:06 - David;: I'm out. No city players. Refuse to acknowledge them.
14/06/2020, 13:20 - Paul;: Rob how are arsenal. More importantly how’s your Pepe
14/06/2020, 13:22 - Rob;: We were in decent form before the break, and Arteta seems promising. Have got some fullbacks back from injury now, which could help. Both Lacazatte and Auba fit.
14/06/2020, 13:22 - Rob;: Game in hand against city though
14/06/2020, 13:23 - Rob;: Pepe will probably play
14/06/2020, 13:24 - Paul;: He might be part of my new setup
14/06/2020, 13:24 - Paul;: In talks with him now
14/06/2020, 13:26 - Rob;: He was getting better, but hasn't been consistent for us so far. Aubameyang is our only proper performer and he = bunce
14/06/2020, 13:46 - David;: Obviously Saint-Maximin stays
14/06/2020, 13:46 - David;: that's the only firm conclusion I've reached
14/06/2020, 13:53 - Paul;: Saint-knocksemin
14/06/2020, 17:19 - David;: The fake fans sounds surprisingly un-shit
14/06/2020, 17:19 - David;: Not sure how they're pulling that off
14/06/2020, 17:24 - Sam;: I’m a fan of fake fans. Take the edge off. Never been so aware of the sound of a ball being kicked.
14/06/2020, 17:32 - Rob;: Yeah, they're not good in their own right, they're just not immediately and obviously unnatural like the weird silence and echoes
14/06/2020, 17:36 - David;: Yeah it just adds background drone
14/06/2020, 17:36 - David;: You need a drone
14/06/2020, 17:38 - David;: It looks a bit odd with camera angles clearly showing an empty stadium but usually you're not seeing the stands so you sort of forget about it.
14/06/2020, 17:42 - David;: Drone > no drone
14/06/2020, 17:43 - Rob;: They should bring in the vuvuzelas
14/06/2020, 17:43 - Rob;: Relive the dullest world cup so far
14/06/2020, 17:43 - Sam;: Hopefully the fan mosaics’ that some clubs will help to gloss over empty seats.
14/06/2020, 17:43 - Sam;: Worked in the Bundesliga
14/06/2020, 17:43 - Rob;: Today would have been England's first Euro 2020 match. Think how good that could have been in this weather
14/06/2020, 17:44 - Rob;: How blooted we would be
14/06/2020, 17:44 - David;: Yeah best not to dwell on that
14/06/2020, 17:45 - David;: I was hearing some shit where they were going to put a picture of the actual individual faces of season ticket holders and placing that on a cardboard cut out in their seat
14/06/2020, 17:45 - David;: Sounds mental and not in any way worth the effort
14/06/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: They allowed Australian fans to upload pictures of themselves and Harold Shipman and Hitler ended up watching a game
14/06/2020, 17:46 - David;: You just dont need that level of crowd granularity
14/06/2020, 17:47 - David;: I guess they could pipe through a special angle from roughly your bit of the stadium to season ticket holders?
14/06/2020, 17:47 - David;: Give you the experience of watching live from the seat you would be in
14/06/2020, 17:48 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
14/06/2020, 17:48 - David;: Lol, this
14/06/2020, 17:48 - David;: Sorry for a moment there I couldn't work out if you'd posted a picture of an actual crowd
14/06/2020, 17:49 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
14/06/2020, 17:50 - David;: Makes it look like some cell shaded gamecube game
14/06/2020, 17:50 - Rob;: Paper Mario
14/06/2020, 17:51 - David;: It's better than literally rows of empty seats that's all you can say for it
14/06/2020, 17:51 - Rob;: Wonder if they will get huge advertising hoardings
14/06/2020, 17:56 - Sam;: At tv viewing angle it just looks like full seats
14/06/2020, 17:56 - David;: Sam. United starting line-up post-COVID. Talk to me.
14/06/2020, 17:56 - David;: I've heard about a little fella called Greenwood.
14/06/2020, 18:00 - Paul;: Got greenwood in already. Key to my pre covid team
14/06/2020, 18:01 - David;: The 5 sub thing will change everything
14/06/2020, 18:02 - David;: City players a write off, rotation everywhere
14/06/2020, 18:03 - Paul;: I have everything riding on city in the opening week
14/06/2020, 18:05 - David;: You can't trust city
14/06/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: I think I’ve been eating so much shit I need to take a gamble
14/06/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: A change in diet
14/06/2020, 18:07 - David;: Be prepared for constant trolling. Aguero not in the matchday squad, that sort of shit.
14/06/2020, 18:07 - David;: It's inevitable.
14/06/2020, 18:08 - David;: Sterling benched, all the old guardiola tricks
14/06/2020, 18:08 - Paul;: Nah he couldn’t
14/06/2020, 18:08 - Paul;: Wouldn’t do that
14/06/2020, 18:11 - David;: He will, he'll do it purely to spite you. He's like michael jordan in that regard, you've made it personal for him now
14/06/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: I think you should utilise the deadline for squad picking to the max. There’s nothing to go on, best hope is for reports on who is available that come out on the day of kick off. Will work for you Wednesday but weekends are tough
14/06/2020, 18:13 - David;: Yeah we need the pressies
14/06/2020, 18:13 - David;: Spurs. Will they still be a heap of shit?
14/06/2020, 18:13 - Paul;: 5pm Wednesday is the deadline
14/06/2020, 18:13 - Paul;: Kane is back?
14/06/2020, 18:13 - David;: Kane is able
14/06/2020, 18:14 - Paul;: He always trolls when I have him by doing fuck all. No doubt he’ll be back and scoring loads
14/06/2020, 18:14 - Rob;: I feel like any team you come up with is as good as any. Almost not worth making any changes beyond sorting out injuries and picking some players with easy games perhaps. There is no data to go on
14/06/2020, 18:14 - David;: He can't score in August. Does that transfer to when August will be at the end of a season?
14/06/2020, 18:15 - Rob;: Or will he think now is August as it's a beginning?
14/06/2020, 18:15 - David;: Yeah does this count as an August for harry kane goal drought purposes
14/06/2020, 18:19 - David;: Is brandon williams still a thing
14/06/2020, 18:20 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/scores-fixtures
14/06/2020, 18:22 - David;: I can't get close to this schedule. 3 fixtures on Thursday 25th, then only 1 on Saturday 27th.
14/06/2020, 18:26 - Sam;: He is but Shaw is likely to be no1. But the 3-5-2 was working well before COVID. Shaw as a third CB, dovetailing with Williams as LWB
14/06/2020, 20:33 - Damian Rumble: Team done. Salah and Mane are out. The die is cast.
14/06/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
14/06/2020, 21:27 - Paul;: Lol mental
14/06/2020, 21:28 - Paul;: But as verity said there’s always a girl with shit running down her leg on any night out
14/06/2020, 21:31 - / James Ball: Lol filth
14/06/2020, 21:45 - David;: Lol remember this
14/06/2020, 21:45 - David;: Always
15/06/2020, 10:04 - David;: People queuing for hours outside primark. Very embarassing
15/06/2020, 10:04 - Phill: Yeah lol
15/06/2020, 10:04 - David;: Can't wait another day for £2 pants
15/06/2020, 10:05 - Phill: We had a Maccys last night for the first time in 4 months. Decanted it onto a plate as didn’t want to touch boxes etc. When you do that it’s looks ducking disgusting.
15/06/2020, 10:05 - Phill: <Media omitted>
15/06/2020, 10:05 - Phill: Also thought we’d get high off the dopamine. But it actually tasted like shit and didn’t trigger any rush.
15/06/2020, 10:06 - Rob;: Yeah, plating has a hugely reductive quality
15/06/2020, 10:06 - Rob;: Also eating it in your own home adds grot
15/06/2020, 10:07 - Phill: I just think that 4 months of forced abstinence has broken the addictive quality of fast food.
15/06/2020, 10:07 - David;: Yeah without packaging now just looks less appealing than a home made burger
15/06/2020, 10:07 - David;: Maybe everyone has been forced to cold turkey off shite
15/06/2020, 10:09 - Rob;: If I get it proper fast food again I think I'll need to feel proper grotty first - way back from Wales, Glastonbury, hangover or post huge bout of exercise etc
15/06/2020, 10:11 - David;: There'll be a moment
15/06/2020, 10:12 - David;: Subway is an interesting middle category. Still grotty as fuck, but easier to justify
15/06/2020, 10:13 - Rob;: Yeah, it's got a facade of lunch on the go
15/06/2020, 10:13 - Rob;: 17 sauces, all of them mayonnaise and or sugar
15/06/2020, 10:14 - Rob;: Bread made of sugar and hope
15/06/2020, 10:14 - David;: But it's eat fresh rob
15/06/2020, 10:14 - David;: They've said fresh.
15/06/2020, 10:15 - Rob;: 6in meatball marinara has 12 calories fewer than a big mac
15/06/2020, 10:15 - Phill: It’s the same thing tho.
15/06/2020, 10:15 - Phill: Beef. Bread. Sauce.
15/06/2020, 10:16 - Rob;: Yeah, but not in their market positioning
15/06/2020, 10:17 - Rob;: That is probably the worst sub nutrition wise, the rest are much better
15/06/2020, 10:17 - David;: McDonalds always leaves me feeling strangely unsated
15/06/2020, 10:17 - David;: It's not actually that big or filling.
15/06/2020, 10:17 - David;: Just grease filling up the calories
15/06/2020, 10:18 - Rob;: Those tiny cheeseburgers that you could post through a letter box
15/06/2020, 10:18 - Rob;: Remind me of the limper pillows in Magnitogorsk
15/06/2020, 10:26 - Sam;: You’re doing McDonald’s wrong. Always ask for extra pickle on a bic mac, double cheese burger is a hidden gem, avoid nuggets and get selects if you need chicken
15/06/2020, 10:27 - Phill: I do get extra pickles. A quarter pounder with cheese is just a bigger cheeseburger. Selects are good but become expensive when sharing. Nugs better value.
15/06/2020, 10:28 - Phill: Please don’t take me for some kind of amateur.
15/06/2020, 10:28 - Sam;: Lol.
15/06/2020, 11:42 - / James Ball: McDonald's is fucking rank. I've had it once in the last 5 years and it was like eating a flaccid microwaved dick that had gone cold
15/06/2020, 11:43 - / James Ball: The Lidl in Witney is on the same little access road as McDonald's drive through. Always an enormous queue at about 5 or 6 as all the citizens line up to pay for their shit injections
15/06/2020, 11:47 - Rob;: A hot, hard, ovencooked dick would be fine
15/06/2020, 11:53 - Damian Rumble: Amen
15/06/2020, 11:55 - David;: Troy Deeney interviewed by Theroux
15/06/2020, 11:55 - David;: It's like when 2 of your friends from different contexts meet each other
15/06/2020, 11:59 - Sam;: Lol. How has that interview even occurred
15/06/2020, 12:00 - David;: He's doing this locky podcast where he interview someone each week
15/06/2020, 12:00 - David;: Deeney this week
15/06/2020, 12:01 - Rob;: I guess it's since Deeney has refused to train over safety concerns?
15/06/2020, 12:02 - David;: Hasn't got onto that yet to be honest, just shooting the shit
15/06/2020, 12:02 - David;: Touching on footballers wages
15/06/2020, 12:02 - David;: How he feels about his ranking on fifa
15/06/2020, 12:03 - Rob;: How does he feel?
15/06/2020, 12:04 - David;: He was saying that's based on analytics, I think inferring he has leadership skills and temperament that isn't reflected
15/06/2020, 12:19 - David;: He's rags to riches
15/06/2020, 12:51 - Rob;: That guy who pissed on the monument to a police officer had such a mad one
15/06/2020, 12:52 - Rob;: <Media omitted>

15/06/2020, 13:24 - / James Ball: Lol better just shovemental health issues. Actually just a lad on a 16 pinter
15/06/2020, 13:41 - / James Ball: Ah good. New coronavirus outbreak hits Beijing food market
15/06/2020, 14:01 - Damian Rumble: There was that report that implied that the outbreak first hit china in last august. Satellite images of massive upsurges in hospital track and internet searches for the coronavirus symptoms. Would very much lay waste to china's claims if proven
15/06/2020, 14:05 - / James Ball: https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/15/asia/coronavirus-beijing-outbreak-intl-hnk/index.html
15/06/2020, 14:05 - / James Ball: Happening now though
15/06/2020, 14:06 - / James Ball: Totally unreported on BBC. I guess it would rather dampen Boris' grand reopening if it was
15/06/2020, 14:12 - David;: 36 cases though
15/06/2020, 14:12 - David;: What are they worrying about
15/06/2020, 14:12 - / James Ball: No way that could spread
15/06/2020, 14:13 - David;: It's bound to happen constantly from now on. Imagine if cold and flu outbreaks were reported like that.
15/06/2020, 14:13 - David;: Think it will just become endemic in the population as another background seasonal illness
15/06/2020, 14:15 - Rob;: Yeah, local flare ups are inevitable
15/06/2020, 14:17 - / James Ball: I think the key here is that it's a repeat animal to human transmission at another food market
15/06/2020, 14:17 - / James Ball: Rather than being a human to human flare up
15/06/2020, 14:19 - Rob;: Where have you read that?
15/06/2020, 14:20 - Rob;: Article I just read suggested it was human to human.
15/06/2020, 14:20 - / James Ball: That's certainly the suggestion and the closure of the food market. Granted, no cause is given yet
15/06/2020, 14:21 - Rob;: I think a second crossing over from an animal species of exactly the same virus is far less likely than human to human transmission
15/06/2020, 14:22 - / James Ball: Agreed
15/06/2020, 14:22 - / James Ball: Hopefully they're being over zealous
15/06/2020, 14:22 - Rob;: That it's a market again is probably an indication of poor hygiene practices
15/06/2020, 14:23 - / James Ball: But it is still uncertain how the virus originated. It could have come from contaminated seafood or meat, or been transmitted by people who have come into the market via their secretions
15/06/2020, 14:23 - / James Ball: To quote the article
15/06/2020, 15:35 - Phill: A very Paul drink
15/06/2020, 15:35 - David;: It's caused by 5g electromagnetic fields, James

15/06/2020, 19:50 - Paul;: Lol nah this is ridiculous
15/06/2020, 19:56 - David;: No. Refuse to acknowledge this.
15/06/2020, 19:56 - Phill: But Dave, the BBC endorses this
15/06/2020, 19:59 - David;: So people are then pretending to be analysts of these sports.
15/06/2020, 19:59 - David;: A non existent job feeding off a non existent job
15/06/2020, 19:59 - Phill: Much in the same way a footballer analyses football, yes
15/06/2020, 20:00 - Phill: A LoL player analyses LoL
15/06/2020, 20:04 - David;: <Media omitted>
15/06/2020, 20:04 - David;: This is too ridiculous
15/06/2020, 20:05 - David;: >injuries
15/06/2020, 20:06 - David;: Gave himself type 2 diabetes because of the sport. And that's an athlete. At the pinnacle of the game.
15/06/2020, 20:06 - David;: A sport that actually makes you horribly unfit. That's the injury risk
15/06/2020, 20:08 - Phill: Stay mad that it doesn’t fit within your closed minded interpretation of competitive sport.
15/06/2020, 20:09 - Hamish Sinclair: The red zone
15/06/2020, 20:10 - David;: What would even make you genetically well suited to that. A tolerant adrenal system?
15/06/2020, 20:10 - / James Ball: To be fair the diabeetus is self inflicted. It's not required to drink energy drinks
15/06/2020, 20:10 - David;: Excellent melatonin control
15/06/2020, 20:11 - / James Ball: Apparently over 30 is end of career. No twitch response
15/06/2020, 20:11 - David;: Need it to stay at the top though. If everyone else is smashing it.
15/06/2020, 20:11 - David;: Can't lose that focus
15/06/2020, 20:13 - Paul;: The twitch response?
15/06/2020, 20:14 - / James Ball: Trigger finger
15/06/2020, 20:14 - / James Ball: Very quick actions
15/06/2020, 20:16 - Paul;: Need a mouse redesign so you can utilise your other fingers. Next.
15/06/2020, 20:16 - Phill: It’s the speed of the finger reflex
15/06/2020, 20:59 - / James Ball: Also you can already get mice that utilise more fingers
15/06/2020, 21:00 - Phill: Paul I have a mouse that has 12 buttons for thumb only
15/06/2020, 21:00 - Phill: Process that
15/06/2020, 21:01 - / James Ball: Mine has 4 thumb and technically 3 middle finger
15/06/2020, 21:01 - / James Ball: But I'm over 30 so my twitch response will now be trash
15/06/2020, 21:02 - Damian Rumble: First person ever quit professional sport to get fitter
15/06/2020, 21:02 - Phill: It’s why I need 12 thumb buttons
15/06/2020, 21:02 - Phill: Miniscule movements
15/06/2020, 21:02 - / James Ball: I'm certainly beyond winning any CS:GO matches now
15/06/2020, 21:31 - David;: Was that high on your to do list?
15/06/2020, 21:38 - / James Ball: No any more
15/06/2020, 23:36 - David;: Big rain
16/06/2020, 07:47 - Rob;: Nah.
16/06/2020, 07:48 - Rob;: Big rain in Royal L-Spa?
16/06/2020, 09:11 - David;: Yeah huge
16/06/2020, 09:11 - David;: Thunderstorm last night
16/06/2020, 09:32 - / James Ball: had big rain here at about half 3 / 4ish, went to see my parents and it had made it north to chippy by 6
16/06/2020, 16:35 - Paul;: https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cambridgeshire-53060894
16/06/2020, 16:35 - Paul;: Cancel everything
16/06/2020, 16:37 - Rob;: That just makes no sense
16/06/2020, 16:39 - Paul;: Lol this is too much
16/06/2020, 16:40 - Paul;: The heavily racist childhood we didn’t realise we were chomping through at breakfast
16/06/2020, 16:40 - Rob;: Reporting stuff like this just undermines proper change by diluting it with total shit
16/06/2020, 16:42 - Paul;: Yeah makes people a lot less likely to engage
16/06/2020, 16:47 - Rob;: Plays into the PC gone mad outlook
16/06/2020, 17:00 - / James Ball: hearing a lot of air about this "life saving drug" which appears to be steroids and have a 20-30% effectiveness
16/06/2020, 17:01 - Rob;: It could really help mitigate things before a  vaccine can be made available
16/06/2020, 17:03 - / James Ball: not doubting that, just the hyperbole around something which is so far only 30% effective at best
16/06/2020, 17:04 - / James Ball: If I was dying of covid I would want the steroids though
16/06/2020, 17:05 - Rob;: Yeah, I mean if it saves all most a third of lives of those on a venty, I would definitely want it
16/06/2020, 17:06 - Paul;: Isn’t 30% effective massive in a clinical context?
16/06/2020, 17:07 - Rob;: They estimate 5,000 deaths would have been saved so far in the UK so far had we known it was effective
16/06/2020, 17:08 - / James Ball: There'll be a subset of people now even less bothered about rules because there's a life saving drug now
16/06/2020, 17:09 - Rob;: Cue huge shortages of the drug and bungled production contracts
16/06/2020, 17:10 - / James Ball: Readily available and cheap to make apparently. 200,000 doses in the UK already
16/06/2020, 17:11 - Rob;: Ah, so we would have had enough to give to everyone who was even close to dying
16/06/2020, 17:12 - / James Ball: Yeah. Looks plausible. Cue pointlessly blaming someone for not giving out the drug sooner
16/06/2020, 17:12 - / James Ball: I thought they gave steroids already if you've got a nasty infection
16/06/2020, 17:13 - / James Ball: Try and boost you through it and to help dem gainz
16/06/2020, 17:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Depends on what actually leads to death. Steroids are immunosuppressive so risk is overwhelming infection. Lung damage in covid appears to be related to the immune response so dampening it down leads to better outcomes
16/06/2020, 17:16 - Stefan;: Contract covid. Develop pneumonia. Receive massive steroid dose. Get hench and recover. Winner.
16/06/2020, 17:19 - / James Ball: Ah ok I get it
16/06/2020, 17:20 - / James Ball: At least you'd look good at the funeral
16/06/2020, 17:21 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 17:27 - Rob;: That age bracket is particularly useful in this case
16/06/2020, 17:28 - / James Ball: So a possible trump level incident would be just everyone in USA demanding steriods for their covid infection but actually being in the first stage of the infection (not the secondary immuno response) and actually end up massively suppressing their immune systems and dying from the first infection
16/06/2020, 17:33 - Rob;: Sambo, Mr Sky Sports. What's my cheapest option to stream/cast Sky for the next couple of months?
16/06/2020, 17:34 - Rob;: £75 for 3 months (normally £102) now tv pass?
16/06/2020, 17:35 - Rob;: Which is two screens so can split with a mate
16/06/2020, 17:37 - Paul;: Dereks gone and got BT sport which includes now tv for free. 20 a month first 3 months then £40 a month thereafter
16/06/2020, 17:37 - Paul;: All the sport
16/06/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: That's very good. Possible to cancel? I have BT sport access already
16/06/2020, 17:39 - Paul;: Not sure. Must be a contract in there somewhere for a year or something but sport doesn’t have a break anymore so you sail right through into a new season anyway
16/06/2020, 17:42 - Sam;: Huge implications if true
16/06/2020, 17:42 - Sam;: Is it a deal he has access to because he’s a bt broadband badlad?
16/06/2020, 17:43 - Paul;: Hounding him for the truth, one moment
16/06/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 17:49 - Sam;: Yeah, contract renewal add on. Savage
16/06/2020, 17:49 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 17:50 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 17:50 - / James Ball: £900 for 2 years then. Not too bad I suppose
16/06/2020, 17:51 - Rob;: I'll just do my little NowTV pass for now I think
16/06/2020, 17:52 - Paul;: You’ll be safer with a now tv pass. It can’t hurt you
16/06/2020, 17:52 - Paul;: Can’t rope you into a contract
16/06/2020, 17:52 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
16/06/2020, 17:53 - Rob;: My credit rating got so battered by credit checks for moving house that I got rejected for a £10 a month sim card yesterday
16/06/2020, 17:53 - Rob;: I'm so dirt they won't even let me pay them £10 in return for data they can turn off any time
16/06/2020, 17:53 - Paul;: Remember damo fucked our credit rating as well
16/06/2020, 17:54 - Paul;: Doing searches on all of us
16/06/2020, 17:54 - Rob;: Cheers mate
16/06/2020, 17:54 - / James Ball: yeah that was great of him
16/06/2020, 17:55 - Paul;: Hopefully can get a job where I can perform endless credit checks on him
16/06/2020, 17:58 - Hamish Sinclair: Did this actually happen?
16/06/2020, 17:58 - Paul;: Yes
16/06/2020, 17:58 - Paul;: When he was at Aviva
16/06/2020, 17:59 - Paul;: Doesn’t think of any implications to his actions
16/06/2020, 18:00 - Jack G;: Just coming into this. So is nowtv general consensus for footy watching over next 2 months?
16/06/2020, 18:03 - Rob;: It's £34 per month, or £25 a month for 3 months before going up again. (You can cancel after 3). Can watch on two screens at once. Only SD
16/06/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: HD is £3 a month more.
16/06/2020, 18:05 - Paul;: You’ll need hd
16/06/2020, 18:05 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah got to be done then. Can’t be risking footybite streams, everyone will be on it so no bandwidth
16/06/2020, 18:07 - Rob;: Hd version gets you 3 screens, so could split 3 ways
16/06/2020, 18:10 - Paul;: Not even a decision
16/06/2020, 18:15 - David;: Huge rain
16/06/2020, 18:16 - Damian Rumble: Umm... What?
16/06/2020, 18:18 - Phill: Would split
16/06/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: You did credit checks on us all
16/06/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: When you were at shiva
16/06/2020, 18:19 - Paul;: *aviva
16/06/2020, 18:26 - Damian Rumble: No I didn't
16/06/2020, 18:28 - Rob;: You did
16/06/2020, 18:30 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 18:30 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 18:30 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 18:32 - Hamish Sinclair: lol this story is very reliant on phil not just making that up for troll
16/06/2020, 18:33 - / James Ball: was not a phil troll
16/06/2020, 18:33 - / James Ball: whole conversation was started by Damo saying he did a credit check on Phil
16/06/2020, 18:34 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 18:34 - Sam;: The goose is cooked
16/06/2020, 18:35 - Rob;: It doesn't make sense that if Damo couldn't find Phil on there, Phil's credit still had a check performed on it
16/06/2020, 18:35 - Stefan;: I still managed to get a mortgage, despite Damo leaving his hoof print on my credit rating
16/06/2020, 18:35 - Stefan;: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 18:36 - Rob;: As much as your were a complete arsehole for deciding to snoop around in our data, Damian.
16/06/2020, 18:36 - Paul;: Lol what’s young blue labour
16/06/2020, 18:36 - / James Ball: in other data breach news, It seems my Thames Water account has been tied to another James Ball living in SW London
16/06/2020, 18:37 - / James Ball: I can see his direct debit history
16/06/2020, 18:37 - Stefan;: Meant to be Labour but socially conservative. It's how you get national socialism
16/06/2020, 18:38 - Paul;: Everyone hates young blue labour?
16/06/2020, 18:41 - Hamish Sinclair: Theres a guy called Fahid Hussain who lives in halifax who has put my phone number into his bank details by accident
16/06/2020, 18:41 - Hamish Sinclair: I get a text every time he is about to go overdrawn
16/06/2020, 18:42 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
16/06/2020, 18:44 - / James Ball: get it together Fahid
16/06/2020, 18:44 - Hamish Sinclair: yeah, he lives very hand to mouth
16/06/2020, 18:44 - Phill: Also gets paid fortnightly
16/06/2020, 18:44 - / James Ball: in this case I've got a relatively new account and they seem to have just merged my account with an existing one. I've just registered an online account and have subsequently assumed control of both accounts now.
16/06/2020, 18:47 - Damian Rumble: Oh I see what the problem is here. When I say Experian database I don't mean Experian's credit system. I mean the third party demographic segmentation that Experian sell as a by product to their credit score business. The work I did was entirely limited with Aviva and couldn't possibly impact your credit score. I assumed Phil was trolling me at the time and ignored him.
16/06/2020, 19:21 - David;: Rookie question but why would a credit check in and of itself damage a credit rating. Isn't that just standard procedure when applying for lots of things.
16/06/2020, 19:22 - David;: Lol, this
16/06/2020, 19:24 - David;: So what was the conclusion on watching footy, I should keep streaming illegally for the bargain price of £0 a month rising to £0 after 3 months and no £0 exit fees?
16/06/2020, 19:31 - Phill: An increased number of credit checks suggests a greater reliance on credit for things. Car insurance, paid monthly rather than upfront. Phone contracts, insurances paid monthly rather than upfront. Car payments rather than buying the car.
16/06/2020, 19:31 - Phill: More reliance on credit = higher risk to lenders
16/06/2020, 19:31 - Phill: Repeat applications for credit cards, loans etc
16/06/2020, 19:32 - Phill: All shows up on your grotty little report
16/06/2020, 19:33 - David;: Yeah makes sense for consumer credit, but e.g. for getting a mortgage. Everyone has one, it's all about the loan to equity ratio and relative to income. Seems mental to penalise for that.
16/06/2020, 19:34 - Paul;: You get peen’d on that as it effects your ability to repay each month
16/06/2020, 19:34 - Paul;: If you got huge loans coming out each month will offer you less money and have to put more down
16/06/2020, 19:34 - Phill: But if you have loads of consumer credit then you’re more at risk of not meeting your mortgage payments
16/06/2020, 19:35 - David;: I was told having a history of paying back credit on time is better than having no credit at all. Was told to put small amounts on my credit card even if don't need to so there is a repayment history.
16/06/2020, 19:35 - David;: Also seems mental
16/06/2020, 19:36 - / James Ball: Yeah I put everything on my CC and pay back in full every month
16/06/2020, 19:36 - / James Ball: Keeps the credit utilisation up
16/06/2020, 19:36 - / James Ball: But not too high obvs
16/06/2020, 19:38 - / James Ball: Shows you take credit but then repay it on time
16/06/2020, 19:42 - David;: That's fully insane
16/06/2020, 19:43 - David;: Regular reliance on debt seen as safer than no reliance
16/06/2020, 19:44 - David;: I was forced to get a credit card in the first place to get a hire car. Now forced to use it against my will. Never needed it yet hounded into the credit system
16/06/2020, 19:44 - Jack G;: Credit card is safer for big purchases due to charge back. No real money actually going out straight away
16/06/2020, 19:47 - Jack G;: Also there some level of insurance inhereted from the credit underwriting. A credit card is just a good thing to have in general if you’re sensible
16/06/2020, 19:49 - David;: I prefer a flan
16/06/2020, 19:50 - Jack G;: You could probably buy that flam from sainsburys with points accumulated on your credit card
16/06/2020, 19:50 - Jack G;: Flan*
16/06/2020, 19:51 - Paul;: Free flan
16/06/2020, 20:03 - Damian Rumble: I'm convinced credit is a scam. Totally ridiculous that never having to borrow money because you have spent more than you have should in any way impact future borrowing confidence. Having credit card is effectively banks trying to trick you into overspending so they can charge for borrowing more than you need when people should just really have a bit of self discipline and save up before paying for thing
16/06/2020, 20:06 - Damian Rumble: Insurance, cars, flights, phones, bills. I always pay for these upfront as often paying for them on finance comes to more in total, and as a result I save more money and it becomes easier to pay for larger things in bulk
16/06/2020, 20:08 - Damian Rumble: And when you think about it, its really socially regressive as well. People on poor incomes will be less likely to afford bigger purchases. Buying them on credit or finance inevitably paying more than those who are wealthier.
16/06/2020, 20:13 - Rob;: I got done by not having ever used credit, then having a series of hard credit checks while getting my house. It then hasn't yet updated that I have been paying off my mortgage
16/06/2020, 20:13 - Rob;: All bollocks. Fuck it
16/06/2020, 20:13 - Rob;: Can't even change phone contract
16/06/2020, 20:15 - Paul;: Rekt by the system
16/06/2020, 20:15 - Phill: Learn to play scrubs
16/06/2020, 20:15 - Rob;: Hopefully when they put the mortgage on the system it will build back up again
16/06/2020, 20:30 - Jack G;: My credit score got tanked after taking out a mortgage, dropped 300 points on Experian despite now paying less than what I was on rent
16/06/2020, 20:31 - Rob;: Built up much since?
16/06/2020, 20:34 - Jack G;: Yeah but quite slowly, about 10 points a month on average
16/06/2020, 20:37 - Jack G;: Big rain, big thunder
16/06/2020, 20:38 - / James Ball: mine's at 984 right now but that's because I've moved house and only just remembered to register for electoral role
16/06/2020, 20:39 - / James Ball: shall I register your phone, Rob and then charge you huge monthly interest to use it?

16/06/2020, 21:39 - Paul;: Oh no eastenders has run out of episodes....
17/06/2020, 11:55 - Sam;: BREAKING: Ryan Fraser has refused to extend his Bournemouth contract beyond the end of June.
17/06/2020, 12:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Rate him
17/06/2020, 12:02 - Hamish Sinclair: Scottish messi
17/06/2020, 12:03 - Hamish Sinclair: Hope liverpool snap him up and play him with the messi of the alps
17/06/2020, 12:06 - Rob;: Huge fantasy let down this season. But guess he had his head turned by the thought of a Bosman
17/06/2020, 12:06 - Rob;: Worst time for a Bosman in ages with all clubs' revenue being fucked?
17/06/2020, 12:09 - Hamish Sinclair: More clubs out for a deal though
17/06/2020, 12:11 - Rob;: And perhaps the bootleg Messi market will hold up
17/06/2020, 12:11 - Rob;: It's your real Messis who might miss out on the megabucks
17/06/2020, 12:34 - Sam;: BREAKING: Fantasy Football players left devastated by the news that Grant Hanley is injured for Fridays match.
17/06/2020, 12:39 - Sam;: Big sub clause in new 5 subs thing. Play can only be stopped three times to make them. Three stoppages each of course.
17/06/2020, 12:47 - Rob;: Good rule
17/06/2020, 12:48 - Rob;: I guess an exception would be made for an enforced change when the game has been stopped for an injury anyway?
17/06/2020, 12:49 - Rob;: So you can replace your player with a broken leg, but you can't just make two extra changes in stoppage time to waste time?
17/06/2020, 13:04 - Sam;: Hopefully they apply it very strictly so that broken leg guy has to crawl off the pitch
17/06/2020, 14:56 - Hamish Sinclair: Rob does ozil still play?

17/06/2020, 15:49 - David;: This is my thinking
17/06/2020, 15:50 - Phill: Sort the vouchers. Bash a few goals in.
17/06/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: I have no idea who Arteta will pick. There is no data
17/06/2020, 15:56 - David;: He's in
17/06/2020, 15:56 - David;: Blarcus blashford

17/06/2020, 17:45 - Paul;: It’s updated now. I can see the shit you’re fielding
17/06/2020, 17:45 - David;: Headline is that I've triple captained Aubameyang.
17/06/2020, 17:45 - David;: Stayed well clear of the City trickery that will suck everyone else in
17/06/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: Have a look at my team and try not to be intimidated
17/06/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: Try as hard as you can not to shit yourself

17/06/2020, 18:22 - David;: I can't wait to see foden brought in for sterling for no reason
17/06/2020, 18:24 - Sam;: I’ve seen Foden in way of the dragon (RW)..
17/06/2020, 18:24 - Sam;: But not time of the dragon (LW)
17/06/2020, 18:24 - Sam;: (Stirling is LW)
17/06/2020, 18:25 - David;: You'd have to say it loses something with no fans

17/06/2020, 18:36 - David;: Nah round at Fay's parents - full sky hd experience
17/06/2020, 18:36 - Sam;: You need to put it on the right channel for fan noise then
17/06/2020, 18:38 - David;: No I have noise just the physical absence of fans
17/06/2020, 18:39 - David;: This isn't the same spectacle. It's like getting methadone for a heroin addiction. It takes the edge off but not the same
17/06/2020, 18:39 - David;: Feels low stakes somehow
17/06/2020, 18:40 - Sam;: Nothing like like finding the vein on the under side of a bollock
17/06/2020, 18:42 - David;: I think it changes how teams play. Not bombing forward like headless chickens
17/06/2020, 18:42 - David;: That's key to the prems appeal
17/06/2020, 18:46 - Sam;: Hold on. Not over the line there?
17/06/2020, 18:46 - Sam;: Goal line tech ist kaput.
17/06/2020, 18:47 - David;: Do we get var for this?
17/06/2020, 18:48 - David;: How var are they planning to take it
17/06/2020, 18:48 - Sam;: Nothing in the rules as the goal line tech is supposed to be definitive
17/06/2020, 18:49 - David;: But does var feature at all?
17/06/2020, 18:49 - David;: Your offsides, your pennos
17/06/2020, 18:50 - Sam;: Oh, yeah VAR is in use
17/06/2020, 18:51 - David;: How is Stanley park social distancing? Squatting round the screens
17/06/2020, 18:51 - Sam;: Bunk beds
17/06/2020, 18:51 - Sam;: VAR stations stacked on top of each other
17/06/2020, 18:52 - Sam;: High rise VAR
17/06/2020, 19:06 - Sam;: So a uuuuge fuck up by the technology
17/06/2020, 19:06 - Sam;: VAR could have have overruled. Rules DO allow for that
17/06/2020, 19:11 - David;: Not a thriller
17/06/2020, 19:11 - David;: So why is goal line teccy not involved if VAR is active?
17/06/2020, 19:14 - Sam;: They are both active. Goal line tech failed. VAR didn’t overrule, when it could of.
17/06/2020, 19:17 - Paul;: BREAKING: MAN CITY lineup
17/06/2020, 19:17 - Paul;: DYOR
17/06/2020, 19:17 - David;: Lol Aguero benched.
17/06/2020, 19:17 - David;: Of course
17/06/2020, 19:18 - David;: Pepe on bench
17/06/2020, 19:19 - Sam;: Aguero gets benched quite often
17/06/2020, 19:19 - Sam;: Fake news
17/06/2020, 19:19 - Paul;: No trolling in the city line up
17/06/2020, 19:20 - David;: Aguero troll
17/06/2020, 19:23 - Sam;: 25% of agueros appearances this season have been as a sub. And has only played 22 matches.
17/06/2020, 19:26 - Sam;: Rob, is Pablo Mari a thing?
17/06/2020, 19:26 - Sam;: Can he do football?
17/06/2020, 19:28 - David;: The Nissan Nket key

17/06/2020, 19:33 - David;: City just can't be trusted
17/06/2020, 19:36 - Rob;: _Was_ playing him
17/06/2020, 19:36 - Rob;: He seemed ok by our very low standards
17/06/2020, 19:37 - Damian Rumble: Great. 5 out of my 6 city/arse players are starting
17/06/2020, 19:37 - David;: I don't believe a goal will ever be scored under these circumstances
17/06/2020, 19:38 - Damian Rumble: Otamendi the lone turd in the haystack
17/06/2020, 19:38 - David;: Classic. This is what happens when you out your faith in City
17/06/2020, 19:38 - David;: If you play with raw shit you will get shitty
17/06/2020, 19:39 - Jack G;: Paul, you appear to have fallen hard into the villa trap
17/06/2020, 19:40 - Paul;: Fake news Jack. Had grealish for ages
17/06/2020, 19:42 - Jack G;: No chance to taken him out with your unlimited transfers?
17/06/2020, 19:42 - Paul;: He’s on a doubler. Gets points. Learn to ff
17/06/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: Jaccckkkk, he's the 7th highest scoring midfielder and costs 2m less than any of the players ahead of him
17/06/2020, 19:44 - Damian Rumble: Villa have the worst run in by far though
17/06/2020, 19:45 - Damian Rumble: Basically relegated already
17/06/2020, 19:45 - Damian Rumble: Will be shipping after the double gw
17/06/2020, 19:45 - Jack G;: Yeah but buying in villa players because they have a double game week doesn’t seem worth it
17/06/2020, 19:45 - Jack G;: A trap
17/06/2020, 19:46 - Jack G;: And Sheffield have a strong defence
17/06/2020, 19:46 - Damian Rumble: Agreed. Grealish is the only one worth considering
17/06/2020, 19:55 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
17/06/2020, 19:56 - David;: >doing this
17/06/2020, 20:03 - David;: Such a greasy pitch
17/06/2020, 20:04 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah. I’m less than a mile from the etihad, big rain and thunder atm
17/06/2020, 20:10 - Jack G;: Apparently fans aren’t allowed in the stadium but I can’t tell any difference?
17/06/2020, 20:10 - David;: Hib
17/06/2020, 20:10 - Sam;: Loooool
17/06/2020, 20:10 - Phill: It’s not old Trafford jack
17/06/2020, 20:11 - Sam;: Highest average attendance?
17/06/2020, 20:11 - Sam;: Is that the stadium you’re trolling?
17/06/2020, 20:12 - Paul;: >time of the dragon
17/06/2020, 20:12 - David;: Lowest average colon control
17/06/2020, 20:12 - Phill: <Media omitted>
17/06/2020, 20:12 - Phill: >fans
17/06/2020, 20:13 - David;: The pitch is so greasy
17/06/2020, 20:13 - David;: Why has someone been smearing lard over it?
17/06/2020, 20:16 - Damian Rumble: The lack of the crowd really intensifies the sound of the rain
17/06/2020, 20:17 - Sam;: Rob. Explain why arsenal are not in red?
17/06/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: Probably just Addidas commercial reasons
17/06/2020, 20:19 - Sam;: GREAT
17/06/2020, 20:19 - David;: Ah Rob you seem to have  put a gazelle in defence
17/06/2020, 20:19 - David;: Not in control of his limbs
17/06/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: Perhaps too much white? But why not the yellow second kit, I don't know
17/06/2020, 20:23 - Jack G;: “Had a controlled meal”

17/06/2020, 20:39 - David;: Bringing on a replacement foal
17/06/2020, 20:41 - Rob;: They're really obsessed with the idea that planes shouldn't fly in rain
17/06/2020, 20:42 - Rob;: It's not a hurricane, Gary
17/06/2020, 20:45 - Phill: >we’re not really here
17/06/2020, 20:48 - Damian Rumble: I loved the shot of the subs. Hanging out in the stand looking miserable 2 m apart
17/06/2020, 20:49 - Sam;: I loved the shot of the corner flags. Looking misers 100m apart
17/06/2020, 20:52 - Jack G;: Got some blue sky appearing so second half should be less greasy
17/06/2020, 20:54 - David;: I'm twitching my ass on the bench here
17/06/2020, 20:57 - Damian Rumble: Not a fan of the artificial crowd noise. Bit like having the radio on but no station tuned in.
17/06/2020, 21:00 - David;: Drone > no drone
17/06/2020, 21:00 - David;: Drone represents drone
17/06/2020, 21:01 - Rob;: It's easier to ignore than the silence though. Silence becomes your entire being.
17/06/2020, 21:02 - David;: Yeah the silence games were unwatchable
17/06/2020, 21:03 - David;: Ah
17/06/2020, 21:03 - Damian Rumble: I found a stream with no drone. I quite like hearing the players communicating with each other during the game. Though the echo is not great
17/06/2020, 21:04 - Paul;: That would be a triple captain
17/06/2020, 21:04 - David;: Game needed that tbf
17/06/2020, 21:04 - Rob;: Luiz gonna luiz

17/06/2020, 21:08 - Sam;: It fits
17/06/2020, 21:08 - Sam;: I shits
17/06/2020, 21:10 - Rob;: Raw shit
17/06/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: Well at least he's gone now
17/06/2020, 21:25 - David;: Ah luiz
17/06/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: Is this not double jeopardy?
17/06/2020, 21:27 - Sam;: I was thinking that
17/06/2020, 21:28 - Sam;: Can you still get a red if it’s denial of a goal scoring opportunity?
17/06/2020, 21:29 - Rob;: I thought that was the point? That the penalty restores the goal scoring opportunity, so no need to double up the punishment with a sending off too
17/06/2020, 21:29 - Rob;: Fancy our chances without him now anyway
17/06/2020, 21:31 - Sam;: 🤷🏼‍♂️

17/06/2020, 21:53 - David;: You can get a lot done with them
17/06/2020, 21:55 - David;: Weird having the vibe and quality of a pre season friendly but actually a crunch end of season prem game
17/06/2020, 21:55 - David;: My bonce doesn't really know what it's watching
17/06/2020, 21:58 - Rob;: I'm listening to synthetic fans cheer on a medical incident
17/06/2020, 22:01 - Damian Rumble: Lol
17/06/2020, 22:03 - David;: You couldn't really get into it otherwise
17/06/2020, 22:03 - Paul;: Crowd clapping him off
17/06/2020, 22:03 - Paul;: Little arsenal chant going
17/06/2020, 22:14 - David;: Everyone looks shockingly unfit
17/06/2020, 22:53 - Sam;: David Luiz coming out grovelling for a contract extension in the interview
17/06/2020, 22:54 - Sam;: “I made the wrong decision in the last two months”
17/06/2020, 22:54 - Paul;: Is he?
17/06/2020, 22:54 - Paul;: Ah thanks David. Just the player we were looking for

18/06/2020, 07:59 - Rob;: Arteta's post match analysis is great:  I want to delete the game from the hard drive. A lot of things happened and there’s no point taking a lot of things from this game.

Just delete it, and start preparing for the game at Brighton.
18/06/2020, 10:22 - Sam;: They do, largely put it down being booze addled

18/06/2020, 13:41 - Damian Rumble: Definition - being as mentally handicapped as Dominic Raab
18/06/2020, 13:47 - Paul;: @447969894197 are you able to explain Arsenals defence? You always buy foals or rakishly thin male models. Are people aware this is not a good tactic?
18/06/2020, 14:06 - Rob;: I would guess it's the effect of the Europa League - suddenly became a much less appealing club just as our central defenders needed replacing. Have had to second for 3rd choice or worse transfer targets
18/06/2020, 14:07 - Rob;: Also, contract mismanagement means we've lost lots of good attackers and spent most of the budget replacing them, not defenders
18/06/2020, 14:07 - Rob;: Poor club management binder Gazidez and Kroenke, then wild throwing money at the problem more recently
18/06/2020, 14:08 - Paul;: It’s been like this for 10 years. When werse arse last in champ league?
18/06/2020, 14:10 - Rob;: 16/17. We were comparatively better then. Kos and Mertes were good enough

18/06/2020, 19:33 - Damian Rumble: That's not looking that healthy tbh
18/06/2020, 19:34 - / James Ball: What could be more healthy than 22 litres of bottles piss?
18/06/2020, 19:35 - Damian Rumble: Well usually piss is not opaque right...
18/06/2020, 19:38 - / James Ball: it's only a bit translucent
18/06/2020, 23:27 - Damian Rumble: Watching question time for the first time in months. Great watching the Tory trying to congratulate themselves for listening and acting on Marcus' advice extremely cringe worthy. It's that or just repeating that 'we are dealing with really difficult circumstances' as an explanation for being totally shit at your job
19/06/2020, 07:27 - Phill: Isn’t it interesting how every Tory is shit at their job? What are the chances of that?
19/06/2020, 09:41 - Damian Rumble: It's because they purged the competent one from the party last year
19/06/2020, 12:56 - / James Ball: coronavirus done then
19/06/2020, 12:56 - / James Ball: just level 3 now
19/06/2020, 12:56 - / James Ball: clearly time to reopen as the world's 3rd worst country behind USA and Brazil
19/06/2020, 13:04 - Damian Rumble: Level 3 where "gradual relaxation of restrictions" can occur... Begs the question what has been happening for the last few weeks
19/06/2020, 13:06 - / James Ball: the last few weeks was just the tories looking at the balance sheet and valuing that higher than everyone's health
19/06/2020, 13:06 - Damian Rumble: Bilbo ded
19/06/2020, 13:08 - / James Ball: I thought he was older than that
19/06/2020, 14:10 - Sam;: BREAKING: Guardiola confirms the Sane wants to leave.
19/06/2020, 14:59 - Paul;: Damo can you perform data analysis on goosebumps books please to see frequency of word. There’s got to be a sure formula of writing tat that sells
19/06/2020, 15:00 - Paul;: They seemed like the best books ever when younger but actually horse shit
19/06/2020, 15:01 - Phill: Lol how have you gone from a simple data mining exercise which essentially counts words, to complex AI that writes even the shittest of children’s literature?
19/06/2020, 15:03 - Paul;: You can then just change out monsters and places for new words and put roughly the same other words in. Should flow with a similar cadence. Profit
19/06/2020, 15:04 - Phill: So exactly the same plot, just different names/places?
19/06/2020, 15:04 - Paul;: Dunno. Might have to change some bits
19/06/2020, 15:04 - Paul;: Pretty foolproof though
19/06/2020, 15:05 - Phill: God of the Bongs, The Companionship of the Bong
19/06/2020, 15:05 - Stefan;: Can AI understand abstract concepts like plot structure and character development?
19/06/2020, 15:05 - / James Ball: "AI" can understand whatever you program it to understand
19/06/2020, 15:06 - Phill: Nerds might pretend it can, but currently it can’t.
19/06/2020, 15:06 - Stefan;: As a higher order concept divorced from any particular story
19/06/2020, 15:07 - / James Ball: AI currently just iteratively tries things and is "rewarded" or "punished" if it gets things right or wrong
19/06/2020, 15:07 - / James Ball: left long enough and given enough data it will be pretty complex
19/06/2020, 15:08 - Phill: AI is wholly objective in its learning so will never understand what subjectively good plots/stories/characters are
19/06/2020, 15:08 - Paul;: I’ll write the book just need some data driven steering on it. Fuck AI. Use goose to mine data
19/06/2020, 15:09 - Damian Rumble: Give me big enough data and I will move the earth
19/06/2020, 15:09 - Phill: Chill Elon
19/06/2020, 15:10 - Paul;: Well we need to analyse a stand-alone goosebumps. A goosebumps series and then the entire canon of goosebumps
19/06/2020, 15:10 - Paul;: 3 different data sets
19/06/2020, 15:10 - Damian Rumble: If you can find a source to get all of the goose bumps books into a text format of some kind then i can certainly give it a go
19/06/2020, 15:11 - Paul;: Yeet
19/06/2020, 15:11 - Sam;: It already is interesting though
19/06/2020, 15:11 - Phill: This will be the shittest experiment in history.

19/06/2020, 15:13 - Paul;: Given us the raw data
19/06/2020, 15:14 - Damian Rumble: That should probably do the trick. I have some holiday next week so I can have a look at it then
19/06/2020, 15:14 - Damian Rumble: will be back in chippy for a few days
19/06/2020, 15:14 - Paul;: Good good

19/06/2020, 15:17 - Paul;: Ok

19/06/2020, 21:12 - Phill: Roy Keane sounds like that pissed bloke in the pub
19/06/2020, 21:13 - Paul;: Sounds like an armchair footballer
19/06/2020, 21:13 - Phill: David de Gea the most overrated goalkeeper
19/06/2020, 21:14 - Phill: I fucking hate Roy Keane. Such a miserable cunt. They should just drown him in the Mersey. Not even that good a player.
19/06/2020, 21:14 - Phill: Oh I’m ard, tackle dangerously, get mad.

20/06/2020, 11:01 - Phill: Ket
20/06/2020, 11:01 - Sam;: Love Keano. Drove United to consistent success for a decade. He’s right on maguire and de gea on the goal.
20/06/2020, 11:03 - Phill: You’re only saying that cos you’re scared of him. He’s a piece of shit.
20/06/2020, 11:09 - Phill: The game last night actually felt like a real game at least
20/06/2020, 11:13 - Sam;: Lol. He was actually snarling. Genuinely fuming
20/06/2020, 11:14 - Phill: He was so mad he could barely get his words out
20/06/2020, 11:15 - Phill: Even Evra was taken aback by his anger
20/06/2020, 11:18 - Sam;: Don’t let them on the bus
20/06/2020, 11:46 - Sam;: Watching some good show on bbc one. Apparently it’s all about water buffalo now. Buffalo herd up in Scotland tasting like top grade beef
20/06/2020, 11:46 - Sam;: Mans cooking tail now
20/06/2020, 11:46 - David;: Struggling to just hold it together. Definitely not a man who should be broadcasting
20/06/2020, 11:47 - Phill: His gritty little hairstyle as well. Just looked like he’d smashed 5 pints of Stella.
20/06/2020, 11:48 - Sam;: Three month of no anger release for the man. Souness should be the same. Hasn’t been able to criticise pobga fur while
20/06/2020, 11:49 - Phill: Finally turned of predictive text
20/06/2020, 11:50 - Phill: “I think you meant gritty. Let me fix that for you”

20/06/2020, 15:15 - David;: Instantly more solid
20/06/2020, 15:42 - David;: Poor leno
20/06/2020, 15:53 - Paul;: How many injuries for arse now?
20/06/2020, 16:02 - Paul;: Keane is a bitter old has been

20/06/2020, 17:01 - Damian Rumble: Going to need to start selling those arsenal players
20/06/2020, 17:03 - David;: Not a great start
20/06/2020, 17:04 - Paul;: Let my Pepe go
20/06/2020, 17:05 - Paul;: Arsenal have as many points as they are points away from Liverpool
20/06/2020, 17:06 - Phill: Are they 10th now?

20/06/2020, 19:32 - Rob;: This is after I'd raked out most of the old mortar, except around the arches, which was cement. Had to angle grind that out
20/06/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
20/06/2020, 19:33 - Rob;: And that's what was under the plaster
20/06/2020, 19:36 - / James Ball: twin arches - was it originally a higher opening and then reduced do you think?
20/06/2020, 19:36 - Rob;: Yeah, think so
20/06/2020, 19:37 - Rob;: Predates cement above the original arch. Horse hair mortar
20/06/2020, 19:37 - / James Ball: or possibly it was a stove
20/06/2020, 19:37 - / James Ball: flat area above the first arch that got warm with a fire
20/06/2020, 19:38 - Rob;: Lower arch and bricks added to accommodate the old boiler I think, along with the infill
20/06/2020, 19:39 - / James Ball: ah reet. the old back boiler
20/06/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: Keeping the lower bit as i'm going to mount a TV on there so it will be covered anyway
20/06/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: And don't want to hurt my neck watching Bargain Hunt in 4K
20/06/2020, 19:40 - Phill: Dont mount a tv on it if youre actually going to put a burner in there
20/06/2020, 19:44 - Paul;: Why not?
20/06/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: I think it will probably be fine. I looked it up and TVs operate well up to about 45 Celsius. I'm probably going to heat the room to less than half that, so hopefully won't be that bad close too
20/06/2020, 19:51 - Sam;: Using central heating?
20/06/2020, 19:52 - Rob;: Using the burner i'd like to get

20/06/2020, 20:54 - Phill: Moist on the inside though.
20/06/2020, 20:55 - Phill: Medium.
20/06/2020, 20:55 - Phill: Theres a crispy potat hidden under all that
20/06/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: That’s fine. Just not having any crisp texture is how Sam would order salmon. The opposite of steak well done
20/06/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: Salmon. Boiled. Raw in the middle
20/06/2020, 20:56 - Phill: Hed have salmon cooked skin side up.
20/06/2020, 20:56 - Paul;: Nice slimy treat
20/06/2020, 20:56 - Sam;: Jokes on you as I wouldn’t bother with salmon

20/06/2020, 21:10 - Stefan;: I did a good one this week with lime soy sauce ginger chili marinade
20/06/2020, 21:10 - Stefan;: Fry in sesame oil

21/06/2020, 10:29 - Damian Rumble: "Here is the bad part: When you do testing to that extent, you are going to find more people, you will find more cases," [Trump] told the cheering crowd. "So I said 'slow the testing down'."
21/06/2020, 11:31 - / James Ball: If you don't look at it it will go away. I thought object persistence was something we learnt at around age 2 or 3?

22/06/2020, 16:15 - David;: This seems mental, like there will be a time when it's still not allowed to meet your parents or friends in their home but can meet them at a boozer.
22/06/2020, 16:16 - Rob;: Yeah. Economy first
22/06/2020, 16:17 - Rob;: You can meet your mum down the local dogging spot but not in the house

22/06/2020, 20:34 - Paul;: Vardy
22/06/2020, 20:34 - Paul;: Rashford
22/06/2020, 20:35 - Damian Rumble: Definitely thinking of Kane... But not enough data
22/06/2020, 20:36 - Phill: Tfw Arsenal finish in the bottom half of the table and Aubameyang leaves

22/06/2020, 20:38 - David;: The boy who lived

22/06/2020, 20:39 - David;: Lol, great

22/06/2020, 20:39 - Paul;: I’ll find it one second
22/06/2020, 20:39 - David;: Nketiah playing above him
22/06/2020, 20:40 - David;: The Nissan Nket key
22/06/2020, 20:40 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
22/06/2020, 20:40 - Paul;: Not playing him for fear of him scoring goals
22/06/2020, 20:40 - Paul;: Very arsenal
22/06/2020, 20:41 - Rob;: Nketiah two years older, and is promising too. Surprising either is playing really with Lacazatte, auba and Pepe
22/06/2020, 20:41 - Rob;: Lol, so baseless. Just Spaffing into the wind
22/06/2020, 20:42 - David;: Yeah this would be a classic arsenal scenario
22/06/2020, 20:43 - David;: Maybe, just watched the last 2 games and he looked completely ineffective
22/06/2020, 20:43 - David;: What sort of player is he in theory
22/06/2020, 20:43 - David;: If everything goes right for him
22/06/2020, 20:44 - Rob;: They all looked pretty shit to be fair
22/06/2020, 20:44 - Rob;: He's been an effective poacher in his best games
22/06/2020, 20:45 - Rob;: All-rounder rather than relying on one factor like pace or dribbling
22/06/2020, 20:45 - Paul;: It’ll be quite fun to be in the hustle and bustle of the championship for a season though? Bring back the fighting spirit vying for a playoff spot for promotion
22/06/2020, 20:45 - David;: His eggs always look great
22/06/2020, 20:46 - David;: Guendouzi is a player you can build around. Actually seems to want to do football rather than being forced into it at gunpoint
22/06/2020, 20:46 - Rob;: Yeah, just needs to learn to control games
22/06/2020, 20:46 - Rob;: But has potential
22/06/2020, 20:46 - David;: The right kind of foal
22/06/2020, 20:47 - David;: And in a position where it doesn't matter so much
22/06/2020, 20:48 - Damian Rumble: Aguero injured. Mahrez double. Loving life
22/06/2020, 20:48 - Paul;: What kind of player are arsenal going to sign in the summer. Give me names
22/06/2020, 20:48 - Rob;: Just need to get through this season really and put a long term plan over the next couple of transfer windows. Ship out some names and look for people who will come to the top of their came in the next couple of years to supplement the decent youth set up. Accept that we can't fix it quick and work on the basics
22/06/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: I haven't been reading much transfer stuff over lockdown
22/06/2020, 20:49 - David;: Wasn't Emery the long term plan?
22/06/2020, 20:50 - Rob;: Yeah, and we got it wrong
22/06/2020, 20:50 - Phill: Adil Aouchouche
22/06/2020, 20:51 - David;: Do you think they will trust arteta to oversee it
22/06/2020, 20:51 - Phill: Wissam Ben Yedder
22/06/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: I don't think they'd have appointed someone so unexperienced if they weren't prepared to give him time
22/06/2020, 20:51 - Paul;: You’ll be in the market for whispy thin players prone to injury who weigh around 8 stone
22/06/2020, 20:51 - David;: French if possible
22/06/2020, 20:52 - Phill: Theyll probably sign coutinho for £60m

22/06/2020, 20:52 - David;: Ah
22/06/2020, 20:53 - Rob;: Some big knee jerk signing that doesn't actually address the big problem like coutinho is exactly the sort of thing we'd try to be honest
22/06/2020, 20:53 - Rob;: Doubt he'd come
22/06/2020, 20:53 - Phill: <Media omitted>
22/06/2020, 20:54 - Phill: Like an arranged marriage
22/06/2020, 20:54 - David;: He'd be decent though. Does goals and passing
22/06/2020, 20:54 - Paul;: No one to pass to or set up goals
22/06/2020, 20:55 - Paul;: My huge football event is waiting for the release of the new boro kit and picking which player I’m going to get on the back
22/06/2020, 20:55 - David;: <Media omitted>
22/06/2020, 20:55 - Rob;: I really want to upgrade Xhaka more than anything else to be honest. Good teams have one of their best players in the middle. And we have an erratic yellow card generator.
22/06/2020, 20:56 - David;: Who also hates the fans
22/06/2020, 20:56 - Rob;: I miss being good at transfers

22/06/2020, 21:42 - David;: An issue?
22/06/2020, 21:43 - Rob;: Inevitable if you go back to normal life
22/06/2020, 21:46 - David;: But normal life was great
22/06/2020, 21:47 - Paul;: All about the glory of lockdown life
22/06/2020, 21:47 - Paul;: The new normal
22/06/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: Obviously I'm pleased, but I am surprised our numbers are still falling. Although our case numbers are sort of plateauing, but it's such a factor of testing it's hard to know what that means

23/06/2020, 19:41 - David;: Tastes exactly like rubicon

23/06/2020, 19:41 - Paul;: Which brand of tonic water?
23/06/2020, 19:42 - David;: Schweppes, chilled to death
23/06/2020, 19:43 - David;: Mix it up strong dont scrimp on the squash. They've somehow played a massive blinder with the flavour
23/06/2020, 19:44 - Paul;: Why is there no vardy party
23/06/2020, 19:46 - Paul;: 1 goal off a 100 goals this is prime fantasy pick. He should be fired up to get that
23/06/2020, 19:49 - Rob;: Can you not just buy Rubicon?

23/06/2020, 19:55 - David;: Sure if you enjoy pissing money up the drain
23/06/2020, 19:55 - David;: 'got a great trip for keeping warm - coal' 'can you not just burn banknotes?'
23/06/2020, 19:55 - Paul;: Or enjoy throwing money down the wall
23/06/2020, 19:56 - David;: Plus the packaging Rob. Enjoy killing the dolphins
23/06/2020, 19:57 - Rob;: But you're buying two bottles instead of one
23/06/2020, 19:58 - David;: But those two bottles are doing you the equivalent of 5-6 cans
23/06/2020, 19:58 - Paul;: 2L bottle of rubicon?
23/06/2020, 19:58 - Rob;: Cans are actually the most recycled material

23/06/2020, 20:04 - Rob;: I can't remember the last time I had it
23/06/2020, 20:04 - Paul;: Have you been on the generic rubicon page
23/06/2020, 20:04 - Rob;: I have about 1 soft drink a month

23/06/2020, 20:35 - Phill: But Rob hes brazilian
23/06/2020, 20:36 - Rob;: Saliba has been like that sub who never gets on in a dismal world cup campaign. Definitely the answer despite not having featured
23/06/2020, 20:37 - Rob;: Can't be registered for 19/20

24/06/2020, 15:45 - David;: Does anyone want to share a nowTV account until the end of the season to split costs
24/06/2020, 15:50 - Rob;: I'm already doing this with a mate from work, but to warn you, the standard definition version (£25) give you two screens at once, and HD (£28) gives you three. However they cheekily count a Chromecast as two at once
24/06/2020, 15:51 - David;: Lol amazing
24/06/2020, 15:51 - Rob;: So if you were planning on using a Chromecast, you would need an HD pass to split it 2 ways
24/06/2020, 15:52 - David;: I'm not planning on using chromecast. We are not a chromecast household
24/06/2020, 15:52 - David;: So you don't have another screen available on this account I take it
24/06/2020, 15:54 - Rob;: No, as I cast it uses them all up
24/06/2020, 15:55 - Rob;: Thought you were Mr Illegal Streams anyway
24/06/2020, 16:01 - Paul;: Why pay when you can stream for free he said
24/06/2020, 16:02 - Paul;: Who should come knocking
24/06/2020, 16:02 - Rob;: Bargain he said
24/06/2020, 16:02 - Paul;: Pointless paying he said
24/06/2020, 16:03 - Rob;: Won't stumpnup the cash for a Rubicon, but will line Rupert Murdoch's pockets
24/06/2020, 16:05 - Sam;: Oh David. A real stream of piss you are.
24/06/2020, 16:05 - Sam;: Exstreamly embarrassing
24/06/2020, 16:06 - Paul;: Crawling, begging and knocking he comes back to now tv
24/06/2020, 16:06 - Paul;: No room in the now tv inn
24/06/2020, 16:21 - David;: Happy streaming
24/06/2020, 16:21 - David;: But all the money saved on rubicon is burning a hole in the old pocket

24/06/2020, 17:56 - Damian Rumble: Also this hate for chromcast. I feel we need an explanation for this.
24/06/2020, 17:56 - Sam;: Fear
24/06/2020, 18:11 - David;: It serves no purpose
24/06/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: Can put something onto the tv with no cables needed.
24/06/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: Phone to tv
24/06/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: Laptop to tv

24/06/2020, 20:04 - Rob;: No one else in the Jules Chippet
24/06/2020, 20:04 - Rob;: A few have the boy Rashfood, who to be fair to the lad has done himself a few points
24/06/2020, 20:15 - Sam;: YNWA embarrassing without fans singing along with it. Like your nan refusing to turn her songs off cos the footies started
24/06/2020, 20:15 - Sam;: Shut up nan
24/06/2020, 20:15 - Rob;: It is mental the football fans heard that at a musical and thought, this could be huge
24/06/2020, 20:17 - Rob;: Are they playing the Gerry and the Pacemakers version?
24/06/2020, 20:17 - Sam;: Yeah
24/06/2020, 20:18 - Sam;: Even lowered the sound for the last YNWA where the fans would sing it
24/06/2020, 20:21 - Damian Rumble: Fernandes missing in action sigh
24/06/2020, 20:32 - David;: Lol yeah almost rubbing it in
24/06/2020, 21:29 - Rob;: A Nazi salute is the only thing Wayne Hennessy can get his arms up in time for

24/06/2020, 22:58 - Stefan;: This is excellent
24/06/2020, 22:58 - Stefan;: A++ Brain-Bott content
24/06/2020, 22:59 - / James Ball: She posted something about culling her Facebook friends earlier so it may be one of the last insights we get
24/06/2020, 23:09 - Hamish Sinclair: Even sweeter if you actually make the cut
24/06/2020, 23:17 - Paul;: Just saw the goose and we have well laid plans for harvesting goosebumps data
24/06/2020, 23:50 - David;: Someone needs to instantly send a new friend request. Ratchet up the stakes

25/06/2020, 13:07 - Rob;: There is no context I can provide
25/06/2020, 13:24 - Paul;: Do Liverpool win if they win one more game?
25/06/2020, 13:24 - Sam;: If city draw or loose tonight they win
25/06/2020, 13:25 - Paul;: I for one am looking forward to the arsenal game
25/06/2020, 13:25 - Sam;: The real highlight

25/06/2020, 15:42 - Phill: >other people
25/06/2020, 15:42 - Phill: Ive realised during lockdown how much i despise the masses.
25/06/2020, 15:43 - Rob;: About 0.7% of people gone down to Bournemouth today
25/06/2020, 15:44 - Rob;: Day at the beach = major incident these days
25/06/2020, 15:44 - Phill: I enjoy coordinated crowding, for a reason, such as glasto, footy etc
25/06/2020, 15:45 - Paul;: Nothing worse than being at the beach today
25/06/2020, 15:45 - Phill: But people just congregating like Fucking moths around water grinds my gears
25/06/2020, 15:46 - Paul;: All those Steve and Karen’s
25/06/2020, 15:46 - Rob;: I think the hottesr day of the year is one of the worst beach days
25/06/2020, 15:46 - Rob;: No shade
25/06/2020, 15:46 - Phill: All the steve karen going to durdle door from wolverhampton with their low IQ offspring leaving litter and empty cans everywhere. Fucking die....
25/06/2020, 15:47 - Paul;: A disposable Lidl bbq
25/06/2020, 15:47 - Phill: Minster Lovell. I mean come on... that many people there? Bathing in warm fluvial water?
25/06/2020, 15:48 - Phill: River water for fucks sake.

25/06/2020, 15:48 - Phill: A punctured lilo, drooping half inflated from an overfilled bin.
25/06/2020, 15:54 - Paul;: What do they do about it?
25/06/2020, 15:55 - Paul;: All the socialists getting purged from labour
25/06/2020, 15:55 - Rob;: Additional police, dispersal orders
25/06/2020, 15:55 - Paul;: Hopefully they start a new party
25/06/2020, 15:55 - Paul;: Keep them isolated
25/06/2020, 16:02 - Damian Rumble: My momentum card carrying housemate was bitterly disappointed RLB didn't win the labour leadership. She'll be furious at this set back for sure. She confidently predicted the party would split in the next couple of years.
25/06/2020, 16:02 - / James Ball: I'm with Phil people ruin everything
25/06/2020, 17:21 - Rob;: I can see why Keir Starmer wants to be very tough on anti-Semitism and get it over with as a criticism of labour, but it's quite a tenuous instance
25/06/2020, 17:23 - Rob;: Long-Baily retweeted and interview in The Independent with actress Maxine Peak, who in one line says something about the Israeli police
25/06/2020, 17:23 - Rob;: https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/maxine-peake-interview-labour-corbyn-keir-starmer-black-lives-matter-a9583206.html
25/06/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
25/06/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: That's a very tough line to take.
25/06/2020, 17:28 - Sam;: It is a conspiracy theory though
25/06/2020, 17:34 - Stefan;: I think calling it a conspiracy theory is a stretch. We know the Israeli security services did hold a training conference with Minneapolis police in 2012, and that Israeli forces have been documented using the knee on neck restraint in Palestine.
25/06/2020, 17:35 - Stefan;: Concluding that the Minneapolis police learned the specific technique from them is an assumption or inference, but doesn't seem conspiratorial to me
25/06/2020, 17:38 - Stefan;: That said, I can see how it would appeal to people who buy into conspiratorial thinking about Israel, so it's not great
25/06/2020, 17:38 - Rob;: I think people should be able to share an article without it therefore being assumed you agree with everything in it and that's now official policy. Seems like everyone will get fired that way
25/06/2020, 17:38 - Sam;: It is an assumption/inference though
25/06/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: I once read something printed in Gill Sans. Am I a paedophile now?
25/06/2020, 17:39 - Sam;: Yes
25/06/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: Ah ok
25/06/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: Fair enough.
25/06/2020, 17:39 - Rob;: As long as the rules are clear I am fine with ir
25/06/2020, 17:39 - Sam;: Whose Gill Sans?
25/06/2020, 17:40 - Rob;: Eric Gill designed a sans serif font called Gill Sans. It was and to some extent is still very popular
25/06/2020, 17:41 - Rob;: He kept diaries about fucking his daughters and some people went off using it
25/06/2020, 17:42 - Phill: But why else have daughters?
25/06/2020, 17:42 - Rob;: Many Penguin books use it
25/06/2020, 17:42 - Rob;: Well, exactly
25/06/2020, 17:43 - Sam;: >diaries
25/06/2020, 17:44 - Sam;: Dear diary, shagged my daughter. AGAIN lol.
25/06/2020, 17:45 - Stefan;: Lmao imagine thinking it's a great idea to write about all the times you fucked your daughters in a book with your name on it
25/06/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: Goes into A LOT of detail
25/06/2020, 17:47 - Hamish Sinclair: Ah yeah Kate worked at the ditchling museum that displays all his work
25/06/2020, 17:47 - Hamish Sinclair: They got really fucked cos their entire collection is his sculptures but then he was exposed as a pedo
25/06/2020, 18:07 - Damian Rumble: Tbh it doesn't really matter how tenuous the link to anti semitism is. It's all about the image of the party and the politics. Starmer said rooting out anti-Semitism was his number one priority and needs to set an example with breaches that condition first. RLB was unlucky that she was that first person but she shouldn't be surprised by the outcome
25/06/2020, 18:08 - Paul;: Time to watch arsenal get cucked by Southampton
25/06/2020, 18:29 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/06/2020, 18:30 - Phill: Dat icy G&T
25/06/2020, 18:52 - David;: This. It's a point about the close links between US and Israeli security services which is well documented. It does not fall under the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism which is what Jewish groups recommend: 'Manifestations include the targeting of the state of Israel, conceived as a Jewish collectivity. However, criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic'. No link has been drawn here between Israeli security forces and Jews in general.
25/06/2020, 19:58 - Sam;: Ok fine. Guardiola is a troll. No aguero, benches Jesus.

26/06/2020, 18:24 - Rob;: Very slightly more than this day last week, which isn't great. 7 day average is staying the same or going up
26/06/2020, 18:24 - David;: Can't think of anything I would rather spend the money on
26/06/2020, 18:26 - Rob;: Good to take back control of our borders in a very literal cartographical way
26/06/2020, 18:27 - David;: I just love duplicating large scale infrastructure. I have economies of scale.

26/06/2020, 19:29 - / James Ball: The original GPS system is old and failing. It's satellites will probably all stop functioning in the next couple of decades. Luckily there are already various other systems up and running including one led by the ESA which we are leaving due to Brexit.
26/06/2020, 19:30 - / James Ball: So long story short, we already were paying for a GPS replacement and it's almost done but now we're going to start a new one because of Brexit
26/06/2020, 19:30 - David;: Galileo
26/06/2020, 19:31 - David;: Yeah that's what I meant. We are now paying to replace the replacement
26/06/2020, 19:31 - David;: Not getting the money invested into Galileo back either
26/06/2020, 19:31 - / James Ball: Some old GPS devices from the 90s don't work now because the satellites they look for are ded

27/06/2020, 17:34 - David;: "In the study, 52 percent said that coffee only made them have a bowel movement in the morning. Similarly, 58 percent said that coffee only had this effect if they hadn't defecated yet that day. Those who were "moved" by coffee said that there was a span of about 20 minutes between drinking coffee and visiting the toilet. In a 2005 study, measurements indicated that coffee triggered a reaction in the colon within 30 minutes of coffee intake"
27/06/2020, 17:36 - David;: "The main documented reason for coffee making people defecate has to do with a reaction in the distal colon, which is located at the end of the colon.1﻿ The reasons for this are not well understood but scientists speculate that it is due to the hormonal effects of the exorphins in coffee (which bind to opiate receptors that slow down or speed up your gut) and two naturally occurring chemicals in coffee called gastrin and cholecystokinin. These chemicals are absorbed into the blood and directed to the brain and colon. They may stimulate muscle contractions in the lower colon, thus promoting bowel movements in the 20 minutes after coffee is consumed."

27/06/2020, 17:43 - Rob;: 99 participants. Quite a small study
27/06/2020, 17:44 - Rob;: Unexpected that decaffeinated is worse
27/06/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: Does this say decaf causes more shit
27/06/2020, 17:44 - Paul;: I suppose caffeine in Coca Cola and not shitting after that
27/06/2020, 17:45 - Paul;: So strip away the caffeine which might be suppressing and then raw shit flows harder
27/06/2020, 17:45 - Rob;: Seems counterintuitive though, caffeine thought to prompt peristalsis - bowel movements
27/06/2020, 17:46 - Stefan;: Lol "when questioned, six subjects felt they could defecate if required"
27/06/2020, 17:47 - Paul;: Dave you should write into the study stating your “desire” to instantly dedicate. Not seen in the study

27/06/2020, 20:15 - / James Ball: I would hazard that pissing and shitting are the most common toilet activities yes
27/06/2020, 20:15 - Paul;: The data points that way. 59% of women on the anal verge after coffee
27/06/2020, 20:16 - Paul;: Dat 12cm verge long shart event

27/06/2020, 20:19 - / James Ball: Unlike their sharts
27/06/2020, 20:19 - Paul;: More often than not it’s grotty instant shitting

27/06/2020, 20:19 - / James Ball: Yeah, I'd wager it's a sit down, coat the bowl and get up again all within 3 mins job

27/06/2020, 22:34 - Stefan;: Great news
27/06/2020, 23:08 - David;: just thought of a new mad strategy for taking free kicks. Rather than the one player running then stepping over leaving it for the other. Both players start running full pelt towards the ball at the same time from different sides and one stops just in front leaving it for the other.
27/06/2020, 23:08 - David;: So 2 run ups happening simultaneously
27/06/2020, 23:17 - Paul;: A 100m run up though to get some pace behind it?
27/06/2020, 23:29 - David;: Or 4 people running at it from the 4 compass points
27/06/2020, 23:30 - Rob;: What so two people could clear it?
27/06/2020, 23:31 - David;: Yeah, every so often they do have to hit it and waste the free kick to develop the element of surprise
27/06/2020, 23:31 - Rob;: Could become a defensive situation
27/06/2020, 23:32 - David;: Yeah, but the uncertaintly and panic you're introducing to the situation makes it worth it, you'll score more goals but sometimes you'll concede
27/06/2020, 23:34 - David;: How far can you take the running up and stepping over thing? If you go through the whole squad before someone hits it
27/06/2020, 23:34 - David;: Where in the rules is that forbidden
27/06/2020, 23:36 - Rob;: Even your keeper, sprinting to do a step over then get back
27/06/2020, 23:44 - David;: Do it with throw ins, 4 people standing outside the line, juggling it to each other you never know which one is going to suddenly throw it
27/06/2020, 23:45 - David;: Could you do a throw in standing on the shoulders of a team mate to get extra height and a steep angle down
27/06/2020, 23:46 - Rob;: So Stoke back in the day would have three shit throwers and one Delap, and that's worse than just Delap because the shit throw in could catch you off your guard?
27/06/2020, 23:47 - David;: Yeah because they are all running around throwing it to each other, running up to the line then pulling back. You never know when the throw will come
27/06/2020, 23:48 - Rob;: outcome: 'there will be a minimum of 14 minutes added time'
27/06/2020, 23:49 - David;: that's fine, you're 4-0 up by then from all the dangerous throws
27/06/2020, 23:49 - Rob;: I'm onboard
27/06/2020, 23:49 - Rob;: Drop balls should come back
27/06/2020, 23:49 - Rob;: But the ref boots it in the air, as vertical and high as possible, and the whole team has to contest it
28/06/2020, 09:27 - Rob;: Well if Robert Jenrick can approve 1bn housing development in return for a bribe without losing his job, then the government can't complain about everyone else doing it now. Another part of lockdown gone.

29/06/2020, 22:50 - David;: When population adjusted
30/06/2020, 00:27 - Damian Rumble: It's hard to put the finger on exactly why we fucked it up. The health system didn't collapse like Italy. We didn't have a leader telling people to go on to the streets and protest the lock down like the USA. We did attempt to lockdown, unlike Sweden. We pushed infected old people into care homes, but then so did France as far as I understand. Or was it simply that we have a high population density economy that was heavily dependent on services and with several global transport hubs, in which case we were fucked from the start.

30/06/2020, 14:12 - / James Ball: okay with hugs & high-fives and french kissing
30/06/2020, 15:03 - David;: Massive
30/06/2020, 15:03 - David;: I will be investing
30/06/2020, 15:04 - Phill: Ball development would be a great little job
30/06/2020, 15:07 - Paul;: That ball just makes things shit?
30/06/2020, 15:32 - / James Ball: One could argue it is partly my job already
30/06/2020, 15:37 - Hamish Sinclair: Ball ball develops ball
30/06/2020, 15:55 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
30/06/2020, 16:14 - Damian Rumble: Fucking SaaS. Such an awful product
30/06/2020, 16:31 - David;: Surely should have called it 'top flight' as it's being used in the prem. That's been bugging me.
30/06/2020, 16:31 - David;: Just flight - to miss that reference.
30/06/2020, 16:32 - Sam;: Think they go for a generic name for selling it globally
30/06/2020, 16:33 - Sam;: Wa ya meeean? Saas is a method of product delivery. Not a product
30/06/2020, 16:35 - Damian Rumble: Saas enterprise is a coding langauge. I really bad/expensive one
30/06/2020, 16:36 - Phill: I thought it stood for Software as a Service?
30/06/2020, 16:37 - Sam;: It does when written as in her profile. SaaS.
30/06/2020, 16:42 - David;: <Media omitted>
30/06/2020, 16:42 - David;: Lol this, bringing back the bullshit of the roundest ball ever. Also that it took 8 years to develop past that.
30/06/2020, 16:43 - David;: 'how do we make this ball less round?'
30/06/2020, 16:43 - David;: As long as the Apollo programme for that
30/06/2020, 19:50 - Sam;: Newcastle have let Pardews 8 year contract expire today
30/06/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: I would love to know their thinking there. The idea that it was more likely someone would come in for him than he would be sacked
30/06/2020, 19:55 - Sam;: Hands off Pardew
30/06/2020, 20:12 - Jack G;: Are Man U still paying for Moyes’ contract or is that done now?
30/06/2020, 20:13 - Sam;: Don’t be distracted by something like that Jack. Concentrate on your relegation battle.
30/06/2020, 20:14 - Jack G;: It’s fine, it’s not my first rodeo. In Moyes we trust
30/06/2020, 20:18 - Rob;: Do they do it like that, stagger your severance like a salary?
30/06/2020, 20:18 - Rob;: Rather than a big bump of bunce
30/06/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: Parsee could be getting paid by a lot of clubs at once
30/06/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: *pardew
30/06/2020, 20:20 - Jack G;: Was there not a clause that they stop paying his salary if he gets another job? Otherwise terrible lawyers
30/06/2020, 20:29 - Sam;: Liverpool win the COVID Cup. Worst win ever. No PEADOPOOL Parade.
30/06/2020, 20:30 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
30/06/2020, 20:58 - Sam;: Did you get anyone to go in on now tv Dave? Try putting a request on sparewanker.com
30/06/2020, 21:01 - David;: So better to get sacked constantly actually. Get paid more overall
30/06/2020, 21:02 - David;: 😂
30/06/2020, 21:06 - David;: Would be good if managers could see out their contracts like players and not get sacked. Refuse to manage the team, don't come to the games, make shit subs and formations deliberately.
30/06/2020, 21:06 - David;: If you could have the managerial equivalent of jack rodwell
30/06/2020, 21:06 - Hamish Sinclair: Training the reserves
30/06/2020, 21:08 - Rob;: Mourinho basically just turns himself to shit in his third season everywhere to get a payout. Good enough not to be out of the job for too long
30/06/2020, 21:28 - Rob;: Fernandes is a bit annoyingly good.
30/06/2020, 21:29 - Paul;: Damo only person with fernandes
30/06/2020, 21:29 - David;: Seems to do football
30/06/2020, 21:29 - Rob;: Very cute
30/06/2020, 21:32 - David;: I fancy him
30/06/2020, 21:32 - Phill: <Media omitted>
30/06/2020, 21:33 - Phill: He should join Liverpool.
30/06/2020, 21:33 - Phill: Move to a big club.
30/06/2020, 21:34 - Damian Rumble: Yaaas
30/06/2020, 21:34 - Phill: Hes too good to be at a mid table club with no ambition
30/06/2020, 21:34 - Damian Rumble: Only on weeks when I don't captain him
30/06/2020, 21:34 - Sam;: He’s not at Arsenal?
30/06/2020, 21:36 - Jack G;: United actually pretty good for once to be fair. No longer putting shit in bin
30/06/2020, 21:38 - Phill: <Media omitted>
01/07/2020, 15:50 - Paul;: Wigan ded
01/07/2020, 15:56 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
01/07/2020, 15:57 - Rob;: I know what you mean, but I sort of like it
01/07/2020, 15:57 - Paul;: sambo, you like the boring kits. Black boots or nothing etc
01/07/2020, 15:57 - Sam;: Yeah, not shit. Just plain.
01/07/2020, 15:58 - Paul;: steak well done
01/07/2020, 15:58 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
01/07/2020, 15:58 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
01/07/2020, 15:59 - Sam;: Ah
01/07/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: lol
01/07/2020, 15:59 - Paul;: what's the thought behind that?
01/07/2020, 15:59 - Sam;: All white could be interesting. Very different
01/07/2020, 15:59 - Sam;: No bloody scratches though please
01/07/2020, 16:18 - Rob;: Perhaps there's just really strong evidence that shit novelty kits sell very well
01/07/2020, 16:19 - Rob;: It's our local rival's shirt colour and it's seems to imply we're murderers
01/07/2020, 16:20 - Rob;: Also, practically not a big difference from our home kit, which we sometimes can't wear when away because of the amount of white on the arms and shorts
01/07/2020, 16:25 - Rob;: Like, if we can't wear the home kit due to a white clash, we can't wear that
01/07/2020, 16:44 - Sam;: Daym
01/07/2020, 18:05 - Damian Rumble: I actually quite like that. Looks a bit like marble
01/07/2020, 18:06 - Paul;: you also like Joker
01/07/2020, 18:09 - Rob;: You also like Live Burial
01/07/2020, 18:11 - Phill: You also like autism disc
01/07/2020, 18:14 - Damian Rumble: Don't forget Lewis Hamilton kart (starting up again this weekend btw)
01/07/2020, 18:14 - Phill: Ah yeah, hamilton chase
01/07/2020, 18:15 - Phill: Love that F1 decided to make a black car rather than hire more BAME people to show how diverse they are
01/07/2020, 18:15 - Phill: Maclaren even
01/07/2020, 18:15 - Phill: Or mercedes.
01/07/2020, 18:15 - Phill: One of them. Theyre generally all the same anyway.
01/07/2020, 18:21 - Rob;: Comically huge crowd noise for a tame Aubameyang header straight at the keeper just now
01/07/2020, 18:21 - David;: Like that
01/07/2020, 18:22 - Rob;: They thought that was in. They were sure it had trickled straight through the keeper's hands and chest
01/07/2020, 18:22 - David;: This is a piece of shit
01/07/2020, 18:23 - David;: Does it have a name a la the bruised banana
01/07/2020, 18:24 - Rob;: It's called the bollock soup
01/07/2020, 18:25 - Rob;: Marcos Alonso will love the sponsor. Just has his number on his chest as well
01/07/2020, 18:26 - David;: Lol. If there was a company called 10 that sponsored Barcelona the Messi version of that would be huge
01/07/2020, 18:26 - David;: Redesign their logo to also match the font
01/07/2020, 18:27 - Rob;: Really like a more graphic logo on a shirt
01/07/2020, 18:27 - Rob;: Loved it on the O2 eara
01/07/2020, 18:27 - Rob;: And SEGA away kit too
01/07/2020, 18:27 - David;: Yeah. E.g. the Dreamcast kits from early 2000s
01/07/2020, 18:28 - Rob;: Give me short, stylised words or single letters
01/07/2020, 18:28 - Rob;: No word and just a logo would be good
01/07/2020, 18:29 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
01/07/2020, 18:29 - Rob;: So small and recessive too. Like even Wang are embarrassed
01/07/2020, 18:31 - Phill: Thats a great fucking kit.
01/07/2020, 18:31 - Phill: Witney Vikings esque.
01/07/2020, 19:11 - David;: Howe do you recover from this?
01/07/2020, 19:14 - Rob;: Always hear Iheanacho as Iain Nacho
01/07/2020, 19:15 - Rob;: Like the opposite of Paul hearing Troy Deaney as an Italian called Troidini
01/07/2020, 19:17 - David;: Um hello
01/07/2020, 19:17 - David;: Saint-Maximin
01/07/2020, 19:17 - David;: A hat trick of assists
01/07/2020, 19:24 - Rob;: Got him in ready for next week
01/07/2020, 19:27 - David;: Nah
01/07/2020, 19:28 - David;: You weren't there at the beginning
01/07/2020, 19:28 - Rob;: Did it last night. The form and the price are right
01/07/2020, 19:28 - David;: You're not allowed him
01/07/2020, 19:34 - Damian Rumble: Knew the moment I dropped out of form aubayang he would come good. You're welcome boys
01/07/2020, 19:36 - Paul;: Ff over all my captaincy and transfers have turned to shit
01/07/2020, 19:39 - David;: Big plans for next year?
01/07/2020, 19:39 - Paul;: Needs a lengthy strategy rethink
01/07/2020, 19:39 - David;: How will you manage to not be a piece of shit
01/07/2020, 19:39 - Paul;: I’ve failed on captaincy a lot
01/07/2020, 19:40 - David;: Yeah captaincy trolls
01/07/2020, 19:40 - Paul;: Which players are actually good. That’s the first problem
01/07/2020, 19:40 - David;: Well not City. I refuse to engage with City
01/07/2020, 19:40 - Paul;: Sam feeds me poor information. Rob has no information
01/07/2020, 19:40 - David;: You can't live with City and you can't live without them
01/07/2020, 19:41 - Paul;: Jack will always provide 1/10 information
01/07/2020, 19:41 - David;: Fernandez flash in the pan. Predict a trending back to pedophilia
01/07/2020, 19:43 - David;: I can build around Saint-Maximin
01/07/2020, 19:43 - Paul;: I will be building a team around trossard next season
01/07/2020, 19:43 - David;: Ah.
01/07/2020, 19:43 - David;: That's a controversial and some would say insane statement
01/07/2020, 19:43 - David;: Do rate him however. Can see the logic
01/07/2020, 19:43 - Paul;: He’s overlooked. He’s brilliant
01/07/2020, 19:44 - Paul;: Surprised if he doesn’t go to Barca or someone
01/07/2020, 19:44 - David;: Do you remember the run on Che Adams bonds
01/07/2020, 19:44 - David;: The che Adams hype was huge
01/07/2020, 19:45 - Paul;: Not sure I engaged
01/07/2020, 19:45 - Paul;: Foden
01/07/2020, 19:47 - David;: Che Adams were all the forums were talking about
01/07/2020, 19:47 - David;: Also Djenepo mania
01/07/2020, 19:48 - David;: Jack what's happened to young Haller
01/07/2020, 19:48 - David;: Surely he just needed a year to bed in
01/07/2020, 19:49 - Paul;: Jacks 1/10 information. Haller being touted. Utter shit
01/07/2020, 19:51 - David;: Need to get deep into Leeds
01/07/2020, 19:51 - David;: Leeds being back is huge
01/07/2020, 19:55 - Rob;: Seeing my mate who's a huge, huge fan tomorrow night. I'll grill
01/07/2020, 19:56 - Rob;: Having Bielsa in the league is going to be great
01/07/2020, 19:58 - David;: Champions league semi finalists
01/07/2020, 19:59 - David;: Ask him about jack harrison
01/07/2020, 20:03 - David;: Lol Moyes. Forgotten about him
01/07/2020, 20:05 - Paul;: How good is this Leeds manager?
01/07/2020, 20:06 - Paul;: Has he got a good set of bollocks on him?
01/07/2020, 20:09 - Rob;: Yeah huge bollocks
01/07/2020, 20:09 - David;: Managed argentina
01/07/2020, 20:11 - David;: Has generally been a hilarious figure wherever he goes
01/07/2020, 20:12 - Paul;: You need a good set of bollocks
01/07/2020, 20:13 - David;: https://youtu.be/6_uqbcSslSM
01/07/2020, 20:16 - Phill: Yeah bielsa great
01/07/2020, 20:17 - Phill: Got a scout to hide in a bush at an opponents training ground before a playoff game
01/07/2020, 20:17 - Phill: Got caught
01/07/2020, 20:17 - Phill: Admitted it
01/07/2020, 20:17 - Phill: Didnt give a fuck
01/07/2020, 20:26 - Damian Rumble: How much time is there between this season ending and the next beginning? Presumably not a lot? Will make it a lot easier to pick a team from players who are in form
01/07/2020, 20:27 - Sam;: October start for the new season. August and September for transfer window
01/07/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: I really doubt form will carry over like that.
01/07/2020, 20:28 - Damian Rumble: Ah that's still quite a big gap
01/07/2020, 20:29 - Damian Rumble: 'cough' Leicester 'cough' season they became champions
01/07/2020, 20:31 - Rob;: I meant individual players
01/07/2020, 20:52 - Sam;: Fucking VAR.
01/07/2020, 20:53 - Sam;: This message was deleted
01/07/2020, 20:56 - Jack G;: Bullshit, complete VARce
01/07/2020, 20:58 - Jack G;: Of course they then go and score.
01/07/2020, 20:58 - Jack G;: Fuming
01/07/2020, 20:59 - David;: Lol
01/07/2020, 20:59 - David;: Yeah that's bullshite
01/07/2020, 21:00 - David;: Hate var love football
01/07/2020, 21:00 - Paul;: Watching some Spanish game yesterday. Took 8mins on a var decision that was wrong anyway
01/07/2020, 21:00 - Paul;: Refs are fucking stupid
01/07/2020, 21:00 - David;: West hams biggest problem however has been their shirt
01/07/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: Lol
01/07/2020, 21:01 - David;: Lol. And this is progress
01/07/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: Is a horrible shirt
01/07/2020, 21:01 - Paul;: Colour of shit mixed with blood
01/07/2020, 21:02 - David;: Top/bottom split is always rank
01/07/2020, 21:02 - Paul;: Couldn’t support them due to kit weakness
01/07/2020, 21:02 - Sam;: Same corner almost!
01/07/2020, 21:02 - David;: Get through the season get a new shirt
01/07/2020, 21:03 - Paul;: Mighty boro pull out a good shirt. Will be breaking it out tomorrow for the big game
01/07/2020, 21:04 - David;: >still pumping out bubbles to an empty stadium
01/07/2020, 21:04 - David;: Adds an air of tragedy
01/07/2020, 21:04 - David;: And playing the music
01/07/2020, 21:04 - Rob;: Yeah it's very weird
01/07/2020, 21:04 - Rob;: Big paedo vibes
01/07/2020, 21:04 - David;: You'll be happy with that Jack?
01/07/2020, 21:05 - Paul;: West Ham huge peado club?
01/07/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: Obviously
01/07/2020, 21:05 - Paul;: The child catchers
01/07/2020, 21:05 - Rob;: _forever_ blowing bubbles
01/07/2020, 21:06 - Paul;: Very IT
01/07/2020, 21:07 - David;: You've always been the bubble caretaker Jack
01/07/2020, 21:11 - David;: That VAR is fucking ridiculous
01/07/2020, 21:11 - Jack G;: Yep
01/07/2020, 21:11 - Jack G;: No idea what the official was thinking
01/07/2020, 21:12 - David;: Can we just chalk VAR off with coronavirus and forget all about it
01/07/2020, 21:12 - David;: A clean slate
01/07/2020, 21:14 - Phill: My Grandfather smoked his whole life. I was about 10 years old when my mother said to him, 'If you ever want to see your grandchildren graduate, you have to stop immediately.'. Tears welled up in his eyes when he realized what exactly was at stake. He gave it up immediately. Three years later he died of lung cancer. It was really sad and destroyed me. My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through." I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette. I must say, I feel a very slight sense of regret for never having done it, because VAR gave me cancer anyway.
01/07/2020, 21:14 - Sam;: The annoying thing is that don’t go by the mantra that they were saying that it will remove. CLEAR AND OBVIOUS ERROR
01/07/2020, 21:15 - David;: They've never applied it with any consistency either way or even bother to pretend there are clear principles any more
01/07/2020, 21:16 - David;: Surely if you're not sure fuck off and leave be
01/07/2020, 21:17 - David;: Don't push your sweaty fingers into our goals
01/07/2020, 21:18 - Sam;: Exactly. Not sure after three minutes of frame by frame replays from 3 angles, probably not a clear or easy obvious error that needs over turning is it Dr Stockley
01/07/2020, 21:19 - Jack G;: Probably just tossed a coin
01/07/2020, 21:21 - Paul;: How much were people crying out for var?
01/07/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: Quite a lot whenever a red made a cock up
01/07/2020, 21:22 - Paul;: The referee is always a wanker though
01/07/2020, 21:22 - Rob;: Goal line tech was so good I just assumed it would be that good
01/07/2020, 21:23 - Rob;: No one imagined VAR being a bigger wanker than the ref
01/07/2020, 21:23 - Phill: Why even have a ref these days?
01/07/2020, 21:23 - Phill: Just have the cunts sat in a room and blow a whistle over the tannoy
01/07/2020, 21:24 - Paul;: Have a robot displaying an algorithm?
01/07/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: We have FIFA , why bother physically playing football?
01/07/2020, 21:24 - Paul;: Just simulate in footy manager
01/07/2020, 21:25 - Paul;: Then supporters make decisions online
01/07/2020, 21:25 - Sam;: HAMMMMMMERSSS!!
01/07/2020, 21:25 - Paul;: Which regens to buy
01/07/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: 'This. Could. Be. LIFT OFF WEST HAM'
01/07/2020, 21:26 - Phill: But Rob what DLC can i get?
01/07/2020, 21:26 - Jack G;: Boom
01/07/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: Real people still have to train and develop as footballers so there's data to base the simulation on
01/07/2020, 21:27 - Jack G;: Lovely since since restart
01/07/2020, 21:27 - Hamish Sinclair: Hammers honking
01/07/2020, 21:30 - David;: We always had that. They've taken that away from us as well
01/07/2020, 21:33 - David;: Ah lanzini
01/07/2020, 21:33 - David;: Had to bloot
01/07/2020, 21:39 - David;: Fuck jack
01/07/2020, 21:39 - David;: Twitching your ass
01/07/2020, 21:40 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah
01/07/2020, 21:40 - Jack G;: Getting destroyed by Willian, what year is it?
01/07/2020, 21:42 - David;: Feels like decent prem football again after the initial dross
01/07/2020, 21:42 - Rob;: Is willian on a free this summer?
01/07/2020, 21:42 - David;: Fitness levels recovering maybe
01/07/2020, 21:43 - Jack G;: Ah Jack Wilshere
01/07/2020, 21:43 - Jack G;: I give him 10 minutes before he goes off injured
01/07/2020, 21:43 - David;: You'll take a wilshere
01/07/2020, 21:43 - Jack G;: Can make things happen
01/07/2020, 21:43 - David;: The english xavi
01/07/2020, 21:46 - Jack G;: Bollocks
01/07/2020, 21:46 - Rob;: Would take Willian on a free
01/07/2020, 21:47 - David;: Lol Neville's having a shocker 'goalkeeper should save it'. It hit the inside of the fucking post
01/07/2020, 21:47 - David;: Literally can't be placed any better
01/07/2020, 21:49 - Rob;: Willian, Modric, Eriksen and Matic all available on a free this summer. Would love one club to just get a free midfield
01/07/2020, 21:49 - David;: He's doubling down on it. Won't shut up
01/07/2020, 21:50 - Jack G;: Yeah no chance of saving it, don’t no what he’s on about
01/07/2020, 21:51 - Rob;: Gotse, Cavani, Thiago Silva, Ryan Fraser, Dried Mertens, Eric Bailey, Jan Vertongen, David Silva, Pedro, Blaise Matuidi. I might get football manager just to make a team out of that
01/07/2020, 21:54 - David;: How have they let Bailey rot away on a free?
01/07/2020, 21:54 - Phill: Dried mertens
01/07/2020, 21:54 - Sam;: Some fake news here
01/07/2020, 21:54 - Sam;: Mertens has agreed a news contract
01/07/2020, 21:54 - Sam;: Matic contract extended
01/07/2020, 21:55 - David;: Going into journalism
01/07/2020, 21:55 - Sam;: Lol
01/07/2020, 21:56 - Sam;: Which Bailey?
01/07/2020, 21:56 - Sam;: Leon?
01/07/2020, 21:57 - David;: Eric. Was stated in the OP
01/07/2020, 21:58 - Sam;: More fake news then. Contract extended
01/07/2020, 21:58 - Sam;: Bailly
01/07/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Did I no see this was written in January https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/premier-league-transfer-news-latest-rumours-gossip-free-modric-eriksen-cazorla-epl-a9267841.html
01/07/2020, 22:00 - Rob;: Rehydrated Mertens

02/07/2020, 16:57 - Sam;: He leave?
02/07/2020, 17:30 - Rob;: Apparently he said he wasn't happy getting picked less under Arteta in the disciplinary meeting they had about him grabbing Maupay by the throat, and Arteta said he would consider letting him leave for the right price
02/07/2020, 17:40 - Sam;: Shit. How did the disciplinary meeting get leaked?
02/07/2020, 17:42 - Rob;: His agent I would imagine
02/07/2020, 17:43 - Jack G;: Imagine him thinking he’s good enough to go against the manager, got to back Arteta here
02/07/2020, 18:03 - David;: Farcenal
02/07/2020, 18:04 - David;: Good to let the only player with on field leadership go I'd have thought
02/07/2020, 18:07 - David;: Dean Henderson to United
02/07/2020, 18:07 - David;: On the cards.

02/07/2020, 19:42 - David;: >Mourinho
02/07/2020, 19:44 - David;: Otamendi benched. Mahrez benched. Silva benched.
02/07/2020, 19:44 - David;: Trolliola
02/07/2020, 20:11 - Paul;: Dave/Phil/Hamish. Have you got a Liverpool shirt for this season to celebrate the title

02/07/2020, 20:52 - Damian Rumble: That makes me feel a bit better
02/07/2020, 20:52 - Jack G;: Gomez still pissed from title celebrations
02/07/2020, 21:01 - Sam;: I think there’s been a rape up there
02/07/2020, 21:08 - Damian Rumble: Really hope klop is just waiting in the dressing room with a create of beer for the Bois when they went in at half time
02/07/2020, 21:09 - Damian Rumble: Drunkenly singing "we are the champions" load enough for city to hear them
02/07/2020, 21:16 - David;: It would be more embarassing to play well. Would show we hadn't celebrated properly
02/07/2020, 21:18 - Jack G;: Should have bought a crate of warm carlsberg for the drinks break, banter
02/07/2020, 21:18 - Jack G;: Brought*

02/07/2020, 21:28 - Sam;: What 15 games unbeaten?
02/07/2020, 21:58 - David;: Just remembered the thing about David Silva being half Japanese
02/07/2020, 22:01 - Phill: Lol. The thing.
02/07/2020, 22:01 - Rob;: I sweat I've been to his Wikipedia page multiple times to check that and seen it both confirmed and refuted
02/07/2020, 22:01 - Paul;: Half Korean
02/07/2020, 22:01 - David;: It was such shit
02/07/2020, 22:02 - David;: Where did it even come from? Who was spinning that much bullshit?
02/07/2020, 22:02 - Paul;: He only eats with chop sticks though so where’d he learn that?
02/07/2020, 22:03 - Phill: What?
02/07/2020, 22:04 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:04 - Rob;: 'claimed by'
02/07/2020, 22:04 - Phill: Lol the canarian media
02/07/2020, 22:05 - David;: No this is bollocks. Sure I've been on when it has said this is a popular misconception.
02/07/2020, 22:05 - David;: Specifically seen it ruled out
02/07/2020, 22:06 - David;: You don't want to get the wrong side of those guys
02/07/2020, 22:06 - Phill: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:07 - Rob;: How is there so much confusion
02/07/2020, 22:07 - David;: So actually it's still not resolved
02/07/2020, 22:07 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:07 - Rob;: Just an old woman. Clears up nothing
02/07/2020, 22:08 - Phill: Why he wearinf boots made of scrotum?
02/07/2020, 22:08 - Paul;: The continual use of chopsticks
02/07/2020, 22:08 - Jack G;: Only a samurai would be able to cut through the defensive lines with a perfect through ball like Silva, he’s clearly half Japanese. Perfect logic
02/07/2020, 22:08 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:10 - David;: So someone uploaded this as a denial of the Japanese link but then the person below countered with the information that this is just their oldest fan
02/07/2020, 22:10 - Rob;: Yeah
02/07/2020, 22:11 - Phill: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:11 - Phill: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:11 - Rob;: I mean that would be an insanely old mum to have for a 20-domething
02/07/2020, 22:12 - Rob;: So Silva is half Japanese, half Milner?
02/07/2020, 22:12 - Phill: That does appear to be the case
02/07/2020, 22:13 - David;: I was thinking a young Jamie carragher
02/07/2020, 22:13 - Jack G;: Yea was about to say carragher
02/07/2020, 22:13 - David;: It's a carra milner hybrid
02/07/2020, 22:14 - David;: So milner is in fact half carragher
02/07/2020, 22:14 - Jack G;: Need to update Wikipedia
02/07/2020, 22:14 - Rob;: Carragher is Japanese?
02/07/2020, 22:16 - David;: David Silva is 1/2 Japanese, 1/4 Milner and  1/4 Carragher
02/07/2020, 22:16 - Rob;: Should never have played for spain
02/07/2020, 22:23 - David;: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: But what's Yoko doing in his family photo, David?
02/07/2020, 22:27 - David;: <Media omitted>
02/07/2020, 22:27 - David;: It's his word against yours, Rob.
02/07/2020, 22:30 - David;: https://www.si.com/more-sports/2011/06/13/alonso-arbeloasilva
02/07/2020, 22:31 - David;: This is the original interview where he denies it
02/07/2020, 22:31 - Rob;: Such a great scenario. Having to deny your mum is Japanese
02/07/2020, 22:32 - David;: Yeah in a legit press interview
02/07/2020, 22:32 - David;: So the photo is a forgery?
02/07/2020, 22:32 - David;: The plot thickens
02/07/2020, 22:32 - Paul;: The plot shittens
02/07/2020, 22:33 - Rob;: But the Canarian media were onto something
02/07/2020, 22:34 - David;: No that was all smoke and mirrors
02/07/2020, 22:34 - David;: https://twitter.com/JenChang888
02/07/2020, 22:35 - David;: This is the journalist that wrote the story. Still on twitter
02/07/2020, 22:35 - Rob;: It's like Damian having to deny his mother was a ferret
02/07/2020, 22:35 - David;: Considering messaging him directly
02/07/2020, 22:37 - Hamish Sinclair: This got me
02/07/2020, 22:39 - David;: This just gets deeper and deeper
02/07/2020, 22:39 - David;: https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/jen-chang-the-public-face-of-liverpool-who-threatened-a-spoof-blogger-leaves-the-club-8323732.html
02/07/2020, 22:41 - David;: That journalist became Liverpool's communications director in 2012 but then sacked for misconduct: "his credibility was irrevocably damaged over his attempts to control the ‘Duncan’ output"
02/07/2020, 22:44 - Phill: Duncan
02/07/2020, 22:44 - David;: https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20364983
02/07/2020, 22:44 - Phill: His split personality
02/07/2020, 22:45 - David;: >This story. So grotty. Still there on the internet forever
02/07/2020, 22:46 - Rob;: So known liar Chang could have made up that David Silva's mother wasn't Japanese?
02/07/2020, 22:49 - David;: Yeah
02/07/2020, 22:50 - David;: His integrity is compromised and he was writing up the article for sports illustrated that reported the denial
02/07/2020, 22:50 - David;: But at the time he was just a journalist.
02/07/2020, 22:51 - Rob;: How isn't it just known who David Silva's parents are?
02/07/2020, 22:51 - David;: Seems like he got over-promited as our Communications director.
02/07/2020, 22:51 - Phill: Out of depth
02/07/2020, 22:51 - Phill: Gets into a spat with Duncan
02/07/2020, 22:51 - David;: It's like saying how don't we just know how the universe was created.
02/07/2020, 22:52 - Phill: Youd think as comma director youd just be able to ignore Duncan
02/07/2020, 22:52 - Phill: Comms*
02/07/2020, 22:52 - David;: Yeah never get sucked into Duncan's little world. You're bigger than that Jen
02/07/2020, 22:52 - Rob;: No one has any direct experience of them
02/07/2020, 22:53 - David;: No it has to be inferred from other events
02/07/2020, 22:53 - Phill: Like when Elon Musk got involved with the thai cabe rescue and ended up calling the lead rescuer a pedo
02/07/2020, 22:53 - Phill: Just leave it mate
02/07/2020, 22:54 - Rob;: Or when Gazza turned up to give Raoul Moat some chicken and go fishing
02/07/2020, 22:54 - David;: Lol this story. Had blanked that from memory
02/07/2020, 22:54 - David;: Such an unnecessary OR disaster. End up in court for defamation.
02/07/2020, 22:55 - David;: Fundamantally you're not the emergency services, elon
02/07/2020, 22:55 - David;: *PR
02/07/2020, 22:55 - Rob;: But he had a pedo submarine designed to find young boys
02/07/2020, 22:57 - Phill: Yeah lol he was willing to develop tech to rescue those juicy thai bois
02/07/2020, 23:05 - David;: The Swiss football team specifically?
02/07/2020, 23:08 - Rob;: Hi we're a grown men's team from a country that speaks German, French and Italian. We're called Young Boys in English.
03/07/2020, 10:09 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
03/07/2020, 10:10 - Rob;: 7 more hours of this
03/07/2020, 10:10 - Hamish Sinclair: Lewis!
03/07/2020, 10:10 - Hamish Sinclair: First name terms
03/07/2020, 10:21 - / James Ball: is kate's picture a potato with pink hair
03/07/2020, 10:21 - Rob;: A cat
03/07/2020, 10:21 - Rob;: She's has purple or pink hair and likes Cats a lot but doesn't have one
03/07/2020, 10:21 - Rob;: This should all be obvious I assume
03/07/2020, 10:23 - / James Ball: ah. of course. loves cats but does not own
03/07/2020, 10:23 - / James Ball: she sounds like a blast and probably quite annoying as a boss
03/07/2020, 10:25 - Rob;: She is a highly, highly annoying person, but actually hyper competent and pretty good as a boss. You just cannot socialise with her in any meaningful way.
03/07/2020, 10:27 - / James Ball: infuriating. I've worked with some london theatre yuppie types like that. One basically had prosecco in hand all day, called everyone darling and worked in some unclear capacity for the guardian. but she was somehow very high functioning and got a lot done
03/07/2020, 10:28 - Sam;: Lol. Grainy picture shows a potato. Would actually make her more palatable to have a potato profile pic
03/07/2020, 10:29 - Rob;: This sounds awful
03/07/2020, 10:29 - Rob;: Kate is slightly different in that she's Essex and not pretentious, which is possibly better than theatre yuppie
03/07/2020, 10:30 - Rob;: I couldn't handle being called Darling
03/07/2020, 10:30 - / James Ball: also a surname of best - somewhat prophetic?
03/07/2020, 10:30 - / James Ball: in a self-absorbed way
03/07/2020, 10:31 - / James Ball: I just have to let it wash over me. theatre has lots of hugging and congratulating
03/07/2020, 10:31 - Rob;: Writing 'All the *BEST*' in all office cards is one of her key jokes
03/07/2020, 10:32 - Rob;: Probably for the best that the arts are fucked in terms of covid transmission
03/07/2020, 10:35 - / James Ball: imagine just doing a normal day's work and then have several different people come and hug and congratulate you on completing it
03/07/2020, 10:35 - / James Ball: that's essentially what I get on some theatre shows
03/07/2020, 10:36 - / James Ball: and then people sometimes get upset that you don't reciprocate the over the top superlatives
03/07/2020, 10:37 - Sam;: “Sour Ball Slammed by Colleagues”
03/07/2020, 10:39 - Rob;: BALL BALL'S YUPPIE SHAME
03/07/2020, 10:40 - Rob;: CHRISTMAS BALL BALL'S PANTS DOWN PANTO SNUB
03/07/2020, 10:40 - Sam;: The Sun just going with SOUR BALLS
03/07/2020, 10:48 - / James Ball: pretty much this level of over reaction - yes
03/07/2020, 11:24 - Stefan;: This is my aunt, except she's 70 and runs a celebrity agency in Soho
03/07/2020, 11:25 - Rob;: Have you watched Toast of London, Stefan?
03/07/2020, 11:25 - Stefan;: Everyone is darling or sweetie, and she name drops directors and actors' first names constantly
03/07/2020, 11:25 - Stefan;: Haven't heard of it
03/07/2020, 11:25 - Rob;: I am imagining your aunt as Toast's agent
03/07/2020, 11:26 - Stefan;: She is every TV stereotype, including Patsy from absolutely fabulous
03/07/2020, 11:27 - / James Ball: yes I can hear you clem fandango
03/07/2020, 11:29 - Hamish Sinclair: Isnt that your stereotypical yuppie though? An 80s phenomenon
03/07/2020, 11:29 - Hamish Sinclair: New money but culturally vapid
03/07/2020, 11:37 - Rob;: I suppose so, it's just never quite a vibe I got from her. More fiat 500 spinster aunt, which might be just where yuppies have ended up in 2020?
03/07/2020, 12:03 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
03/07/2020, 12:05 - Paul;: The virus is a Democrat ?
03/07/2020, 12:07 - Rob;: I would take that as - states that vote democrat were initially more exposed and sociable, but responded compliantly to lockdown and remained nervous about going back to normal. Republican states less exposed initially, but did not comply with the curtailing of freedoms and were enthusiastic to return to normal.
03/07/2020, 12:09 - Paul;: Is the USA virus still way off a peak?
03/07/2020, 12:10 - Sam;: They’re into a second more punishing wave
03/07/2020, 12:10 - Phill: We Morrowind now
03/07/2020, 12:10 - Phill: <Media omitted>
03/07/2020, 12:11 - Stefan;: This is what happens when you politicise mask-wearing and issues like whether the virus is real or death rates are made up
03/07/2020, 12:12 - Phill: <Media omitted>
03/07/2020, 12:13 - Phill: No loot

03/07/2020, 12:19 - Paul;: Great someone had to write this article
03/07/2020, 12:20 - Rob;: 50k+ cases a day now. Their previous peak was 35k
03/07/2020, 12:21 - Rob;: Pretty good. Near to home?
03/07/2020, 12:28 - Damian Rumble: Love it
03/07/2020, 12:28 - Damian Rumble: USA was fully johned... But they managed to find a way to John themselves even further. Or the republicans to be more accurate that is
03/07/2020, 12:30 - Rob;: Death rates are what people take notice of though and they're not yet climbing inline with the new cases though. Assume younger people are getting it disproportionately.
03/07/2020, 12:31 - Stefan;: The emerging picture is that it initially spreads among younger people, then it's passed on to the old and you get a rise in death rates
03/07/2020, 12:32 - Stefan;: But that takes a few weeks to show
03/07/2020, 12:45 - David;: Would contain restless draugr in Skyrim, you'd need flame spells for that.
03/07/2020, 12:46 - / James Ball: yes, I read the article about the version of the virus that's prevalent now - much more infectious but no more deadly.

03/07/2020, 12:50 - / James Ball: yeah basically all statistics are nearly impossible to compare. country to country / old to new
03/07/2020, 12:51 - / James Ball: it's now sweeping the red states as well which is fun. plenty of church people and sheriffs getting covid now

03/07/2020, 14:34 - Rob;: I swear it was just two households in at one time from tomorrow? The regulations get updated before you've even tried out the previous ones
03/07/2020, 14:35 - Rob;: 30 is a good party
03/07/2020, 14:38 - David;: Heard it on the radio, but then checked and it's more confusing
03/07/2020, 14:38 - David;: 'only gather in slightly larger groups of up to 30 for major life events'
03/07/2020, 14:38 - David;: But then 'not hold or attend celebrations of any size (such as parties) where it is difficult to maintain social distancing'
03/07/2020, 14:39 - David;: So you can have a party but only if distanced? But then does that make a party a 'major life event'?
03/07/2020, 14:41 - Stefan;: Fucking hell what a mess
03/07/2020, 15:58 - Damian Rumble: And that's only for England
03/07/2020, 15:58 - Damian Rumble: Not that it matters, it's not like anyone is going to enforce anything like this
03/07/2020, 16:01 - Rob;: So two households can meet up inside is actually a new rule from tomorrow too. Not confusing at all
03/07/2020, 16:02 - David;: Yeah, but then there is the talk of parties
03/07/2020, 16:02 - Rob;: What if both households have 16 people in them?
03/07/2020, 16:18 - David;: They seem to talk as if the bubble is still a thing but doesn't this change make that completely redundant?
03/07/2020, 16:18 - Rob;: Yeah

04/07/2020, 14:52 - Rob;: So he thinks defence more than attack. Said they don’t concede much, with obvious caveat of championship attacks being worse than prem. The full backs contribute a lot of assists, some goals. Ayling, Alioski and Dallas recommend as good value
04/07/2020, 14:52 - Rob;: Be said goals have been a problem. Bamford top scorer with 14
04/07/2020, 14:53 - Rob;: Jack Harrison in midfield should reach 20 combined goals and assists

04/07/2020, 16:15 - David;: Well butter my arsehole this has become very interesting
04/07/2020, 16:15 - David;: It already is interesting
04/07/2020, 16:16 - Jack G;: The boy Greenwood
04/07/2020, 16:17 - Phill: This has to stop now.
04/07/2020, 16:17 - Rob;: Love how on the fan cam reactions there's always at least one person who just hasn't noticed
04/07/2020, 16:17 - Phill: I dont have ny rhymes unfortunately
04/07/2020, 16:21 - Rob;: Goals goals everywhere
04/07/2020, 16:28 - David;: But not a point to drink
04/07/2020, 16:28 - Rob;: Hernandes 👌🏻
04/07/2020, 16:28 - David;: Mine supplied above
04/07/2020, 16:29 - Rob;: *Fernandes. My phone cannot accept his name

04/07/2020, 16:50 - Paul;: Old Urny
04/07/2020, 16:50 - Paul;: Uncle Urny
04/07/2020, 16:53 - David;: Annoyingly they seem to have stumbled on a midfield
04/07/2020, 16:56 - Sam;: Stumbled? Stumbled into buying Fernandes. Wake up
04/07/2020, 16:58 - Paul;: Oh wake up
04/07/2020, 17:23 - Paul;: DAVID LUIZ
04/07/2020, 17:24 - David;: Ah that's great. I love to see that.
04/07/2020, 17:24 - David;: I love to see great form rewarded
04/07/2020, 17:39 - David;: Sambo what's the post football plan. Are you going out in the big banners opening night
04/07/2020, 17:39 - David;: Or bedding down
04/07/2020, 17:42 - Sam;: Bedding down. Pub is pointless. Have to book. Maximum 2 hour slot.
04/07/2020, 17:42 - Sam;: Shite weather
04/07/2020, 17:44 - David;: Big films?
04/07/2020, 17:44 - Phill: Can we get footage etc from the night pls
04/07/2020, 17:45 - David;: <Media omitted>
04/07/2020, 17:47 - Sam;: Cheeky
04/07/2020, 17:48 - Sam;: Two live games on sky
04/07/2020, 17:49 - David;: You'll need to plan beyond that though
04/07/2020, 17:49 - David;: Into the wee hours
04/07/2020, 17:53 - Damian Rumble: >tiktok
04/07/2020, 18:07 - Jack G;: Nketiah looks a good player
04/07/2020, 18:13 - David;: Don't rate
04/07/2020, 18:13 - David;: Lightweight
04/07/2020, 18:50 - Jack G;: Cricket back on Wednesday then. Nice little test match against the West Indies
04/07/2020, 18:57 - David;: Huge
04/07/2020, 19:07 - David;: So many average arsenal players. Maitland-Niles, Willock, Nketiah.
04/07/2020, 19:07 - David;: A lot of meh
04/07/2020, 19:08 - Jack G;: >thinking youth players should be world beaters
04/07/2020, 19:09 - David;: No but they need to show something
04/07/2020, 19:09 - David;: Inconsistently is fine but they all seem consistently average.
04/07/2020, 19:10 - David;: Compare Greenwood. Mount. Maddison. Foden. Alexander-Arnold.
04/07/2020, 19:11 - Jack G;: Saka, Martinelli. That two youth players that are top quality from Arsenal
04/07/2020, 19:12 - Jack G;: You can’t have them all doing well
04/07/2020, 19:13 - David;: Agree Martinelli. So obviously he's the one they are not playing.
04/07/2020, 19:14 - Sam;: Martinelli injured?
04/07/2020, 19:15 - Jack G;: Yeah he’s injured
04/07/2020, 19:15 - David;: That was one of the 15 conspiracy theories I seem to recall
04/07/2020, 19:15 - Rob;: Unfair to single them out. The entire squad has underperformed across an incredibly chaotic season, created by mismanagement from the top down to the coaching. This is a pretty promising batch of youth players, some of whom might go on to be pretty good players. You can't make it the fault of the least experienced members of the squad when they're part of a woefully out of form team.
04/07/2020, 19:15 - Rob;: These players have been doing well as a part of teams that have been performing as a whole
04/07/2020, 19:16 - Rob;: Martinelli is injured yeah, long one
04/07/2020, 19:17 - David;: Not really. Greenwood broke through when United were still shit and has improved them and influenced the squad. Mount et al at Chelsea given lots of responsibility in a transition season under lampard and have made that successful. Trent broke through before we had had our first run to champions league final and defence was still a shambles
04/07/2020, 19:18 - Jack G;: I think you’re underrating Arsenals youth massively here Dave
04/07/2020, 19:18 - Sam;: Yeah but Dave it’s also about who each team has in that position when they broke through
04/07/2020, 19:19 - David;: Trent. Displaced clyne who at the time was England right back.
04/07/2020, 19:19 - Sam;: TAA, broke through when Clyne was injured, had no one else
04/07/2020, 19:20 - Sam;: Martinelli getting in when there’s auba and laca
04/07/2020, 19:20 - David;: Don't understand the point. Are you saying its more or less impressive to do it with good players to compete with already?
04/07/2020, 19:21 - Sam;: More impressive when there are good players to compete with
04/07/2020, 19:21 - Sam;: Though luck plays its part
04/07/2020, 19:21 - Sam;: Rashford picked because martial injured in the warm
Up
04/07/2020, 19:22 - Jack G;: Any good liverpool youth prospects getting first team time at the moment?
04/07/2020, 19:22 - David;: Yeah. But arsenal have quite cack players in those positions bar strikers so that supports my point.
04/07/2020, 19:22 - David;: Curtis jones. Harvey elliot. Nico Williams.
04/07/2020, 19:22 - Sam;: But we focusing on martinelli?
04/07/2020, 19:22 - Sam;: Striker
04/07/2020, 19:23 - David;: Nah i was originally slamming the others. I rate Martinelli.
04/07/2020, 19:23 - Sam;: Faiths
04/07/2020, 19:23 - Sam;: Fairps
04/07/2020, 19:23 - Sam;: What about sanka?
04/07/2020, 19:23 - Sam;: Saka
04/07/2020, 19:23 - David;: I just think it's all well giving them credit for being young and seeing the potential. A lot of them are around 20 and don't influence games. Good players are usually doing that more regulary then
04/07/2020, 19:23 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/07/2020, 19:25 - David;: I was specifically talking about Willock, Maitland Niles and Nketiah. Pepe was a huge money signing and already established. Martinelli is decent. Saka blows hot and cold could do something.
04/07/2020, 19:25 - David;: Those 3 are dross imo
04/07/2020, 19:26 - Rob;: Maitland Niles is a squad player and no one's really putting him up there as a great prospect
04/07/2020, 19:26 - Rob;: I wasn't counting Pepe as youth obviously
04/07/2020, 19:27 - David;: I guess it more just reveals the husk of your transfer policy where they have to play such key roles in the squad
04/07/2020, 19:30 - David;: Any news on transfer targets this summer?
04/07/2020, 19:31 - David;: Hearing a lot about Thomas Partey
04/07/2020, 19:32 - Rob;: I want him just for the name tbh
04/07/2020, 19:32 - Rob;: He's the only consistent rumour
04/07/2020, 19:32 - Rob;: I'm not really bothering to read much transfer stuff though tbh
04/07/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
04/07/2020, 20:22 - David;: Did Troy take Deeney before the game?
04/07/2020, 20:22 - Paul;: Troideenie 🇮🇹
04/07/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: Abraham benched then
04/07/2020, 20:26 - David;: Inexplicable
04/07/2020, 20:27 - David;: Very much a wet shart of a game thus far

05/07/2020, 21:09 - Rob;: Ah yeah. That's the place to be
05/07/2020, 21:10 - Rob;: I was meant to be in Sri Lanka today, Maldives tomorrow. Instead I spent my day laying self levelling concrete compound 👌🏻

05/07/2020, 21:16 - Phill: Yeah thats a steal. £22.50 each per night.
05/07/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Yerp. No onsite restaurant or pool, which would normally be there, but we don't want that in the circumstances anyway. Just going to barbecue and beach
05/07/2020, 21:17 - Phill: Yeah yeah. Not been to Norfolk ever. Whats it famous for gump/booze wise?

07/07/2020, 15:50 - Rob;: It's got very tight at the top of the Jules Chippet

07/07/2020, 15:52 - Damian Rumble: Rob and I only 60 points behind as well
07/07/2020, 15:55 - David;: Yeah getting very interesting. Good to see teams outside the big 2 still able to compete.
07/07/2020, 16:08 - Phill: Roast that lamb slow and low, on a bed of potatos and onion and the juice from the lamb will seep into the potats
07/07/2020, 16:15 - Damian Rumble: Sarah doesn't like lamb. Probably should have asked that on the first date...
07/07/2020, 16:49 - David;: I will miss having it on the old mantlepiece

07/07/2020, 18:08 - David;: This is a problem.
07/07/2020, 18:08 - David;: What's her beef with lamb?
07/07/2020, 18:08 - David;: Hib
07/07/2020, 18:09 - Damian Rumble: Apparently the flavour is too strong
07/07/2020, 18:10 - Damian Rumble: It's same reason she doesn't like fish/olives
07/07/2020, 18:11 - Jack G;: I’ve got the same problem, Lamb is a no go with Shannon. Always cook some when she’s off at her mum’s or something
07/07/2020, 18:11 - Phill: I used to despise lamb. Favourite meat now.
07/07/2020, 18:12 - David;: It's the king meat. Lamb followed by beef followed by pork followed by chicken
07/07/2020, 18:13 - David;: Weird shit like venison not included.
07/07/2020, 18:13 - David;: Unclassified
07/07/2020, 18:13 - Paul;: Fish is complete shit
07/07/2020, 18:14 - David;: Mental. Your cod and chips. Your chowder. Your smoked salmon
07/07/2020, 18:19 - Jack G;: Lol, just writing off fish. Same opinion on sea food in general?

07/07/2020, 18:30 - Paul;: Cod in fish and chips, anchovy on pizza and very rarely smoked salmon are all I will engage with. Always an ulterior motive with seafood

07/07/2020, 18:42 - David;: Gallons of red wine. Lamb on the roast. Fire. Rain is that level of intensity where it blows across sideways in curtains
07/07/2020, 18:42 - David;: No more activity planned for the day but festering
07/07/2020, 18:43 - David;: Colonel fester, in the drawing room, with the mustard
07/07/2020, 18:45 - Sam;: Succumb to the gout. Let it fester in you.
07/07/2020, 19:07 - Stefan;: Bennett also dislikes lamb, and yeah I always make it too when he's away. Tbf it's an unusual taste of meat
07/07/2020, 19:09 - / James Ball: A meaty taste of mest

07/07/2020, 20:52 - David;: Mint sauce is game changing
07/07/2020, 20:53 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah takes lamb up a level
07/07/2020, 21:49 - Jack G;: Since when can VAR review yellow cards to see if it’s a red. Pretty sure that’s not been allowed before
07/07/2020, 21:51 - Jack G;: Not saying it’s a bad thing but it seems arbitrary they’ve just started now

08/07/2020, 13:54 - Phill: Does that include supermarket gumping?
08/07/2020, 13:55 - Paul;: What’s gump classified in this?
08/07/2020, 13:56 - / James Ball: 5% VAT on food, accommodation and entertainment
08/07/2020, 13:56 - Paul;: Are you spreading fake news or can we buy McCoy’s multi packs with 15% less vat
08/07/2020, 13:56 - / James Ball: Plus selected 50% discount restaurant vouchers for August

08/07/2020, 18:20 - Paul;: Did city have a troll rotation manager before Guardiola?
08/07/2020, 18:20 - Paul;: Who was the last great rotation troll?
08/07/2020, 19:00 - Damian Rumble: This just means the Tories are setting themselves up for a double whammy of a 15% VAT rise plus a tonne of no deal brexit inflation come January
08/07/2020, 19:01 - Damian Rumble: He's only trolly if you pick the players who get rotated
08/07/2020, 19:04 - Paul;: Dunno. Not as much money leaving the country as before. I think Dave mentioned a thing about Keynes and monetary policy in this kind of environment? It doesn’t necessarily produce inflation but need Dave to comment
08/07/2020, 19:07 - Paul;: Lots of people have money they’d usually spend abroad or on holidays left over to spend at home
08/07/2020, 19:13 - Rob;: I'm a bit annoyed to hav just paid some stamp duty, but oh well. They are also offering incentives to insulate your house and other environmentally friendly renovations, so we can probably get some money off things we were going to do anyway
08/07/2020, 19:14 - Paul;: I still like that story of the guy cancelling on the house purchase only for it to actually go for £10k more
08/07/2020, 19:15 - Paul;: Their dream home
08/07/2020, 19:15 - Paul;: No luv, markets done for. We’ll pull out the deal and get it cheaper in a few months
08/07/2020, 19:15 - Rob;: Well yeah, that was Julia's brother. They just make another 11k today on not having to pay stamp duty
08/07/2020, 19:16 - Paul;: 21k profit
08/07/2020, 19:16 - Paul;: Extra even
08/07/2020, 19:20 - Rob;: And the person who pulled out was a first time buyer and the house is under £300k, so it's not like they will have benefited from the stamp duty scrapping anyway
08/07/2020, 19:23 - Phill: We need to bring our move forwards now to save £10k on stamp duty
08/07/2020, 19:24 - Phill: But now need to pay early buyout on mortgage

11/07/2020, 14:11 - Rob;: Yeah. Quite a low scoring golden boot that year. Only 20

12/07/2020, 11:48 - David;: *shit
12/07/2020, 11:49 - Damian Rumble: Certainly by clicking on and sharing weird shit this will train the algorithm that that's the stuff you and people like you (a.k.a your friends) are interested in
12/07/2020, 11:50 - / James Ball: No clicks or shares
12/07/2020, 11:50 - / James Ball: Screenshot only
12/07/2020, 11:50 - David;: That's great so they are training it to recognise things no one would ever buy
12/07/2020, 11:50 - David;: Training it away from purchases
12/07/2020, 11:51 - Damian Rumble: If its a good system it will be able to interpret the time you spend hovering over the as relatives to the rest of you activity as an interest
12/07/2020, 11:51 - / James Ball: I know about hover time. I also know that interest based ads are turned off on basically every platform I use
12/07/2020, 11:52 - / James Ball: Or blocked
12/07/2020, 11:52 - Damian Rumble: It's more that it trains it's on human behaviour and humans are inherently grotty. It's why people by 'the Star'
12/07/2020, 11:53 - / James Ball: Yeah yeah. Put wacky things out there and more people look at you. Doesn't mean it translates to sales
12/07/2020, 11:53 - / James Ball: More that it confirms wish is garbage
12/07/2020, 12:07 - Paul;: I to get shit suggestions from wish

12/07/2020, 12:25 - David;: So they only do weird shit based products?

12/07/2020, 12:33 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
12/07/2020, 12:40 - / James Ball: They are basically a direct seller of whatever Chinese products you can imagine. But their ads always seem to be insane
12/07/2020, 12:53 - David;: Ah, no.
12/07/2020, 12:55 - Rob;: Footballer of the year in his 60s
12/07/2020, 12:55 - Rob;: Won the world cup for Britain in 96

12/07/2020, 16:07 - Rob;: Average the mid point of those R ranges?
12/07/2020, 16:09 - / James Ball: But the overall is given as a range too
12/07/2020, 16:46 - David;: Could it be that those 1s are rounding up from e.g. 0.95 and then the 0.9 in Midlands is rounding up from e.g. 0.85 it would tip you over to 0.9
12/07/2020, 16:47 - Hamish Sinclair: I think there's been a goal up there!
12/07/2020, 16:47 - David;: Ah he's scored a goal there
12/07/2020, 16:48 - Jack G;: Just a little goal
12/07/2020, 16:49 - Jack G;: I liked that goal, another please
12/07/2020, 16:49 - David;: Ah there it is
12/07/2020, 16:50 - David;: There's always David luiz to keep things interesting
12/07/2020, 16:50 - Jack G;: North London derby always delivers goals
12/07/2020, 16:50 - David;: I just absolutely love that he's straight back in the team
12/07/2020, 16:50 - David;: They saw the red card. They saw the howler. And they said that's great we want much more of that
12/07/2020, 16:53 - David;: Was fully expecting Mourinho to turn it shit but thankfully even he can't
12/07/2020, 17:03 - David;: This game. The long shot derby
12/07/2020, 17:44 - Jack G;: Day Mustafi overhead kick
12/07/2020, 18:01 - David;: Mustafi is also a calamity. Him and Luiz is a mental defence
12/07/2020, 18:05 - Rob;: His rehabilitation has been a shock
12/07/2020, 18:09 - David;: What's your on paper strongest defence?
12/07/2020, 18:09 - David;: Koscielny ded?
12/07/2020, 18:11 - Rob;: Koscielmy forced a move, which led to David Luiz
12/07/2020, 18:12 - David;: Lol mustafi there
12/07/2020, 18:12 - David;: Amazing
12/07/2020, 18:14 - David;: Sell both and get a completely new defence.

13/07/2020, 10:00 - Rob;: No ban
13/07/2020, 10:00 - Jack G;: What a joke, financial fair play basically doesn’t exist anymore then with this precedent being set
13/07/2020, 11:19 - Sam;: Yeah, toothless. CAS has overturned everything sent up to them
13/07/2020, 11:20 - Sam;: Wa ya mean no breach!
13/07/2020, 11:21 - Rob;: They probably should have expected that clubs they were reprimanding for being too rich might have access to expensive legal teams
13/07/2020, 11:21 - Rob;: 'it turns out they have more money than we do to fight this. I'm livid'
13/07/2020, 11:21 - Jack G;: Looks like City’s defence was that over 2 years had passed since the breach and therefore the deadline for any action against the fraudulent transactions had passed
13/07/2020, 11:22 - Jack G;: So basically you just need to hide dodgy transactions for 2 years and delay and investigations then you’re fine
13/07/2020, 11:22 - Jack G;: Any*

13/07/2020, 17:46 - Rob;: It's definitely not 2009. No women then. We played the last football game of the decade and in ended up in the pond after a 50-50 tackle
13/07/2020, 17:47 - David;: Yeah yeah. The night Griff bit Jack was also later, 2011 perhaps
13/07/2020, 17:47 - Rob;: Yeah, that was possibly the last true El Classico?
13/07/2020, 17:48 - Rob;: Hamish was asked to check in on your baby nephew as if he wouldn't be getting incredibly drunk
13/07/2020, 17:48 - Rob;: Griff's dead now, so I guess you won that feud Jack
13/07/2020, 18:04 - / James Ball: Is it definitely at Dave's? It's not Emily parker's house in Charlbury is it?

13/07/2020, 19:58 - Rob;: Quite big to even be in it considering how last season went to begin with
13/07/2020, 20:45 - David;: Classic Neville. Make a snap pro-united judgement before you've seen something and then double down regardless of anything the replay shows
13/07/2020, 20:48 - Sam;: Romeu?
13/07/2020, 20:48 - Rob;: 1-1. Cross-cum-shot / angry cum shot

13/07/2020, 20:49 - Sam;: Akinfenwa coming on
13/07/2020, 20:49 - Sam;: The beast
13/07/2020, 20:52 - David;: Yeah, not much in that clearly. But because he said it pre replay he sticks with it
13/07/2020, 20:53 - David;: Is he at Oxford?
13/07/2020, 20:54 - David;: Ah no wycome. The only player to have strength 20 in fifa apparently

13/07/2020, 21:00 - David;: Half time analysis team are finally talking sense. You've got to put anything Neville says in a thick layer of bread
13/07/2020, 21:01 - Sam;: It might not have been intentional but was dangerous

13/07/2020, 21:05 - Phill: Deluded mancs with normal names also exist.
13/07/2020, 21:06 - Sam;: Sort of, bit controversial when they ended the league

13/07/2020, 21:14 - David;: Just remembered that grey grotty scandal of goalkeeping coach who got done for gumping pies in an FA cup tie. Turned out he was in the pocket of the pie betting companies

13/07/2020, 21:20 - David;: Was it that people were betting on when he would gump the pie?
13/07/2020, 21:20 - Sam;: Yeah
13/07/2020, 21:20 - Sam;: He then came out with the pie on cue
13/07/2020, 21:21 - Sam;: Could’ve eaten that behind closed doors
13/07/2020, 21:22 - David;: But the pie bets were laid independently?
13/07/2020, 21:22 - David;: Doesn't seem that fair you can't stop the guy eating his pie
13/07/2020, 21:22 - Sam;: I think the ties between the betters and Shaw were easily established
13/07/2020, 21:23 - David;: The pie ring
13/07/2020, 21:23 - Paul;: The man just wanted a quick pie
13/07/2020, 21:23 - Sam;: And the ties to the pie
13/07/2020, 21:23 - Sam;: Pukka lies

13/07/2020, 21:24 - Sam;: RIGGED
13/07/2020, 21:25 - David;: It was an open and shut mouth/case
13/07/2020, 21:25 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
13/07/2020, 21:26 - David;: So if someone bets on you eating a pie you can't eat a pie?
13/07/2020, 21:26 - Paul;: He’d be the kind of person who would end up on a celebrity big brother
13/07/2020, 21:27 - Sam;: Ah so he’s innocent. Stupid but innocent. Did the deed but not the money making bit?
13/07/2020, 21:27 - David;: If someone bets against me inhaling oxygen I'm not allowed to breathe?
13/07/2020, 21:28 - Sam;: If you do it on tv. No
13/07/2020, 21:28 - David;: A pie is an englishmans right
13/07/2020, 21:32 - Rob;: But it was actually a pasty
13/07/2020, 21:32 - Sam;: An epitaph
13/07/2020, 21:33 - Rob;: That's a key technicality. Exactly the sort of reason a betting company wouldn't pay out
13/07/2020, 21:51 - Rob;: I love that he was a player coach
13/07/2020, 21:51 - Rob;: Would have played in the next game

13/07/2020, 23:39 - Damian Rumble: Oh god this could take a while
13/07/2020, 23:48 - Damian Rumble: My mum as been keeping bees on her allotment in enstone for at least the last 10 years. Queue some random new woman moves into the allotment and starts kicking up a fuss that they might sting her. Ultimately, after political struggle with the allotment committee, my mum loses and has to move her bees to a new site in chippy. "How do you move a hive of bees?" I hear no body cry. Well naturally my parents decided to block up the hives, put them in the car and drive them over. Predictably the hives became unblocked and the angry bees swarmed out enroute. This wasn't a problem for my mum who was wearing the only bee suit. For my dad, who was simply wearing layers of hoodies and scarfs, this was a problem. He ended up with dozens of bee stings all over his face and apparently swelled up so much he could barely see.
14/07/2020, 07:34 - Hamish Sinclair: Who was driving?
14/07/2020, 08:35 - Rob;: You wouldn't move to Margate then demand they move the the sea elsewhere
14/07/2020, 08:37 - Rob;: You said your dad brushed off the dozens of stings as if they were nothing, despite the obvious lack of site
14/07/2020, 08:44 - Damian Rumble: Yeah he was pretty chill with the whole experience. I assume it must have been my mum driving
14/07/2020, 08:55 - Hamish Sinclair: That woman  sounds like a dick though. Like people who buy a flat above a successful bar and then lodge noise complaints to get it shut down
14/07/2020, 12:09 - Rob;: Damian was it you who lent me Paper Mario on the GameCube?
14/07/2020, 12:09 - Rob;: Amazing game
14/07/2020, 12:09 - Rob;: There's a new one out on Switch this week
14/07/2020, 12:11 - Rob;: But I just read the two paper mario games they released since the GameCube one were universally hated for ditching all the RPG elements. Need to investigate big the new one is any good

15/07/2020, 16:32 - David;: We had all the summer in one go
15/07/2020, 16:32 - David;: Seems to be over now
15/07/2020, 16:32 - David;: Just dull shitty grey every day
15/07/2020, 17:23 - Damian Rumble: Are you sure that's not just because you are in Wales?
15/07/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: It's horrid here in the urban heat island
15/07/2020, 17:32 - Damian Rumble: Very sticky
15/07/2020, 17:32 - Damian Rumble: But still cold and clamy outside
15/07/2020, 17:43 - / James Ball: not sticky in oxford
15/07/2020, 17:43 - / James Ball: just grey
15/07/2020, 17:43 - / James Ball: occasional rain
15/07/2020, 17:43 - Paul;: grey here
15/07/2020, 17:43 - / James Ball: no more summer
15/07/2020, 17:44 - / James Ball: we had summer 1 in april. summer 2 in june
15/07/2020, 17:44 - / James Ball: heres hoping for summer 3 in september
15/07/2020, 17:44 - / James Ball: i was pleased today that my morning coffee was 26p cheaper thanks to the VAT cut though
15/07/2020, 17:45 - / James Ball: that'll offset the months of lost earnings in no time
15/07/2020, 17:58 - David;: Anyone know if the discount is per person or over table?
15/07/2020, 17:58 - David;: On meals
15/07/2020, 18:00 - Stefan;: Up to £10 per person
15/07/2020, 18:11 - Rob;: And it applies everywhere? So you could go to the most expensive restaurant possible and get £10 off?
15/07/2020, 18:14 - Sam;: Participating restaurants only
15/07/2020, 18:28 - / James Ball: KFC?
15/07/2020, 18:28 - Rob;: KFC are discounting buckets so a good place to maximize value
15/07/2020, 18:44 - Paul;: what about bale, is he a transfer target
15/07/2020, 18:44 - Paul;: he does fuck all
15/07/2020, 18:50 - Sam;: Nah, he’s priced out of a move this summer by his wages and having 2 yrs left on his conty
15/07/2020, 18:53 - Rob;: You've seen him pretending to be asleep and making telescopes on the bench, Paul?
15/07/2020, 18:53 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
15/07/2020, 18:56 - Paul;: yeah, not playing footy

15/07/2020, 18:57 - Rob;: The shit that's gone on
15/07/2020, 18:59 - Rob;: Zidane making a condition of his return that Bale had to go
15/07/2020, 19:01 - Paul;: lol bale pulling a blinder. sit back and earn 35mil
15/07/2020, 19:01 - Rob;: Smile every time o see your bank balance
15/07/2020, 19:02 - David;: I like the detail of the whole deal falling through because of the Rodriguez offer that then didn't go ahead
15/07/2020, 19:04 - David;: It's very Phil managing Torres on FM11
15/07/2020, 20:44 - David;: Got Kane in
15/07/2020, 20:47 - David;: Why isn't auba playing?
15/07/2020, 20:49 - Rob;: Rested for the FA cup semi-final on Saturday
15/07/2020, 20:49 - Phill: Are you mathematically out of top 4?
15/07/2020, 20:50 - Rob;: Yeah
15/07/2020, 20:50 - Phill: Fair
15/07/2020, 20:51 - Rob;: It might have been on if we'd have beaten Leicester and Spurs, especially if City ban upheld, but it's certainly all off now
15/07/2020, 20:57 - Phill: Lol Amber Heard getting rekt
15/07/2020, 20:59 - Sam;: Little game on our hands now
15/07/2020, 21:00 - David;: Self inflicted
15/07/2020, 21:00 - Rob;: You've been all over yourselves in this half
15/07/2020, 21:03 - Jack G;: I thought Arsenal were the ones renowned for comical defensive mistakes
15/07/2020, 21:03 - Phill: We just toying
15/07/2020, 21:03 - Phill: Tickling the butthole
15/07/2020, 21:23 - Rob;: That bit that led to the corner was the most ridiculous bit of football I have watched
15/07/2020, 21:26 - David;: When Trent managed to boot it into salahs perennium?
15/07/2020, 21:27 - Rob;: Yeah, after we passed it to him, then blocked everything by falling over
15/07/2020, 21:30 - Jack G;: How come Nketiah got a red after VAR against Leicester yet that Trent challenge wasn’t even looked at
15/07/2020, 21:30 - Hamish Sinclair: He was pulling out
15/07/2020, 21:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Most of the contact in the other direction
15/07/2020, 21:31 - Hamish Sinclair: Solid booking
15/07/2020, 21:31 - Phill: Because neither were a red card and the ref got this decision right?
15/07/2020, 21:32 - Rob;: Nketiah was pretty unlucky to have the ref's decision overruled. Don't really want to see that happen to ever tackle forever in search of justice
15/07/2020, 21:32 - Jack G;: I see barely any difference in the challenges
15/07/2020, 21:32 - Jack G;: Just the inconsistency is grating
15/07/2020, 21:33 - Rob;: Sure, but two wrongs and all that
15/07/2020, 21:33 - Phill: <Media omitted>
15/07/2020, 21:33 - Phill: But rob, one decision has to be correct?
15/07/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: Yeah, neither should have been sent off
15/07/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: I'm agreeing with you
15/07/2020, 21:34 - Phill: Yeah yeah.
15/07/2020, 21:34 - Phill: Both yellows. Next.
15/07/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: Let the ref decide on things he's seen as well
15/07/2020, 21:35 - Phill: Im forever blowing bubbles (of cum).
15/07/2020, 21:35 - Jack G;: There’s a VAR man waiting in the dry, he’d love to give a penno, but then give no reasons why

There’s a VAR man, he’s got to get his way, to send your keeper packing, just to ruin your whole day
15/07/2020, 21:35 - Rob;: Bowie ahead of his time again
15/07/2020, 21:38 - Paul;: Lol

15/07/2020, 21:46 - Phill: >profit above community
15/07/2020, 21:46 - David;: Such a great visual metaphor for the club
15/07/2020, 21:47 - Rob;: What would you do with it?
15/07/2020, 21:47 - Phill: New stadium?
15/07/2020, 21:48 - Rob;: For who?
15/07/2020, 21:49 - Phill: Y

15/07/2020, 21:49 - Phill: u
15/07/2020, 21:49 - Rob;: Wasn't possible to extend it or build a bigger one on that site
15/07/2020, 21:49 - David;: Commemorative duck pond?
15/07/2020, 21:50 - Phill: Not possible, or, a big developer paid someone to decline the planning permission so they could build more unaffordable housing for maximum profit?
15/07/2020, 21:53 - Rob;: It was the council that didn't allow it. We tried  for years before the Emirates site became available
15/07/2020, 21:53 - Rob;: You're obviously going to sell it once you move. You don't keep your old house when you move
15/07/2020, 21:54 - Sam;: Shaqiri’s hair. He done something. What he do?
15/07/2020, 21:55 - Phill: Why didnt they allow it?
15/07/2020, 21:55 - Rob;: Still looks like Highbury from the outside. The east stand fascia is grade II listed, so it sort of feels like it's still there
15/07/2020, 21:55 - Sam;: Or is a thatching effect. Got bird in to craft a thick nest of hair for him
15/07/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: Capacity was reduced a lot following Hillsborough and the Taylor report, then the community blocked subsequent extension requests. Don't know the ins and outs, but I guess it was too close to people's homes already, with narrow streets that get rammed on matchday
15/07/2020, 21:59 - Rob;: It's nestled in closer to homes even more than Anfield is
15/07/2020, 22:03 - Rob;: https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/78yj9e/why-liverpool-let-its-neighbours-go-to-hell

17/07/2020, 12:35 - Damian Rumble: Lockdown ded
17/07/2020, 12:36 - Damian Rumble: Good to end social distancing by October. Especially as there hasn't recently been any kind of study, or historical evidence, to predict a second wave in the winter...
17/07/2020, 12:38 - Jack G;: How would you propose to provide retail and hospitality staff/businesses with their livelihood?
17/07/2020, 12:43 - Damian Rumble: I would probably be honest with the people and say there is a likelihood that lockdown for those industries would have to return to some extent in the winter, and the furlough scheme would be extended to compensate them during that time
17/07/2020, 12:51 - Jack G;: But they’re already winding down the furlough scheme and it had huge holes to begin with evidenced by the 650k reduction in payroll numbers over lockdown plus all the self employees that have been screwed over. You can’t trust the furlough system at all
17/07/2020, 12:57 - Damian Rumble: It's the Tories. They were bound to fuck it up weren't they.
17/07/2020, 12:59 - / James Ball: Flawed argument - economy is fucked either way

17/07/2020, 17:02 - Phill: Ive fucking blown it by not hopping on the Ings wagon
17/07/2020, 17:02 - Phill: Hamish to win it in the final week. Nothing i can do now.
17/07/2020, 17:03 - Rob;: I had vague hopes of getting bin the mix right at the end, then the last two weeks all my players got send off, booked and conceded huge numbers of goals. Minus points and zeros everywhere
17/07/2020, 17:05 - Rob;: I don't think we've had a title race this close
17/07/2020, 17:42 - Damian Rumble: Bandwagoning Ings hard after failing to do so for the entire rest of the season.

18/07/2020, 20:14 - David;: Arsenal actually doing football
18/07/2020, 20:19 - Rob;: An hour of twitching my ass ahead
18/07/2020, 20:35 - David;: I'd love it, love it if you beat them
18/07/2020, 20:36 - David;: If us losing has given the confidence that is inspiring this it was all worth it.
18/07/2020, 20:36 - David;: Part of the Klopp master plan
18/07/2020, 20:40 - Rob;: Not feeling optimistic of winning the cup if we do get to the final. Seven final wins in a row seems unlikely. Due a loss surely.
18/07/2020, 20:43 - Rob;: Although we've lost every  final in other competitions in that time
18/07/2020, 20:43 - David;: Also wouldn't it just make arteta harder to sack so it papers over the cracks
18/07/2020, 20:45 - Rob;: I don't think we'd be anywhere near sacking him at all, so it could only be good. Those first two games after lockdown aside, he's shown some positives. Needs at least a summer transfer window and a full season before you can make a judgement
18/07/2020, 20:47 - David;: I'm sceptical he has the experience for the rebuilding job long term so it just seems likely to land you in the same position next year
18/07/2020, 20:48 - David;: Needs a big character, a simeone etc. but that fits the style you're wanting to develop
18/07/2020, 20:54 - Rob;: Sure. I was surprised he was considered when Wenger left, and got the job when Emery was sacked, but they obviously see something in him. I think we'd really benefi from the stability of keeping a manager for a few seasons so we're not constantly implementing new ideas and seeing players suddenly our of favour.
18/07/2020, 20:58 - David;: Yeah stability. Either back him properly or get someone in during the transfer window. Worst case is to give him a few months, form dips, sack him under the pressure, whole cycle starts again
18/07/2020, 20:59 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. Believe in your own project
18/07/2020, 20:59 - David;: Fuck this.
18/07/2020, 20:59 - David;: Decent save
18/07/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: Was happy to jettison Emery. Seemed to use _Fear, tinker, bore_ was his _Live, laugh, love_
18/07/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: Martinez has good arms and legs

18/07/2020, 21:12 - Rob;: Yeah. Need to get out and have some chances or it's dead
18/07/2020, 21:13 - David;: Tactic seems to be drop deep and leave gaps
18/07/2020, 21:13 - Rob;: What can you do against such reckless football
18/07/2020, 21:14 - Rob;: Not as good as they are are winning and keeping the ball, so can't relieve the pressure
18/07/2020, 21:15 - David;: Drop deep, leave gaps and cede possession
18/07/2020, 21:15 - David;: It's unconventional
18/07/2020, 21:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Hebib
18/07/2020, 21:15 - David;: Massive
18/07/2020, 21:15 - David;: That would be a goal
18/07/2020, 21:16 - David;: Turns out this is brilliantly effective
18/07/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: The new way to play. Be dominated. Score almost every chance you get
18/07/2020, 21:16 - David;: Ah city. Too good
18/07/2020, 21:16 - David;: It doesn't matter what they do
18/07/2020, 21:16 - Rob;: When Aubameyang leaves we are so fucked
18/07/2020, 21:16 - Hamish Sinclair: Very rare for coaches to beat their mentors
18/07/2020, 21:18 - David;: Did Mourinho have any offspring? Or too much of a cunt
18/07/2020, 21:18 - David;: Villas boas I guess
18/07/2020, 21:18 - David;: Klopp has wagner
18/07/2020, 21:19 - David;: Would be good if Wagner and Arteta get promoted to big prem clubs and end up replaying the rivalry
18/07/2020, 21:21 - David;: Someone needs to stop them winning the champs league again. Who's still in it?
18/07/2020, 21:21 - Damian Rumble: MCI ded
18/07/2020, 21:22 - Hamish Sinclair: <Media omitted>
18/07/2020, 21:23 - Hamish Sinclair: City have to get through real madrid, then lyon/juve followed by napoli/barca/chelsea/bayern
18/07/2020, 21:23 - David;: That's decent
18/07/2020, 21:23 - David;: Lots of troll potential there
18/07/2020, 21:23 - Hamish Sinclair: Psg have an easy run, have to beat Atlanta, then leipzig/athletico
18/07/2020, 21:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Bayern barca will be intesting
18/07/2020, 21:24 - David;: I'd take psg over city. They can be cunts in a league I don't care about
18/07/2020, 21:24 - Rob;: City are leading 2:1 after the first leg against Real
18/07/2020, 21:24 - Hamish Sinclair: If they were both in the final yes.
18/07/2020, 21:24 - David;: Home or away?
18/07/2020, 21:24 - Hamish Sinclair: Yeah so probably throuvh
18/07/2020, 21:24 - Hamish Sinclair: City at home
18/07/2020, 21:25 - Hamish Sinclair: Next leg
18/07/2020, 21:25 - Rob;: Yeah two away goals
18/07/2020, 21:25 - David;: Ah so they have away goals as well
18/07/2020, 21:25 - David;: I completely missed that game somehow
18/07/2020, 21:25 - Hamish Sinclair: From quarter finals on the games are one game knockouts aswell
18/07/2020, 21:26 - David;: That probably suits city
18/07/2020, 21:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Definitely
18/07/2020, 21:26 - Hamish Sinclair: As does not going to intimidating stadiums
18/07/2020, 21:26 - Hamish Sinclair: Athletico for example
18/07/2020, 21:26 - Hamish Sinclair: They tend to lose away in CL

20/07/2020, 21:10 - David;: Makes me keen to avoid ever buying a Samsung. Gone from neutral to having an active dislike for the company.
21/07/2020, 10:59 - Rob;: Cinema's are going to get destroyed for building their entire business models around popcorn. Assuming mandatory masks preclude food and drink sales, as they do in cinemas in China now, they're fucked
21/07/2020, 10:59 - Paul;: Cinemas always cunts anyway
21/07/2020, 10:59 - Damian Rumble: Meh... Cinema pretty much ded anyway.
21/07/2020, 10:59 - Phill: Yeah no sympathy. They are scum.
21/07/2020, 11:00 - Rob;: Odeon last year: turnover £230m, £57m from food and drink, profit £10m. If operating at 30% capacity  due to social distancing, then dead
21/07/2020, 11:01 - Phill: Less overhead though.
21/07/2020, 11:01 - Rob;: Without cunty cinemas, no good films?
21/07/2020, 11:01 - Damian Rumble: Popcorn is shit anyway. They need to change thier business model
21/07/2020, 11:01 - Damian Rumble: Like blockbuster. Sink or swim
21/07/2020, 11:01 - Paul;: You went to the cinema and someone shat themselves next to you. That is the cinema experience
21/07/2020, 11:01 - Rob;: Yeah lol
21/07/2020, 11:02 - Rob;: Row in front to be fair
21/07/2020, 11:02 - Phill: No food or drink costs. Reduced utility bills for kiosks. Make most staff redundant, automated ticket sales anyway
21/07/2020, 11:02 - Phill: Close some cinemas.
21/07/2020, 11:02 - Phill: They will find a way.
21/07/2020, 11:03 - Damian Rumble: Do cinemas even need staff? Automate that shit
21/07/2020, 11:03 - Paul;: What would be better is an even more expensive model but with actually good food and more private seats
21/07/2020, 11:03 - Paul;: Bar service
21/07/2020, 11:03 - Rob;: That's Everyman cinema
21/07/2020, 11:03 - Damian Rumble: I want a T-bone stake with my fast and furious 17
21/07/2020, 11:03 - Rob;: It is great. Got a year's membership for my 30th
21/07/2020, 11:04 - Hamish Sinclair: Lots of films going straight to streaming
21/07/2020, 11:07 - Damian Rumble: Basically you want massive slimed own cinemas with no service where you can go for £2.50 for the masses and then luxury 'everyman' style cinema's for posh waners like Rob where you can get a bottle service and a hand job for the price of a small house
21/07/2020, 11:08 - Damian Rumble: Cinema's done. Next
21/07/2020, 11:08 - Rob;: Let's just destroy the green belt and build massive homes so everyone gets 1 cinema room, two home offices and a garden. No need to leave the house. Eat Huel slurry from taps. No virus risks. World poblems solved.
21/07/2020, 11:08 - Rob;: 'Slimed own cinemas'
21/07/2020, 11:08 - Damian Rumble: *down
21/07/2020, 11:08 - Rob;: And slimmed?
21/07/2020, 11:08 - Jack G;: Posh waners
21/07/2020, 11:09 - Rob;: But the slimmed down cinema with no service removes the profit margin. That's the point. Tickets need to be more expensive if there's no food
21/07/2020, 11:10 - Paul;: that's why we hate the cinema damo - £9 popcorn that costs 20p
21/07/2020, 11:10 - Paul;: not because of their £10 tickets
21/07/2020, 11:11 - Damian Rumble: But you're also not paying some teenager to stand there and getting his pubes in your popcorn
21/07/2020, 11:11 - Rob;: Yeah, but he's keeping the industry afloat
21/07/2020, 11:11 - Paul;: we pay you to harvest data and get pubes in our data
21/07/2020, 11:11 - Rob;: Charge me the amount it costs to show a film and i'll eat beforehand
21/07/2020, 11:11 - Paul;: we don't need that
21/07/2020, 11:12 - Damian Rumble: If your economic model is built on selling popcorn for £9 then we probably deserve Coronavirus
21/07/2020, 11:12 - Paul;: you provide a less tangible / useful service than the popcorn vendor
21/07/2020, 11:12 - Damian Rumble: Yaaas
21/07/2020, 11:13 - Sam;: Some films do be better on the big screen. It do be like that sometimes
21/07/2020, 11:19 - Rob;: Yeah, it's a unique experience. The best films deserve it
21/07/2020, 11:20 - Rob;: Don't ever want to lose it as an option, even if new TVs have a better resolution that most films are made in these days
21/07/2020, 11:21 - Phill: What business charges what is costs?
21/07/2020, 11:22 - Rob;: Well, enough for the business to exist without selling overpriced extras
21/07/2020, 11:23 - Phill: 1) remove all food services
2) make 90% of your staff redundant
3) close unsustainable cinemas in small towns (banbury odeon for example) 
4) increase ticket costs
Profit?
21/07/2020, 11:24 - Rob;: In the short-term probably depends on social distancing. If you're renting a space 70% bigger to account for that, probably not
21/07/2020, 11:25 - Phill: Or include a bag of popcorn in the ticket price and leave them on the seat
21/07/2020, 11:26 - Rob;: Not allowed if people have to wear masks
21/07/2020, 11:26 - / James Ball: Masks with food valves
21/07/2020, 11:26 - Rob;: IV drips for all
21/07/2020, 11:26 - / James Ball: A little food or drink airlock built right into the mask
21/07/2020, 11:28 - Sam;: Have seen this, more of a flap though
21/07/2020, 11:29 - Paul;: need to start consuming via the anus - no virus wants to grow on the anal verge. some kind of suppository food pellet
21/07/2020, 11:30 - / James Ball: Paul says anus = sanitary
21/07/2020, 11:30 - Rob;: What are anal herpes
21/07/2020, 11:32 - Paul;: not seeing any issue here
21/07/2020, 11:33 - Rob;: Do we have to shit out our mouths?
21/07/2020, 11:33 - Phill: Into the mask. A little nappy.
21/07/2020, 11:33 - Paul;: no, you have an auxiliary duct created from the intestine with a new waste anus
21/07/2020, 11:47 - / James Ball: A one way system of anys
21/07/2020, 11:47 - / James Ball: anus
21/07/2020, 11:47 - / James Ball: What is the mouth left for at that point?
21/07/2020, 11:59 - Paul;: That gets blocked up to prevent coronavirus
21/07/2020, 12:00 - Paul;: It gets purposely filled with giant tumours
21/07/2020, 12:03 - Paul;: The perfect system to go to the cinema
21/07/2020, 12:13 - Rob;: Parquetry

21/07/2020, 21:25 - David;: Ah Villa
21/07/2020, 21:25 - David;: Might be a thing still
21/07/2020, 21:28 - Sam;: Down to goal difference. Villa one goal less shit than Watford right now
21/07/2020, 22:08 - David;: Henri Lansbury
21/07/2020, 22:08 - David;: Remember him being massive in FM13
21/07/2020, 22:09 - Rob;: Never really got beyond the Carling cup side for us. Didn't know he was at Villa
21/07/2020, 22:11 - Rob;: 5 years at Forest not bad
21/07/2020, 22:11 - Jack G;: Reckon Villa will stay up now, can’t see us doing much against them on the final day
21/07/2020, 22:18 - David;: Jack, you owe it to the league
21/07/2020, 22:18 - Rob;: So Bournemouth would stay up if they win and Villa and Watford both lose
21/07/2020, 22:18 - Rob;: Good last day
21/07/2020, 22:18 - David;: I for some reason feel very invested in Watford staying up
21/07/2020, 22:19 - Rob;: Jack, if you lose by a lot to United, then Villa beat you, You could go down
21/07/2020, 22:20 - David;: That would be excellent
21/07/2020, 22:20 - Rob;: 5-0 and 4-0 would do it
21/07/2020, 22:20 - Phill: Best teams to go down for me: hammers, villa, norwich
21/07/2020, 22:21 - Rob;: Ah no. It also requires Watford to win 14-0
21/07/2020, 22:21 - David;: It could happen
21/07/2020, 22:22 - Rob;: 9-0 actually, given the 5-0 United thrashing
21/07/2020, 22:27 - David;: David Luiz can make that happen
21/07/2020, 22:28 - David;: Surely you have a duty to be as shit against Watford as you've been against villa, for the integrity of the league
21/07/2020, 22:28 - Rob;: Yeaj
21/07/2020, 22:29 - David;: What was the great line about David Luiz when he re-signed for Chelsea. His 40m move has brought a predictable sense of chaos to the back 4
21/07/2020, 22:29 - Rob;: We can only wind matches when completely under the kosh
21/07/2020, 22:29 - Rob;: Yeah
21/07/2020, 22:29 - David;: I just love that. Everyone knows what they are getting but they can't help themselves
21/07/2020, 22:29 - David;: Each time they buy into the myth
21/07/2020, 22:31 - Rob;: It's just Kia Joorabchian. Has made a fortune selling people ~monorails~ David Luiz's
21/07/2020, 22:38 - David;: What does that even mean
21/07/2020, 22:38 - Rob;: He's that super agent
21/07/2020, 22:39 - Rob;: Made millions and millions, often making sure shit players get big moves
21/07/2020, 22:40 - Rob;: He's conned us, Chelsea X2 and PSG into David Luiz and made millions out of it
21/07/2020, 22:41 - David;: What sort of a name is joorabchian
21/07/2020, 22:43 - Rob;: An Iranian one
21/07/2020, 22:43 - Rob;: Apparently
21/07/2020, 22:43 - Rob;: Although he is British
21/07/2020, 22:44 - Rob;: He was the guy who owned Tevez and Mascherano as a third party
21/07/2020, 22:44 - Rob;: Like a weird sort of slave owner who loans his slaves to West Ham
21/07/2020, 22:46 - David;: A very specific sort of modern slavery localised entirely around West Ham
21/07/2020, 22:51 - Rob;: My name is Maximus Decimis Meridius, commander of the armies of the North, father to a murdered son, husband to a murdered wife, and I will keep West Ham up, in this life or the next
21/07/2020, 23:00 - David;: Wouldn't they be wanting to relegate west ham in that context?

22/07/2020, 00:20 - Paul;: The perfect bloot occasion

22/07/2020, 19:30 - David;: So the United Leicester game is huge
22/07/2020, 19:31 - Sam;: Uuuge.
22/07/2020, 19:31 - David;: If Leicester win they come in top 4
22/07/2020, 19:31 - David;: And United would be out unless Chelsea fuck up
22/07/2020, 19:31 - Sam;: Especially if Chelsea pull a sneaky against pool tonight
22/07/2020, 19:32 - David;: Yeah but their next game is vs wolves which you'd still expect them to win with 4th at stake
22/07/2020, 19:32 - David;: Sheffield now can't get I to Europe?
22/07/2020, 19:32 - Sam;: Wolves still got Europa league to secure
22/07/2020, 19:33 - Sam;: No Sheffield plate out of it
22/07/2020, 19:33 - David;: How far does EL places go down?
22/07/2020, 19:33 - David;: The dream is dead
22/07/2020, 19:34 - Sam;: Probably fir the best, surely couldn’t handle a run in Europe.
22/07/2020, 19:34 - Rob;: The commemorative Sheffield United in the Europa League plate smashed
22/07/2020, 19:34 - David;: Would have been amazing to see them try to deal with that
22/07/2020, 19:34 - Sam;: I think it’s down to 7th but is that only if fa cup winner is already in Europe?
22/07/2020, 19:35 - David;: Is the europa league still going to be finished this year?
22/07/2020, 19:35 - David;: Could an English team win it and grot out another place for us?
22/07/2020, 19:36 - Sam;: Yeah, Europa taking place in August. Man U and Wolves still in
22/07/2020, 19:37 - David;: Right so Wolves win it but have also qualified via league position hence it goes down to Sheffield. Done
22/07/2020, 19:37 - David;: Next.
22/07/2020, 19:38 - David;: The dream is alive
22/07/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: If Chelsea win the FA cup, another place goes to the league I think
22/07/2020, 19:39 - Sam;: Yarp
22/07/2020, 19:39 - Rob;: And as City won the league cup, are there two places already?
22/07/2020, 19:40 - Jack G;: There’s a great scenario where spurs finish 7th but Arsenal with the FA cup to deny them europe
22/07/2020, 19:40 - David;: Hiib
22/07/2020, 19:40 - Rob;: The opposite will happen Jack and it won't be fun
22/07/2020, 19:41 - David;: So how low could it theoretically go down to
22/07/2020, 19:41 - David;: E.g. wolves win the EL, city have won the league cup, Chelsea win the FA.
22/07/2020, 19:41 - Rob;: One year Fulham got in by being the most well behaved team in Europe
22/07/2020, 19:41 - Rob;: Do they still have a fair play place?
22/07/2020, 19:42 - Jack G;: Is that the year when they beat Juventus. Legendary
22/07/2020, 19:42 - Sam;: Ah yeah, city’s League cup place has gone to 6th place team now
22/07/2020, 19:42 - David;: We've got places falling out of our arsehole
22/07/2020, 19:42 - Rob;: So 8th is the realistic lowest
22/07/2020, 19:43 - David;: Yeah of Chelsea win cup and United/wolves win it I think it should be 8th
22/07/2020, 19:43 - David;: Barring some troll rule we've missed
22/07/2020, 19:44 - Rob;: I know the financial and transfer be target argument is in favour of getting in, and I do enjoy the cheap, easy to come by tickets, I would be completely fine with Arsenal not qualifying for a year
22/07/2020, 19:44 - David;: Helps develop the squad by having more games
22/07/2020, 19:45 - David;: But trolls hard with the Sunday games
22/07/2020, 19:46 - Sam;: Nice to focus though. Players doing well in Europa never really tells you if they’re any good. Until knockout rounds
22/07/2020, 19:48 - Rob;: Yeah, feel like the focus would be good
22/07/2020, 19:48 - David;: The year we got back into top 4 was the year after we failed to get into europa league
22/07/2020, 19:49 - David;: Which was also the same season we got to the final
22/07/2020, 19:49 - David;: Then year after that we got to CL final, in first year back.
22/07/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: Yeah, that was when you got top 4 on the last day when we were in Wales, having been behind most of the match
22/07/2020, 19:51 - Rob;: We would have qualified if you hadn't won. The different directions the club's have gone in since then...
22/07/2020, 19:54 - David;: Yeah
22/07/2020, 19:54 - David;: Weren't we playing Middleborough though?
22/07/2020, 19:54 - David;: Don't think we were playing arsenal
22/07/2020, 19:55 - Jack G;: Lovely little draw. Means we can freely donate 3 points to Villa on Sunday
22/07/2020, 19:55 - Sam;: Chelsea always find a shitty little way. You have to beat them tonight
22/07/2020, 19:55 - Rob;: Yeah, we just would behave been the beneficiaries of you not winning
22/07/2020, 19:56 - Jack G;: You can’t be rooting for PEADOpool can you?
22/07/2020, 19:56 - David;: We'll be up for it. Chelsea are cunts, there's history there
22/07/2020, 19:57 - David;: But it doesn't fully bail you out
22/07/2020, 19:57 - David;: I think you're going to need a draw or better vs Leicester whatever?
22/07/2020, 19:59 - Sam;: United to defeat evil. PEADOPOOL are long standing rivals but Chelsea is an evil that must be defeated
22/07/2020, 20:00 - Jack G;: If Leicester and Chelsea both win on the final day (regardless of the result tonight) then United are out
22/07/2020, 20:02 - Sam;: Yeah but if Chelsea win they’re definitely in
22/07/2020, 20:05 - Jack G;: Either way, United Leicester is massive, only choice of match to watch on Sunday
22/07/2020, 20:07 - David;: Yeah, that plus wolves Chelsea and Watford Arse are the games to watch
22/07/2020, 20:08 - David;: This game would make a difference if Chelsea also lose vs wolves as then United could lose and still qualify on goal difference
22/07/2020, 20:08 - Sam;: My ass will be twitching on the bench
22/07/2020, 20:08 - David;: And I don't like that
22/07/2020, 20:09 - David;: Ah I do miss van gaal's insanity
22/07/2020, 20:09 - Rob;: Yeah same
22/07/2020, 20:09 - David;: He had no idea where or who he was at least 50% of the time
22/07/2020, 20:09 - Rob;: Like a Spitting Image Dutch version of Hodgeson
22/07/2020, 20:11 - Rob;: The immortal Louis Van Gaal's red army moment 
https://youtu.be/kL1mocfrT3Q
22/07/2020, 20:11 - Sam;: Called Smalling ‘Mike’ in two different press conferences
22/07/2020, 20:12 - Sam;: With smalling sat next to him
22/07/2020, 20:13 - Rob;: Gets the chant wrong in this press conference https://youtu.be/pWl64D078kA
22/07/2020, 20:15 - David;: He couldn't seem to get close to anything
22/07/2020, 20:15 - David;: Never really had a handle on it
22/07/2020, 20:16 - David;: Referring to himself in 3rd person as well
22/07/2020, 20:17 - Rob;: Is the twitching my ass thing him getting Fergie's squeaky bum time wrong as well
22/07/2020, 20:17 - David;: Unrelated I believe
22/07/2020, 20:19 - Sam;: Yeah Unrelated. Just a tense end to a game. “Me and Ryan were twitching our asses on the bench. We are all twitching our asses in the bench”
22/07/2020, 20:20 - David;: Then returned to it later. 'i was always twitching my ass. And I don't like it'
22/07/2020, 20:21 - Sam;: https://youtu.be/6RNxSqs4UM0
22/07/2020, 20:22 - Rob;: So he's had squeezing corrected to twitching
22/07/2020, 20:22 - Rob;: Still nonsense after heavy editing
22/07/2020, 20:23 - Sam;: So there was a moment where he told the dressing room that he was squeezing his ass on the bench.
22/07/2020, 20:23 - Rob;: Football managers are just such an excellent type of famous person. So many weird habits
22/07/2020, 20:25 - David;: There's so little information content in the original source that there's no way of processing it into anything coherent
22/07/2020, 20:25 - David;: Also good moment when he was telling them all to be horny
22/07/2020, 20:25 - Sam;: Felix Magath is one to look into. His time at Fulham.
22/07/2020, 20:25 - David;: Yeah he was a weird little fella
22/07/2020, 20:25 - Rob;: The glasses man?
22/07/2020, 20:26 - David;: Looked like a badger type creature
22/07/2020, 20:26 - David;: Hoping bielsa will bring comedy moments
22/07/2020, 20:26 - Rob;: I love all the Pardew stories
22/07/2020, 20:26 - Rob;: Eating his players' dinner to establish dominance
22/07/2020, 20:27 - Sam;: https://youtu.be/aS0umv1XcJg
22/07/2020, 20:27 - Sam;: Original use of horny here
22/07/2020, 20:27 - Sam;: Mata mocking him as well.
22/07/2020, 20:28 - Sam;: Doesn’t understand why horny is a ridiculous word to use
22/07/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: Ah that's brilliant
22/07/2020, 20:28 - David;: Listening again I can only assume he meant clenching
22/07/2020, 20:28 - Rob;: Annoyed by the laughter
22/07/2020, 20:30 - David;: Can't comprehend why that is hillarious
22/07/2020, 20:32 - Sam;: Yeah nerves. The lack of balance on the pitch makes him nervous
22/07/2020, 20:32 - Sam;: But critically, that’s not what he said
22/07/2020, 20:32 - Sam;: As a communicator
22/07/2020, 20:32 - Rob;: What I like is his confidence to say words
22/07/2020, 20:33 - Sam;: Yeah, we’re the mental ones for laughing
22/07/2020, 20:33 - Rob;: A confident, fundamentally incorrect user of English
22/07/2020, 20:33 - Rob;: Eager to find the right word and appreciative of different meanings, but always wrong
22/07/2020, 20:34 - Sam;: He goes for very risky phrases though. Horny, ass twitching. He said something about S&M in one press conference as well
22/07/2020, 20:38 - Sam;: Dat goal
22/07/2020, 20:38 - David;: Fuck me
22/07/2020, 20:38 - David;: Do I like that
22/07/2020, 20:39 - David;: Always love a goal frame
22/07/2020, 20:40 - David;: Lol in the fan reaction screen 75% were completely unresponsive
22/07/2020, 20:41 - David;: Assume must have badly  synched streams
22/07/2020, 20:42 - Sam;: https://youtu.be/a7N6riG8_Mo
22/07/2020, 20:42 - Sam;: From 3.20
22/07/2020, 20:42 - Sam;: The S&M remark. No need
22/07/2020, 20:43 - Rob;: This always seems to be the case. It's brilliant
22/07/2020, 20:45 - David;: Ironically manages to such excitement out of the goal
22/07/2020, 20:45 - David;: Opposite of it's intended function
22/07/2020, 20:45 - David;: *suck
22/07/2020, 20:45 - Rob;: I really love it. Everyone looks so bored
22/07/2020, 20:47 - David;: Yeah one of the girls looks like she wasn't watching the game but reading WhatsApp or something
22/07/2020, 20:48 - David;: Assuming that the use of sexual terms in a foreign language in a professional context carries no risk
22/07/2020, 20:48 - Sam;: That offside fir mounts goal shows them at there’s no point in linesmen are pointless now. Just VAR afterwards or refs whistle
22/07/2020, 20:53 - David;: Dem goals
22/07/2020, 20:55 - David;: How do Chelsea not qualify?
22/07/2020, 20:55 - David;: That would be great
22/07/2020, 20:56 - Jack G;: Lose to Wolves
22/07/2020, 20:56 - Jack G;: United Leicester draw
22/07/2020, 20:56 - Jack G;: Not unimaginable
22/07/2020, 20:56 - Rob;: Or lose to wolves and Leicester win
22/07/2020, 20:57 - Jack G;: Even more possible then
22/07/2020, 20:57 - Rob;: Unless Leicester win 8-0
22/07/2020, 21:01 - David;: Leicester wank since locky though
22/07/2020, 21:34 - Rob;: <Media omitted>
22/07/2020, 21:35 - Sam;: 3rd vs 6th
22/07/2020, 21:36 - Sam;: 4th vs 5th
22/07/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: Steve's mate from uni is Brentford's communications manager
22/07/2020, 21:38 - Rob;: Known as Caveman to his friends
22/07/2020, 21:39 - Sam;: Only uses cave paintings
22/07/2020, 21:39 - Rob;: Yeah yeah. It's revolutionised the club
22/07/2020, 21:40 - Jack G;: Gutted that forest missed out
22/07/2020, 21:40 - Sam;: Dave. Are you pleased that Curtis Jones Will now get a medal having played tonight?
22/07/2020, 21:40 - Sam;: The boy got themselves to blame by losing 4-1 tonight
22/07/2020, 21:46 - Sam;: Fuck sake. Very Chelsea
22/07/2020, 21:46 - Sam;: Find a way
22/07/2020, 21:48 - David;: Happy for the boy
22/07/2020, 21:49 - Hamish Sinclair: The fairytale ending
22/07/2020, 21:49 - Sam;: The boy Jones
22/07/2020, 21:49 - Hamish Sinclair: We go jones
22/07/2020, 21:54 - David;: He runs from his knees
22/07/2020, 21:55 - Sam;: Athletes don’t run from there knees
22/07/2020, 21:55 - Sam;: They run from their hips
22/07/2020, 21:55 - Sam;: Dem fireworks
22/07/2020, 21:56 - Sam;: Is it over the Kop?
22/07/2020, 21:56 - Jack G;: Knees are irrelevant
22/07/2020, 21:56 - David;: Good to have fireworks off the TV angle to an empty stadium
22/07/2020, 21:56 - David;: Really worth the cash
22/07/2020, 21:57 - David;: It's the sound you come for with fireworks
22/07/2020, 21:58 - David;: This particular game
22/07/2020, 21:58 - David;: That particular goal
22/07/2020, 21:59 - David;: This is like watching early Klopp again
22/07/2020, 22:01 - Sam;: What was the phrase? Heavy metal football?
22/07/2020, 22:04 - Hamish Sinclair: I'd be disappointed if we didn't win this by a one goal margin
22/07/2020, 22:04 - David;: Yeah yeah
22/07/2020, 22:05 - Sam;: Nothing beats that Europa league game against Dortmund.
22/07/2020, 22:07 - David;: Yeah. My shirt was off. Didn't know what life was
22/07/2020, 22:07 - David;: Second only after the Barca semi for me
22/07/2020, 22:10 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
22/07/2020, 22:11 - David;: Would Fergie concede the boy Henderson has done alright? The knees don't seem to have held him back
22/07/2020, 22:12 - David;: Yeah. 30 mins to score 3 goals and conceding any fucks you.
22/07/2020, 22:13 - Sam;: He’d have to concede the knees were not an issue.
22/07/2020, 22:14 - Jack G;: England midfield of hendo, rice, grealish would be great. Dat work rate and leadership
22/07/2020, 22:15 - David;: Yeah decent. No Ox or maddison?
22/07/2020, 22:15 - Sam;: I’m quite excited to see where Dortmund tale Bellingham to as well
22/07/2020, 22:15 - Sam;: Don’t need hendo and rice in the same team
22/07/2020, 22:15 - Rob;: I loved that Everton draw in the pub near your Hammersmith flat when you were on the floor suddenly
22/07/2020, 22:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Dortmund at the time was mind blowing
22/07/2020, 22:15 - Hamish Sinclair: Out of body experience
22/07/2020, 22:16 - David;: Yeah. At that point it seemed like we would beat Sevilla as well so felt massive.
22/07/2020, 22:17 - Rob;: I was on the floor miles from where I started after Arshavin against Barcelona. No one in that pub had a pint left
22/07/2020, 22:17 - Sam;: Albert shartreno
22/07/2020, 22:17 - David;: You can't stand up through that. Not viable
22/07/2020, 22:18 - Hamish Sinclair: Completely lost the use of his legs
22/07/2020, 22:18 - Jack G;: Maddison can start, bring on rice if we need to defend a lead in second half
22/07/2020, 22:18 - Rob;: Good moment in a Celtic pub with Steve when they grottily beat Barca. Bounced so hard it vibrated the skycard out of the box and everyone started booing
22/07/2020, 22:18 - Hamish Sinclair: But crucially top and trousers remained on
22/07/2020, 22:19 - Sam;: You can’t replicate that. Too big. Bounced the card out
22/07/2020, 22:20 - Rob;: It was mental. It was interesting being there as a relatively neutral observer. Was able to see people really lose it with a clear head.
22/07/2020, 22:21 - David;: What was the context? Group stage?
22/07/2020, 22:23 - Rob;: Yeah 
Celtic 2-1 Barcelona - http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/20150451
22/07/2020, 22:24 - David;: The Tony watt goal seal the fate of the sky box?
22/07/2020, 22:24 - David;: *sealed
22/07/2020, 22:24 - Rob;: Yeah. Watty did for that
22/07/2020, 22:25 - Rob;: Barman has to climb up on a chair to get it back in. Everyone jeering him as he tries to help them
22/07/2020, 22:33 - Sam;: They’ve done well here to make the trophy presentation good with no fans
22/07/2020, 22:34 - David;: Big light show
22/07/2020, 22:34 - Sam;: With no fans they could make the stage uuge
22/07/2020, 22:34 - Sam;: Klopp in A shirt
22/07/2020, 22:34 - Rob;: Wish Dalglish had turned up in his Suarez isn't Racist T-shirt
22/07/2020, 22:36 - Sam;: The non medal players first
22/07/2020, 22:36 - Sam;: Savage
22/07/2020, 22:36 - David;: Lol. Very edgy gag
22/07/2020, 22:37 - Paul;: Maupay you’re a cheat and I hope Brighton get relegated
22/07/2020, 22:37 - Rob;: Would anyone really care if they just gave all the players who had an appearance a medal?
22/07/2020, 22:37 - David;: Lol Adrian lives at carras
22/07/2020, 22:38 - Sam;: The sunglasses coming out as well
22/07/2020, 22:38 - David;: Just a great bunch of lads
22/07/2020, 22:39 - Paul;: Are they bringing out all the kids they stole?
22/07/2020, 22:40 - Rob;: Everyone's having Oxo on an orange for their tea in celebration
22/07/2020, 22:40 - David;: Ginis having a shocker. Filming it all on his phone
22/07/2020, 22:45 - Rob;: Declare it null and void I say. There's still time.
22/07/2020, 22:45 - Sam;: The kop is lit
22/07/2020, 22:45 - Rob;: No reason not to make it this good when there are fans there
22/07/2020, 22:46 - Paul;: Worst title win in history
22/07/2020, 22:46 - David;: Lol klopp gurning and hibbing
22/07/2020, 22:47 - Rob;: Is there anyone actually standing in front of them?
22/07/2020, 22:47 - David;: He fully commits to the hib
22/07/2020, 22:47 - Rob;: Have the people on fan cam even noticed this is happening yet?
22/07/2020, 22:50 - Phill: Klopp rolling
22/07/2020, 22:51 - Rob;: Love it when Muslim players have to run away from Champagne
22/07/2020, 22:53 - Sam;: My favourite thing. A drop will sully them
22/07/2020, 22:54 - Phill: Like spraying slurry around in a nightclub
22/07/2020, 22:54 - David;: 'we haven't yet told you about the other tradition where we spray gammon and bacon grease everywhere'
22/07/2020, 22:55 - Rob;: Here's your commemorative drawing of Mohammed, guys
22/07/2020, 22:55 - Paul;: Lol
22/07/2020, 22:55 - David;: We thought that's the thing you'd appreciate most
22/07/2020, 22:55 - Sam;: I need to see a tear from Kenny
22/07/2020, 22:56 - David;: Daft punk
22/07/2020, 22:59 - Sam;: Klopp
22/07/2020, 22:59 - Sam;: The daft py
22/07/2020, 22:59 - Sam;: Punk
22/07/2020, 23:01 - David;: Klopp slams coronavirus
22/07/2020, 23:02 - David;: 'prepare for a party when all this bullshit's over'
22/07/2020, 23:07 - Sam;: Lol, yeah. MAXIMUM PARTY TATZEN
22/07/2020, 23:33 - Damian Rumble: Just making my final transfers of the year only to discover I have a wildcard left some how...
23/07/2020, 09:01 - Damian Rumble: Burgh... Having west brom back in the premiership is going to be an absolute ball ache

23/07/2020, 11:09 - David;: This message was deleted
23/07/2020, 12:16 - David;: Revisiting the Prince Andrew interview.
23/07/2020, 12:16 - David;: So glad that happened. "I didn't sweat at the time"
23/07/2020, 12:19 - Rob;: I wish they hadn't stopped him doing a second to clear up the first one
23/07/2020, 12:23 - David;: This message was deleted

23/07/2020, 12:27 - Rob;: Too honourable
23/07/2020, 12:28 - David;: Yeah, it's all too good
23/07/2020, 12:28 - David;: 'just a straightforward shooting weekend'
23/07/2020, 12:29 - David;: Trying to link it to the falkland's war as well.
23/07/2020, 12:29 - David;: 'It can't be me in London because when I'm in London I wear a suit'
23/07/2020, 12:30 - Rob;: In the years when he wasn't sweating, did he have to cool down with his tongue out like a dog?
23/07/2020, 12:32 - David;: I think the idea that adrenalin overdose could do that was immediately debunked
23/07/2020, 12:32 - Rob;: The 'four times a year!?' overreaction is brilliant too.
23/07/2020, 12:33 - David;: Yeah, I think a lot of what's great is not just what he says but how it's so transparently unconvincing.
23/07/2020, 12:33 - David;: He's a terrible liar
23/07/2020, 12:34 - David;: Has the air of someone completely winging it
23/07/2020, 12:35 - Rob;: Yeah, andalso an air that he is used to being believed and that this is going brilliantly
23/07/2020, 12:37 - David;: Yeah you feel he walked out of that thinking he'd put the matter to bed
23/07/2020, 12:38 - Rob;: Feels like he really came across rather normal and relatable
23/07/2020, 15:49 - David;: Big last week in Jules Chippet
23/07/2020, 15:50 - David;: The grandstand finish
23/07/2020, 15:52 - Rob;: I need bench boost to work unprecedentedly well
23/07/2020, 15:55 - Rob;: Hamish has got to be sending spies round to Phil's so he can match his team like for like
23/07/2020, 15:55 - Rob;: Bribe Becca for information
23/07/2020, 16:10 - Damian Rumble: Didn't you have an archive of Jules chippet history? Would be good to know when/if there's ever been a closer season
23/07/2020, 16:10 - Damian Rumble: Personally I feel like I have more points than I normally would at this time of year
23/07/2020, 16:22 - David;: Anyone know a cheap way of getting phone screens repaired or getting cheap unlocked handsets? Cracked mine dodgy phone shop in Leam is quoting £55 to repair. Seems at that price I might as well just get a new one.
23/07/2020, 16:25 - Sam;: What model phone is it?
23/07/2020, 16:25 - David;: Motorola something or other
23/07/2020, 16:26 - Sam;: How hold is it? If it’s up to about 2/3 years old then 55 sounds about right
23/07/2020, 16:26 - David;: They were offering to flog me something called a samsung galaxy A10s for 130 quid.
23/07/2020, 16:26 - David;: No idea if that's a good phone or good price for that phone
23/07/2020, 16:27 - David;: I bought it about 18 months ago but was fairly cheap so might have been a 1-2 year old model already at that point
23/07/2020, 16:27 - David;: Been decent. But just seems if getting a new one is only about twice as expensive as getting the screen fixed might as well go with that.
23/07/2020, 16:28 - Sam;: Are you in a contract or not?
23/07/2020, 16:30 - David;: Presume so. Money leaves my account and I get data in return
23/07/2020, 16:30 - David;: But I think I can put the sim into another phone.
23/07/2020, 16:31 - Sam;: Find out if you’re on a contract, might be due an upgrade, they’re usually offered 3/4 of the way through a contract
23/07/2020, 16:37 - David;: <Media omitted>
23/07/2020, 16:40 - David;: Needs updating. Phil never supplied data and need to add the 18/19 season scores
23/07/2020, 16:43 - David;: Actually seems like I can get it through the app.
23/07/2020, 16:43 - Sam;: That’s the spirit. What provider?
23/07/2020, 16:47 - David;: ah no I was talking about FF data. My provider is Three.
23/07/2020, 16:50 - Sam;: Lol
23/07/2020, 16:52 - David;: Phil mysteriously lacks data for the 13/14 season
23/07/2020, 17:05 - Paul;: He didn’t play a season I think? Missed the start of it
23/07/2020, 17:19 - David;: <Media omitted>
23/07/2020, 17:20 - Damian Rumble: Jesus
23/07/2020, 17:21 - David;: Season before last, which was 17/18, was also a very close three way title race.
23/07/2020, 17:21 - David;: 36 points seperating Rob, Damo and me
23/07/2020, 17:22 - Rob;: That broke my empire
23/07/2020, 17:22 - Rob;: That and long term relationship
23/07/2020, 17:22 - David;: Paul only wins shitty low scoring years.
23/07/2020, 17:22 - David;: The two lowest title winning scores are both of his titles
23/07/2020, 17:23 - David;: Yeah my fallow years also map precisely onto first 2 years of our relationship
23/07/2020, 17:24 - Rob;: The early stages particularly. 'sure this is my first time staying over and I'd love to go to brunch, but I need to plan this Free Hit before 11:30, alright'
23/07/2020, 17:31 - David;: <Media omitted>

23/07/2020, 20:08 - Rob;: I have a week alone in the house next week. Obviously I'll be shitting with the door open, so no need to suggest that, but any recommendations for things to entertain myself? Flms, TV series to really grot down into
23/07/2020, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: The Expanse
23/07/2020, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
23/07/2020, 20:13 - Damian Rumble: On prime
23/07/2020, 20:38 - Rob;: Ah yeah. Mars.
23/07/2020, 20:42 - David;: Whats this?
23/07/2020, 20:44 - David;: I've been enjoying miracle workers: dark ages. Python-esque historical comedy set in middle ages. Featuring Radcliffe. Buscemi (weird little fella who was in the big lebowski).
23/07/2020, 20:44 - Damian Rumble: https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3230854/
23/07/2020, 20:44 - Damian Rumble: The best sci fi of the last 5 years
23/07/2020, 20:44 - David;: Dead Souls on switch.
23/07/2020, 20:48 - David;: Also featuring Peter Serafinowich a.k.a butterfield
23/07/2020, 20:48 - David;: They really go in for a gag.
23/07/2020, 20:49 - David;: <Media omitted>
23/07/2020, 20:56 - David;: <Media omitted>
23/07/2020, 20:57 - David;: Entered league position as well as points into the spready to smooth out differences in overall points in different years.
23/07/2020, 20:58 - David;: And allowed me to calculate mean league position over the entire history.
23/07/2020, 21:00 - Sam;: Dave I need an in depth documentary covering your fall and rise in years 7 to 11.
23/07/2020, 21:05 - David;: It was like Fergie's transitional period in the early 2000s. I was building my 3rd team. Rob's teams of the mid-2010s had taken the sports science and dieting aspects of the game to a new level.
23/07/2020, 21:13 - David;: Also, I failed to scout Vardy or Leicester players early enough in their title winning season. Fatal error.
23/07/2020, 21:20 - Sam;: Damian, your perfectly incremental rise between 8 - 11. The boy
23/07/2020, 21:20 - Sam;: Bot
23/07/2020, 21:25 - David;: Damo manages to be very consistent while rarely winning the title. Low volatility data management
23/07/2020, 21:27 - Sam;: Paul is Chelsea. Boom and bust. 1st to 6th. 1st to 7th.
23/07/2020, 21:28 - David;: Yeah big boom and bust. Won 2 titles yet often finishes almost last.
23/07/2020, 21:28 - David;: Also doesn't remember winning one of those titles
23/07/2020, 21:31 - Damian Rumble: Year 8 was a real anomaly. Paul, Phil and Jack top 3 despite normally being the bottom feeders. The jews
23/07/2020, 21:43 - Rob;: THE Steve Buscemi
23/07/2020, 22:12 - David;: Yeah.
23/07/2020, 22:13 - David;: Plays a peasant who shovels shit
23/07/2020, 22:13 - David;: It's gag after gag
24/07/2020, 00:46 - David;: https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/jul/21/donald-trump-cognitive-test-closer-look
24/07/2020, 00:47 - David;: This is great. 'Nasreddine stressed that the test “is supposed to be easy for someone who has no cognitive impairment...The test is supposed to help physicians detect early signs of Alzheimer’s.”'
24/07/2020, 00:48 - David;: So he took a test you're only supposed to struggle with if you have onset dementia and claiming the last few questions are very hard. And then boasting about passing it.
24/07/2020, 07:50 - Hamish Sinclair: There's a great bit in the fox news interview where the interviewer points out one of the questions is naming an elephant
24/07/2020, 08:01 - Rob;: I like in the bottom of that article that they mention that someone has been adding up all the glass or misleading things Trump has said as president
24/07/2020, 08:01 - Rob;: 22,000 so far
24/07/2020, 08:01 - Rob;: They should publish them as a book when his presidency ends
24/07/2020, 10:17 - Paul;: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 10:20 - Rob;: He's only a year younger than us, would definitely have been taught to read a clock
24/07/2020, 10:21 - Paul;: Do the zoomers know how to read clocks
24/07/2020, 10:21 - Phill: >clocks
24/07/2020, 10:22 - Phill: Time is just a social construct to control you anway.
24/07/2020, 10:27 - Rob;: Feel like they did a good job arbitrarily dividing time into units. An hour is a good unit in which to get something done
24/07/2020, 10:27 - Rob;: Fan of the minute
24/07/2020, 10:28 - Rob;: Seconds, easy to count
24/07/2020, 10:29 - Rob;: Months are a shitstorm
24/07/2020, 10:29 - Phill: Yeah why not just have same amount of days oer month
24/07/2020, 10:29 - Rob;: And weeks seen completely made up. No relationship to the months or year they make up
24/07/2020, 10:30 - Rob;: 73 five day weeks a year is the easiest division
24/07/2020, 10:31 - Rob;: But prime number so months cannot also work
24/07/2020, 10:34 - Rob;: We should invest in pushing the earth slightly closer to the sun so we can have 360 day years, with 12 months of 30 days and 60 weeks of 6 days
24/07/2020, 10:34 - Rob;: Keep two day weekends and work less
24/07/2020, 10:36 - Stefan;: A week is a quarter of a lunar cycle, isn't it? 28 days
24/07/2020, 10:36 - Rob;: Only approximately
24/07/2020, 10:37 - Rob;: Lunar phase is 29.5 days
24/07/2020, 10:37 - Stefan;: Ah didn't know that
24/07/2020, 10:38 - Rob;: I mean nor did I, but Google did
24/07/2020, 10:39 - Stefan;: So I suppose the ancients just thought a day off every 7 days was enough for them
24/07/2020, 11:30 - David;: Disagree. Think 45 minute units would be better. 45 minutes is a little task like cooking a meal, going for run. 2 = 90 minutes is something you can really sink into. A film, a footy game.
24/07/2020, 11:31 - Damian Rumble: I'm always a bit butt hurt that we don't have decimal time. 1984 style
24/07/2020, 11:32 - Rob;: Get out
24/07/2020, 11:32 - David;: An hour, what am I doing with that. Neither here nor there
24/07/2020, 11:32 - Rob;: It's perfect
24/07/2020, 11:33 - Rob;: Films obviously fit just as often into two hours as they do 90 mins
24/07/2020, 11:34 - Rob;: And football games have half time and injury time. Always closer to two hours of your time taken
24/07/2020, 11:34 - Jack G;: Also plenty of things you can get done in half an hour, fitting two tasks into an hour. What are you getting done in 22.5 minutes?
24/07/2020, 11:39 - Paul;: Numbers are all wrong. We need base 12. Done. Next
24/07/2020, 11:54 - David;: Nah, everything relevant takes 45 minutes
24/07/2020, 11:54 - David;: Or 1hr 30
24/07/2020, 11:57 - Rob;: Women's 45 Minutes
24/07/2020, 11:57 - Rob;: The Witching 90 minutes
24/07/2020, 11:59 - / James Ball: Problem is you will always want to subdivide it, whatever you have
24/07/2020, 11:59 - Rob;: No, James. This is a serious conversation where we've going to find the perfect solution.
24/07/2020, 12:03 - / James Ball: Paul, what digits do you want to represent 10 and 11 in your base 12 system?
24/07/2020, 12:03 - / James Ball: 12 o'clock would be 10 btw
24/07/2020, 12:18 - Jack G;: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 12:34 - Phill: Rakheem Cornwall
24/07/2020, 12:34 - Phill: Heaviest player in test history at 143kg
24/07/2020, 12:38 - Jack G;: Should get some hefty revs on the ball with that weight
24/07/2020, 13:03 - David;: Wearing masks is very shit
24/07/2020, 13:09 - Sam;: 20 minutes is maximum manageable before air break needed
24/07/2020, 13:17 - David;: Steams up the old specs
24/07/2020, 13:18 - David;: Everyone looking like Hannibal lecter
24/07/2020, 13:18 - David;: It's just a big downgrade
24/07/2020, 13:18 - Phill: Ive heard smearing shit on your lenses really helps with that
24/07/2020, 13:23 - David;: That would raise bigger problems than the one it solves
24/07/2020, 13:26 - David;: It ruins the retail experience
24/07/2020, 13:26 - David;: Not viable long term
24/07/2020, 14:00 - David;: How long before people are filling herbs into the masks to form plague beaks?
24/07/2020, 14:02 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 14:04 - David;: This is the vibe we need to move towards.
24/07/2020, 14:05 - Rob;: You do have those glasses
24/07/2020, 14:05 - Rob;: I just went to Wickes. So many people who remove their masks once inside
24/07/2020, 14:05 - David;: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 14:06 - Rob;: There is a guy wandering around Crouch End in one of those plague doctor outfits
24/07/2020, 14:06 - David;: Ah good
24/07/2020, 14:07 - David;: What sort of reception is he getting?
24/07/2020, 14:07 - Rob;: https://www.hamhigh.co.uk/news/crouch-end-plague-doctor-spotted-again-outside-newsagent-1-6643064
24/07/2020, 14:09 - Stefan;: These cunts who just wear it around their necks, like a magic talisman
24/07/2020, 14:12 - David;: The thing is everyone seems to have stopped social distancing.
24/07/2020, 14:12 - David;: Can't we just keep distancing and not do the masks
24/07/2020, 14:13 - Rob;: Is it officially 1m not 2m now?
24/07/2020, 14:14 - Rob;: I'm fine with putting up with the mask. Can accept the inconvenience
24/07/2020, 14:29 - David;: Our uni were trying to suggest us all lecturing in masks at one point. Had to be pointed out that that was mental
24/07/2020, 14:51 - Sam;: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 14:56 - Damian Rumble: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 14:57 - Paul;: @447875303402 I imagine the stats applied to humans are nothing shocking and nothing you haven't seen before?
24/07/2020, 15:02 - Sam;: Have broken toilet bowls before now
24/07/2020, 15:17 - David;: Lol this bowler
24/07/2020, 15:17 - David;: Just taken a catch
24/07/2020, 15:18 - David;: So 6 weeks off still. Not too different from a normal summer?
24/07/2020, 15:19 - Rob;: But with the champions league tourney
24/07/2020, 15:19 - Rob;: And the FA final
24/07/2020, 15:20 - Rob;: So more like 4 off I guess
24/07/2020, 15:27 - Hamish Sinclair: I appreciate this
24/07/2020, 15:28 - Hamish Sinclair: Always good to know the exact pressure of a penguins anus
24/07/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: it's like that snippet of information we had of what shape a dog would be in a 4 dimensional world
24/07/2020, 15:31 - Paul;: here it is
24/07/2020, 15:48 - David;: How does transfer window work now?
24/07/2020, 15:48 - David;: Does it just go from end of season to the start
24/07/2020, 16:30 - Damian Rumble: Nations league as well
24/07/2020, 18:07 - Phill: LOL
24/07/2020, 18:07 - Phill: Just got to mine
24/07/2020, 18:07 - Phill: My brother has this:

24/07/2020, 18:09 - / James Ball: lol
24/07/2020, 18:09 - Hamish Sinclair: Why chew when you can slurp
24/07/2020, 18:10 - / James Ball: protein slurry
24/07/2020, 18:12 - Sam;: Stella and huel
24/07/2020, 18:12 - Rob;: Your brother was always very lithe and wiry. Has this bulked him up?
24/07/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Nah hes ripped now
24/07/2020, 18:13 - Phill: Hes been doing weights for two years
24/07/2020, 18:15 - / James Ball: in the stefan club
24/07/2020, 18:15 - Sam;: This message was deleted
24/07/2020, 18:15 - Sam;: Can we get a torso pic from him? Willing to swap pics
24/07/2020, 18:17 - / James Ball: like stefan's waterfall pic on facebook you mean?
24/07/2020, 18:18 - Sam;: Anything
24/07/2020, 18:18 - / James Ball: where stefan looks so ripped his neck might explode
24/07/2020, 18:28 - Stefan;: The neck muscle is slowly strangling me
24/07/2020, 18:31 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 18:40 - / James Ball: lol
24/07/2020, 18:40 - / James Ball: his face looks like my brother when he was ripped
24/07/2020, 18:42 - Sam;: Obvs has got a blunt. I’ll still take it though
24/07/2020, 18:42 - Sam;: He looks like David Bentley now
24/07/2020, 19:00 - Rob;: That's normal built, not 'how do you fit through doors?' Stefan built
24/07/2020, 19:08 - Phill: Found some photos at my grans
24/07/2020, 19:08 - Phill: <Media omitted>
24/07/2020, 19:08 - Phill: Boozer
24/07/2020, 19:09 - Sam;: But immaculately dressed.
24/07/2020, 19:09 - Sam;: Dressed to booze
24/07/2020, 19:20 - / James Ball: Look like a 50 year old dwarf
24/07/2020, 19:32 - Rob;: Yeah big Bilbo vibes
24/07/2020, 19:34 - Sam;: You dream of wearing that exact outfit as a guest at Farage’s birthday Paul
24/07/2020, 19:37 - Phill: <Media omitted>

24/07/2020, 20:52 - Stefan;: Coconut fish curry - only needs a few basic spices - curry powder, cumin, chili flakes
24/07/2020, 20:58 - David;: I mean this sounds great.
24/07/2020, 20:58 - David;: All good calls
24/07/2020, 20:59 - David;: How would one go about salmon en croute
24/07/2020, 20:59 - David;: Fish in a curry though. Can this be trusted?
24/07/2020, 21:00 - David;: Anyone tried making fish tacos?
24/07/2020, 21:00 - / James Ball: Yeah they are good
24/07/2020, 21:00 - / James Ball: Need really fresh fish for best effect though
24/07/2020, 21:00 - / James Ball: Nice lime and coriander flavour
24/07/2020, 21:01 - Rob;: Did fish tacos with ceviche we made once. Went to Billingsgate at 5am for it
24/07/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: White fish is excellent in a curry
24/07/2020, 21:02 - Rob;: Something like monkfish would be premium
24/07/2020, 21:04 - Stefan;: Just use a plain fish like cod
24/07/2020, 21:04 - Stefan;: Can go half sweet potato half fish as well

24/07/2020, 21:07 - Rob;: Paul the tyrant
24/07/2020, 21:08 - / James Ball: Not Yam
24/07/2020, 21:09 - Rob;: While on starchy sweet stuff: deep fry plantain is goat
24/07/2020, 21:09 - Rob;: Or barbecued
24/07/2020, 21:10 - / James Ball: Yeah plantain and goat curry is nice. Just the bones. The old boney goat
24/07/2020, 21:10 - Paul;: Goat is GOAT
24/07/2020, 21:14 - Damian Rumble: Here I was reading this delicious description of meals thinking "I should try to make some of these" and then bam! A reminder of that time I looked like I came from Auschwitz. Unsettling
24/07/2020, 21:14 - / James Ball: Facebook saw fit to remind me so I saw fit to remind you all
24/07/2020, 21:14 - / James Ball: I mean, I could have shared the memory on Facebook instead?
24/07/2020, 21:15 - / James Ball: Also it was almost half our lives ago at this point
24/07/2020, 21:16 - David;: I like the concept of goat
24/07/2020, 21:16 - David;: Not sure if I've ever had it
24/07/2020, 21:17 - Rob;: Stringier lamb
24/07/2020, 21:17 - David;: That's how they market it?
24/07/2020, 21:17 - David;: Needs better PR
24/07/2020, 21:18 - Rob;: A bit darker and tougher, so lends itself to slow cooking
24/07/2020, 21:18 - Rob;: So it's like lamb without the option of having it pink
24/07/2020, 21:18 - David;: Rich flavour?
24/07/2020, 21:18 - Rob;: Yeah yeah
24/07/2020, 21:18 - David;: I'm interested in pork belly
24/07/2020, 21:18 - David;: Getting the really crisp rind etc.
24/07/2020, 21:20 - Damian Rumble: Mutton curry. Very goat
24/07/2020, 21:20 - Rob;: Yeah yeah like meaty crackling
24/07/2020, 21:21 - Rob;: It makes a great roast if you alter it on top of roasties. Bastes them in fat
24/07/2020, 21:21 - Rob;: *layer it
24/07/2020, 21:21 - David;: Yeah that sounds great
24/07/2020, 21:22 - David;: Soaking things in fat is generally a good move
24/07/2020, 21:22 - / James Ball: Made a good stew with pork belly, bacon and chickpeas recently
24/07/2020, 21:23 - / James Ball: Very rich and meaty
24/07/2020, 21:26 - Rob;: Imagine being an animal that was hunted for meat and overhearing them talking about pairing your belly with your bum
24/07/2020, 21:32 - / James Ball: Bacon more from back area than arse area no?
24/07/2020, 21:33 - David;: Yeah never heard that bacon was the arse
24/07/2020, 21:33 - David;: Always sold the back line
24/07/2020, 21:34 - / James Ball: Rump arguably more of an arse cut?
24/07/2020, 21:36 - Rob;: True, more ham/gammon from the pigs arse
24/07/2020, 21:37 - Rob;: Either way, odd to think of different bits of your anatomy complement eachother
24/07/2020, 21:50 - / James Ball: A nice bit of thigh with that breast 🌝
24/07/2020, 21:53 - Damian Rumble: I'm not sure it's that odd. It's all the same species. What's probably more odd is the concept of wrapping a chicken the back of a pig
24/07/2020, 22:31 - David;: But we can do that
24/07/2020, 22:31 - David;: Top of the food chain is GOAT
24/07/2020, 22:38 - Phill: Heh. Good luck.
24/07/2020, 22:38 - David;: Lol
24/07/2020, 22:39 - David;: Not simple?
24/07/2020, 22:40 - Phill: If your oven doesnt have a 240 setting then youre fucked
24/07/2020, 22:40 - Rob;: You can make pork puff at gas 9/220
24/07/2020, 22:41 - David;: Pork puff?
24/07/2020, 22:41 - David;: That sounds like a homophobic slur
24/07/2020, 22:41 - Rob;: You can make it puff up and crisp into crackling
24/07/2020, 22:42 - Rob;: Actually gas 7 is technically 220
24/07/2020, 22:42 - David;: I just want delicious succulent pork inside with a crispy rind cracking. Tell me how to get that
24/07/2020, 22:43 - / James Ball: High temp
24/07/2020, 22:43 - / James Ball: Salt
24/07/2020, 22:43 - Rob;: Low and slow most of the time, with foil over, as hot as your oven will go for about 15 mins at the beginning or end uncovered until it goes crisp
24/07/2020, 22:43 - David;: Salt. Fat. Acid. Shart.
24/07/2020, 22:45 - Rob;: You can always cut off the fat layer if your meat has cooked through before the fat crisps, then cook it separately while the meat rests
25/07/2020, 00:00 - Phill: For perfect crackling follow this recipe:
25/07/2020, 00:00 - Phill: Pork shoulder
25/07/2020, 00:00 - Phill: Or leg
25/07/2020, 00:00 - Phill: Dry thoroughly with kitchen paper
25/07/2020, 00:01 - Phill: Completely thoroughly
25/07/2020, 00:01 - Phill: Dryer than your nans
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: Then slice the skin. To the fat. Not through the fat
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: Crosshatch that cunt.
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: Smash the salt into it.
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: Smash it.
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: Really smash it.
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: Leave it.
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: For 2hr.
25/07/2020, 00:02 - Phill: Oven. Max.
25/07/2020, 00:03 - Phill: Heat it.
25/07/2020, 00:03 - Phill: To max. Just maximise it.
25/07/2020, 00:03 - Phill: Put pork in.
25/07/2020, 00:04 - Phill: 30mins. Just blasting that cunt with heat.
25/07/2020, 00:04 - Phill: Turn heat down to 170z
25/07/2020, 00:04 - Phill: Go for a few pints.
25/07/2020, 00:04 - Phill: Remove.
25/07/2020, 00:04 - Phill: Done.
25/07/2020, 01:10 - Damian Rumble: You deleted this message
25/07/2020, 01:10 - Damian Rumble: https://youtu.be/CtUuOIXLawg
25/07/2020, 01:11 - Damian Rumble: Had to explain Sarah who Jimmy savile was
25/07/2020, 12:01 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/07/2020, 12:11 - David;: This broad innings
25/07/2020, 12:11 - Phill: <Media omitted>
25/07/2020, 12:13 - Jack G;: Loving it, will get him pumped up for bowling too
25/07/2020, 12:21 - David;: Broad.
25/07/2020, 12:21 - David;: 38 now
25/07/2020, 12:23 - David;: Could get a little halfy
25/07/2020, 12:23 - David;: So troll for West Indies
25/07/2020, 12:24 - Jack G;: Dat cheeky grin after holder threw the ball at the stumps
25/07/2020, 12:24 - David;: Fat bloke on now
25/07/2020, 12:38 - Jack G;: A casual 50 for broad
25/07/2020, 12:40 - Jack G;: Faster than stoke’s 50 in the last test
25/07/2020, 12:43 - David;: Highest score since 2913 ashes
25/07/2020, 12:43 - David;: *2013
25/07/2020, 12:59 - David;: Would like Curran > Woakes
25/07/2020, 12:59 - David;: Anderson, Broad, Archer, Curran and Stokes would be GOAT
25/07/2020, 13:05 - Jack G;: Don’t think you need Curran or Woakes if you’ve got Anderson, Broad, Archer and Stokes in the team. I think Stokes is slightly injured for this test and not bowling which is why they’ve dropped a batsman
25/07/2020, 13:41 - David;: But with Stokes counting as a top order batsmen you may as well take 4 more pace bowlers. Able to rotate more
25/07/2020, 14:00 - Jack G;: Yeah yeah, would have preferred Curran for this test but in normal circumstances with Stokes bowling not required. Curran can rotate in for whichever of Anderson/Broad is rested
