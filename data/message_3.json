      "content": "Soccer fans of the Chelsea Franchise Club have been making their way to Amsterdam this week for their Minor Eurosoccer Cup final tie with Portugaleze franchise Ben Fica.\n\nIn a week of real crazy soccer drama, talk of the Blue Lions\u00e2\u0080\u0099 tie has been minimized. First there was the shock news that Coach Sir Alexi Ferguson would be retirizing, and then the Wigan Warriors went and took the England Soccer Cup back to the DW40 soccer stadium.\n\nIn some ways, this may have helped Coach Beneathez.\n\nFor him, this season has been tough right from the point he got hired by Roman Ibrahimovic. The home fans at Stanford Bridge have hollered real bad stuff at him and have become famous for taking banners that say \u00e2\u0080\u0098Reject Rafa\u00e2\u0080\u0099 to all their soccer ties.\n\nDespite being put under huge pressure, Coach Rafa stands on the edge of bringing his franchise their most major Eurosoccer Cup victory in their history.\n\nChelsea will be without some of their best kickers of a soccerball for the tie.\n\nTerry John is among those missing the trip to Scandinavia after getting his foot hurt in the EPL tie at Vanilla Park on Saturday. However, curly-haired David Louise and Ray Mearez look like they will both do soccer against their old soccer franchise.\n\nBen Fica, coached by Coach George Jesus, will be looking to win the soccer tie too. Chelsea will be the favourites in the eyes of many soccer fans, but Ben Fica soccer fans will have faith in Coach Jesus.\n\nThere are times when their soccer has been like a real big soccer firework \u00e2\u0080\u0093 dangerous up close but real nice to watch and enjoy from a safe distance.\n\nWith Juan Mourinho looking like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna replace Coach Rafa, the tie completion whistle will also complete his time coaching soccer at Stanford Bridge.\n\nIf it finishes in Blue Lions victory, it will be a pretty neat way of proving to his doubters that he is an awesome soccer coach after all.\n\nSure, he may be about to be rejected, but replacing Coach Rafa may need an extra \u00e2\u0080\u0098Special Juan\u00e2\u0080\u0099 if he gets his Spanish hands on that shiny cup.",

The overwhelming power he gets on his shots would make even Hulk Hogan cower in fear and wet his pants in the corner. Not only is it overwhelmingly powerful, but it is deadly accurate, like the bullet of a sniper rifle, or the free kick of Roberto Carlos in his prime. But if you think his forehand is good, well, let me tell you, it is merely a hamster when compared to the roaring Grizzly bear that is his backstroke. His backhand is possible the most beautiful move in sports history- A rabona from Zidane, a right hook from Ali, a racial slur from John Terry, a backstroke from Murray.\n\nNot only are his shots incredible deadly, they are also impossible to read, as though they are written in Arabic by Michael J Fox. You can see the look of confusion in his opponents eyes as he swaggers arrogantly to the net, before choosing his shot more casually than a fat person choosing something from the menu at the Chinese. Then, BOOM, he has made his shot, and he is 15-0 up.\n\nThat is not the only part of his game that makes him the all time best. His ability to smash exceeds even that of Richard Keys, and his all round attitude ensures he gets the results his natural talent should bring.\n\nI am honoured to watch him play. In 50 years we will have statues of him in every town square across Britain, and will tell stories of Andrew Murray, to our children, all of whom are named Andrew Murray. He is my hero.",

It's because they were played by real actors in makeup and wielding actual weaponry, monsters who had a presence that CGI just can't recreate. The phoniness of these CG-heavy creatures makes The Hobbit feel as inorganic to LOTR as the prequels were to the original Star Wars films.\nThere's actually a lot of less than jaw-dropping visual effects work here, whether it's Azog -- who looks like he walked out of a video game -- or the horde that chases Radagast the Brown (Sylvester McCoy) or the wargs. The Goblin King (Barry Humphries) and his minions are all CGI. At a certain point during battle scenes with these CGI characters it becomes evident that the main actors are swinging at nothing; you never get the sense anything's actually connecting and thus you're never fully invested in these battles or what happens to anyone in them. It's makes you think that if you went 20 minutes in any direction outside of The Shire you'd end up in Toon Town. Add in the brighter landscapes and The Hobbit often looks more like a Narnia film than an LOTR one.",

If you want to travel round Georgia lots and see other cities and the countryside etc. it would be a bit more (although i think transport is fairly cheap). They even have a skiing resort which is apparently quite good and relatively cheap which we could go to for a couple of days. But if you more want to chill out in the capital, go to the markets and bars, see sights, do some shopping, get pissed, go to what my boss has called 'the sketchy-ist night out in Tbilisi' etc. then it would be pretty cheap. Cost of living is not much, food and drink are pretty cheap. \n\nOne thing I really want to do is hire out a room at these hot springs/ turkish bath type place where its like a sauna, hot pool and cold pool and you can have people rub you down with camel hair or something.
